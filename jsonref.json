He grew up in Leipzig and spent his childhood under communism, then his teens, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, under capitalism he was fascinated to see familiar streetscapes colonised by advertising hoardings. His career has reflected that dichotomy. He has worked as a commercial photographer to fund an enduring fascination with the post-Soviet atmospheres of the east. When fellow art students relocated to London or Berlin after graduating, he settled in Moscow and began making photographs of the city’s interiors, taking his Hasselblad camera into waiting rooms and tiled hotel lobbies and curious bars, alive to juxtaposition and surreal comedy.This picture was taken in the meadows on the banks of the River Moscow, on the fringe of the 850th anniversary park. The contrast in scale and tone between the picnicking mother and her toddler and the vast, foreboding architecture of the electricity pylons is typical of Herfort’s work. He is drawn to scenes in which people innocently inhabit places slightly beyond their understanding, as if they have been dropped there from a different time and place altogether.There is something about what he calls the “chaos and the lightness and good-naturedness of ordinary Russians” that he tries to frame in different ways. The contrasts between the pictures he takes are as important as the contrasts within them. “I was always interested in shooting single photographs,” he says, “which show worlds and stories in one image.” He finds the classical reportage style, where you photograph 30 images of a story in series, too repetitive. “I think you can skip the before, after and in between. This is for me photography, the art of using just one frame.”Russian Fairytales by Frank Herfort will be published by Kerber Verlag (£36) later this spring"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d5b3951416ad6ba8f2747bfa657a57fb56a85de/190_596_3674_2204/master/3674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ad6c90a62559430d5e9b530fd66d497","title":"how we made keep calm and carry on poster","story":"‘When I’m asked why it’s so popular, I always say the same thing: it’s cheaper than antidepressants’ The original poster was part of a trio designed during the second world war by the Ministry of Information. After the first two went out – Your Courage, Your Cheerfulness, Your Resolution Will Bring Us Victory and Freedom Is in Peril  Defend It With All Your Might – scathing letters appeared in the Times saying they were patronising. I think that’s why Keep Calm was held back and never publicly displayed, and the bulk of copies either pulped or lost. If they had started with this one, I think it would have been just as popular then as it is now. It was a winner, they just didn’t realise it.I first found the poster in 2000, folded up at the bottom of a box of books we had bought at an auction. I liked it straight away and showed it to my wife Mary – she had it framed and put up in the shop. The next thing we found was that customers wanted to buy it. I suggested we make copies but Mary said: “No, it’ll spoil the purity.” She went away for a week’s holiday, so I secretly got 500 copies made.I showed Mary the sales figures. She’s a very practical person, and from then on we started making more. For the next two years it was a huge local and regional hit, but not a national hit. That wasn’t until 2005 when a reporter called Susie Steiner from the  did a little one-page feature, showing the Keep Calm poster as one of her favourite things. After that, all hell broke loose.It was in December, so a perfect Christmas present. We got thousands of orders. And that’s really when the phenomenon began. Then people started copying it, ridiculing it and doing all sorts of things with it. It just grew and grew. It’s probably fair to say that by the end of 2006, when I was down in London and saw a Keep Calm mug with “Made in China” on the bottom, that it had gone international. Lots of people jumped on the bandwagon and, frankly, some of the parodies I got sick to the teeth of. But the actual basic message has helped a lot of people, I think. When I’m asked why it was so popular, I always say the same thing: it’s cheaper than antidepressants.We’ve probably sold somewhere in the region of 100,000 copies to date. In the last year or so, we’ve typically only had two or three orders a month. Suddenly, with coronavirus, we’re getting a dozen a week – nothing like what happened back in 2005, but enough to prove it has a timeless resonance. Although it probably needs updating – Keep Calm and Stay at Home.I discovered Keep Calm and Carry On in 2005 when I went on a writing retreat in Devon. The poster was on the wall of the kitchen where we all gathered to cook and eat meals. I was told it came from a tiny bookshop in Alnwick. At the time I was working at the ’s Weekend magazine, and when I got back I rang Barter Books and requested a poster to include in a roundup of things for the home. I could tell it was a “thing” not only because of my own reaction – I took a sense of comfort from it – but also because other people in the office really loved it and wanted to have one too.I wasn’t surprised that it quickly became popular. I’m glad Barter Books did well out of it. A contributing factor was that there was no copyright attached to the poster, which meant a proliferation of products could occur without companies incurring fees. I am, at this moment, drinking from a mug which says: Keep Calm I’m a Teenager.I don’t think the blame for Keep Calm can be laid at my door. I responded to the poster myself, then showed it to the readership, and a market sprang up. I think it’s had its day now. But I did like a version I saw at the National Centre for Birds of Prey, at Duncombe Park. There is a sign up there which says Keep Calm and Carrion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4851981d30bae29b33dae69eabd011b7e57ed1f2/49_95_1374_825/master/1374.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=124aac8e1fe00a7c3297be75f4c888bb","title":"peter beard artist of life camera photographer conservation","story":"He got trampled by elephants, swam in crocodile-infested waters and was painted by Francis Bacon – while making images revealing man’s plunder of the natural worldThe American writer Bob Colacello once described the young Peter Beard, who has died aged 82, as “half-Tarzan, half-Byron”, neatly encapsulating the larger-than-life charisma of an artist whose reputation for adventure and excess often overshadowed his creative talent. As a 2007 Vanity Fair profile put it: “Whether he’s at a New York nightclub or deep in the African wilderness, world-famous photographer and artist Peter Beard is surrounded by drugs, debts, and beautiful women.”Born into considerable wealth and privilege in New York, Beard, whose body was found yesterday in woodland in the East Hamptons, was a photographer whose love for the African wilderness and its fragile ecology was first expressed in The End of the Game, a 1965 photo-book that now seems extraordinarily prescient. It comprised beautiful but heart-rending images that laid bare the fate of thousands of starving elephants, rhinos and hippos in Tsavo national Park in Kenya.By the 1970s, Beard had created a singular formal signature through his combining of photographs, text from his daily journals and all manner of tangentially related found objects from dried leaves and insects to newspaper cuttings. Some of his assemblages were further decorated by animal blood, and sometimes by his own blood. He was a man of often dramatic extremes: a leading character in an adventure of his own making. He saw Africa as the ultimate escape as well as a kind of vocation.On visits to London, Beard hung out with and posed for Francis Bacon, who painted several portraits of him. On his regular jaunts to New York, he photographed fashion campaigns and partied with the likes of Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger and Jacqueline Onassis – whom he famously photographed skinny-dipping. His former girlfriends include the actors Candice Bergen and Caroline Bouquet, and he was married for a time to the model Cheryl Tiegs, their orce prompting him to declare marriage “unnatural” in its “overwhelming claustrophobia”.Most of the time, though, Beard lived at the Hog Ranch, a property comprising large tents on the edge of the Ngong Hills in Kenya. His next-door neighbour was Karen Blixen, the Danish author whose account of her life in Kenya was turned into the acclaimed Hollywood film Out of Africa. In the above-mentioned Vanity Fair profile, the journalist described Beard, then 69, emerging from his tent at Hog Ranch trailed by four or five Ethiopian women, all of whom had shared his bed.In Kenya, his freewheeling lifestyle meant he often courted tragedy. He swam in crocodile-infested rivers and, on more than one occasion, witnessed the death of someone who did not make it out of the water. In 1996, while photographing near the Tanzanian border, Beard was charged by an elephant, impaled and trampled. On his way to hospital in Nairobi, he almost died of his internal injuries. By then, his reputation for recklessness was such that few of his African acquaintances were surprised by his brush with death.Beard remained unrepentant into old age: an artist with a cavalier disregard for his own safety, but also for photography and his own place within the photographic tradition. A 2013 profile in New York magazine focused on attempts by his wife, Nejma, to belatedly put his house in order so that both his artistic and financial legacy would be assured. The year before, two of his works had sold at auction for just over half a million dollars each. It was a turning point in a singular adventure in photography marked by privilege, excess, and a seeming unwillingness to treat his own work with the respect it deserved. “I don’t mind the word ‘dilettante,’” he once said of himself. “A dilettante means someone who does what he loves.”In many ways, Beard belonged to an older, more aristocratic world, with his film star looks and playboy lifestyle buoyed by inherited wealth and fuelled by a devil-may-care attitude that was often reckless in the extreme. His humanity was revealed in the work he made his hybrid images a reflection of a restless creative imagination and a deep commitment to the cause of reversing an impending African ecological catastrophe. In this, he was undeniably far-sighted. One doubts whether the art world – or the Kenyan wildlife community – will see his like again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/010ee661e7492c2eef19886e8b8d80aa5acf8a40/0_163_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e1098349cb5dffb4ee34843e618eb88","title":"supermarket staff workers tell us coronavirus affected your work","story":"Are you under extra pressure?

It has been engaged with online more than 220,000 times, with museums from Germany, France, Canada and the USA responding.The National Museums of Scotland responded with a Germolene-pink “mermaid” with oogly eyes and rotting teeth.News of the battle soon crossed the Atlantic, with the museums on Prince Edward Island, Canada, submitting their entry: a cursed children’s toy they claimed to have found hidden inside the walls of a 155-year-old mansion: “We call it ‘Wheelie’ - and it MOVES ON ITS OWN: Staff put it in one place and find it in another spot later on …”In Germany, the Deutsches Historisches Museum (German History Museum) played a strong card with a terrifying beaked plague mask from between 1650 and 1750.Oxford’s Ashmolean thought it could do better, submitting a carved pendant with a dead man’s face on one side and a decaying skull with worms and other creatures on the reverse from southern Germany.Also in Oxford, the Pitt Rivers museum offered a “sheep’s heart stuck with pins and nails, to be worn like a necklace for breaking evil spells”.Back in York, the city’s Castle Museum was feeling confident: “STEP ASIDE ALL. These are hand-made models of figures playing cards and of gold miners hauling gold nuggets to the surface. BUT the figures are made from crab’s legs and claws … Typical Victorians – they loved weirdcreepy stuff. #CreepiestObject”The Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds felt it could outdo its Yorkshire cousin, entering a gruesome iron mask it believes is part of a “scold’s bridle” – an iron muzzle designed for public humiliation.On the Yorkshire coast, the team looking after the Clarke charm collection in Scarborough offered a human finger bone used by a gambler to bring good luck and a dead man’s tooth used to hang around a baby’s neck “to prevent convulsions brought on by teething”.Then the Bexhill Museum in East Sussex got in on the act with this bloated “zombie blowfish”:In Scotland, the head of applied conservation at Historic Environment Scotland proffered this grotesque piece of whimsy: a man’s distorted face painted on a whale’s eardrum.Millicent Carroll at York Museums Trust said: “The curator battle has been gradually building as more and more museums and the general public look at our Twitter feed every Friday to see what theme we’re going to pitch. Last week’s best egg contest had replies from the Hermitage in Russia and the American Museum of National History, but the creepiest object has taken it to another level.“It is great for us and other museums to be able to still share our collections with the public when our doors are closed. We just hope we haven’t given anyone any nightmares!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb3800b061c3cbcad635f41d312f76550bca777d/0_87_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fc281fc5a51dee58719d1f78635b834","title":"i told my university i was harassed online they asked me what a hashtag was","story":"Social media has existed for years, but universities are only just realising they must protect students from online abuseI experienced how frustrating and convoluted the system is when I was harassed online by a fellow student during my final semester at the University of Bath in 2018. At multiple points each week, Instagram posts were made using images lifted from my social media with derogatory captions. He tagged me in Facebook posts and wrote blog posts about me. Many of these were misogynistic: I was dubbed as having “daddy issues”, and called a “cunt” and a “bitch”.Our students’ union initially said they would handle it, but I decided to file my own complaint when the harassment escalated to an attempt to remove me from the university. In my first meeting with the professor conducting the investigation, I was asked what a hashtag was. Even now it’s still not clear what procedure was being followed. During the month-long investigation, the harassment escalated to death threats and the police got involved. I was told that calling 999 from my phone would trigger an emergency response. I struggled to sleep. I began locking doors every time I was alone. When people noticed, I said it was because of a draft I did not want to tell them that I was terrified. Even if I tried ignoring the posts, Bath was a small university – plenty of people would bring them up to me in passing. I was humiliated.I’m not alone in having experienced this. One of the women targeted by a “rape chat” at the University of Warwick said it wasn’t a safe place to study for women and minorities, after she was expected to sit a final exam alongside one of the men disciplined in her case. I agree that there have been some astounding institutional failures. Universities UK published guidelines on how to tackle online harassment last year. These need to be a wake-up call for higher education, as social media has been ubiquitous among students for almost a decade now. Universities need to train their staff better: it shouldn’t be up to a victim to explain how social media works to the people conducting investigations. The consequences of sexual harassment can be severe and exacerbated by time, so investigations need to be thorough but quick. No student should have to deal with escalating online sexual harassment for months on end the way I did.Advice should be more nuanced, too. I wish that the answer was as simple as “lock down your social media posts and block people”, but this feels too similar to “don’t wear short skirts and drink too much”.For students who find themselves unsupported by official university procedures, I would recommend reaching out to any counselling services available. Document both the harassment and the communication with the university. Follow up with your students’ union or other external student groups. Hopefully they too will realise that this kind of behaviour cannot continue to go unpunished.More than a year after the events, I reached out to the University of Bath to find out what decision was made over my complaint. I was told that my complaint was upheld and disciplinary action had been taken, with no further information. I wonder if I would be comforted by the phrase “disciplinary action” if I had decided to stay at the university for postgraduate studies. Months of harassment and procedure, with two words as the result. At least I can take comfort in the fact that Bath are changing their policies and procedures, which should hopefully protect other students. I can only hope that other universities are realising the need to change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91563b8e3f4441bff411667b078e8b219edef27e/0_322_5159_3095/master/5159.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01577ce060389dadbe3b48e6b1dbbb39","title":"parents share your experiences of home schooling coronavirus","story":"As schools start in the UK we want to hear from parents and students about working from home due to coronavirusPupils at schools in the UK will be expected to stay at home for at least three weeks as the government extended the lockdown.We want to hear from parents on their experiences of having their children for home schooling.What has your experience been like?

It is self-evidently unwise to force hundreds of people into small rooms in small buildings during a pandemic.“Some teachers have already tragically died from the virus, and we do not want to risk any more,” wrote Wilson, a member of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, in an open letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock.The erging approaches to school closures may stem from the considerable uncertainty around the extent to which children are playing a role in spreading Covid-19.“It seems most plausible to me that they are being infected but are at low risk of developing disease,” said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “We know that for flu, children are important transmitters of infection, which is the basis for the flu vaccination programme directed at children, but we do not know yet how important they are as transmitters of coronavirus. So closing schools would be based on the assumption that they do make an important contribution to transmission.”Rates of various illnesses are seen to rise and fall at the start and end of school terms. School holidays were thought to have led to a plateau in the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Also advised hygiene and social distancing measures, such as hand washing and reduced physical contact, just aren’t very effective in a primary school playground setting. So there is the potential for schools to act as a local fountain of infection for the surrounding area.“Every mother and father knows that when kids go back to school they’re going to get hammered by colds and flus and sore throats,” said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.This uncertain science has to be carefully weighed against the certain disruption and cost of school closures, including taking large numbers of doctors and nurses out of the workplace, and unintended consequences such as grandparents, who are among the most vulnerable, taking on childcare and facing greater exposure.On Monday, as the summer term began with millions of children in lockdown, one headteacher described the challenge of trying to keep the small number of pupils currently in the emergency schools, which are open to vulnerable children and those of key workers, at a safe distance from each other.“It’s almost impossible,” said Richard Sheriff, chief executive of the Red Kite Alliance, which runs nine primary schools and four secondary schools across Leeds and North Yorkshire. “We’ve got 56 children in one primary school this morning and the school is full because we’re using social distancing to keep them apart. Every time they move from a table, somebody comes and wipes it. Every time they use a badminton racquet, someone wipes the handle. It’s not easy.”Pupils “returning” to school at home accessed more than a quarter of million lessons provided by the government’s new virtual academy, the Oak National Academy, which opened on Monday.Created by more than 40 primary and secondary school teachers to keep children learning during the coronavirus lockdown, Oak aims to provide more than 180 lessons a week, with video tutorials and resources for teachers to support online learning already being provided by schools.On its inaugural day, 140,000 students took part in an English lesson and almost 120,000 did maths, while the most popular single session was counting up to 10 for reception pupils, followed by reading comprehension for seven- and eight-year-olds. Poetry comprehension and Henry VIII were also popular.On Sunday the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, moved to quell continuing speculation about schools reopening to all pupils, insisting that ministers would not contemplate it until the government’s five tests for beating the pandemic are met, but headteachers and local authorities are worried about the continuing uncertainty.The tests are: protecting the NHS’s ability to cope a fall in daily death rates reliable data showing decreasing infection rates confidence in testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) capacity and confidence that changes to the government’s approach won’t risk a second peak of infections.Many in the sector remain concerned, however, about not just when but how a return to school will be effected, and there are fears that the longer schools remain closed, the greater the loss of learning, particularly for more disadvantaged pupils who may struggle to engage with online lessons.“Schools are working hard to deliver the best learning possible to pupils at home,” said Jules White, the headteacher at Tanbridge House school, Horsham, West Sussex. “The reality is, however, that self teaching is very hard even when there is strong family support.“Whilst many issues need to be resolved for schools to open more fully, we must begin to think about further prioritising children who struggle most with learning andor come from disadvantaged circumstances. When it’s safe they must get back into schools in larger numbers than we are seeing at present.”Wilson’s letter warned: “Until we know that children will not learn that their teacher has died because of an infection caught in their class, we should remain sensible and wait.“The economic harm of keeping schools closed is significant – but is known. This means the government can act and intervene to mitigate this harm. We do not know about the harms of reopening schools yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74d07c617c2a7c5dee47f0f2cfbfa8dad2dae983/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f123abef993c79425927b61cf3c530a6","title":"deepwater horizon 10 years later could it happen again","story":"The danger of deepwater oil operations, combined with the loosening of Obama-era rules, mean the risk of a repeat disaster is highA massive deepwater oil spill is nearly as likely today as it was in 2010, experts warn, 10 years after the disastrous explosion of BP’s rig in the Gulf of Mexico that caused an environmental catastrophe.The blowout killed 11 workers and spewed 4m barrels of petroleum into the ocean for 87 days before it could be capped, devastating marine life and polluting 1,300 miles of shoreline. Thousands were put out of work in oil, fisheries and tourism.But experts say an incident of similar scale could happen again and has been made more likely by the Trump administration’s decision to loosen Obama-era safety rules. Those standards had grown from an independent commission’s damning findings of corporate and regulatory failures leading up to the spill.Frances Ulmer, who served on the commission and is a visiting fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School, said the government and industry have not made sufficient changes to prevent or respond to another mammoth spill.“Disasters like oil spills will happen again because this is an extremely high-risk operation, particularly when you’re talking about drilling for oil over a mile of water and then a couple miles down under the sea floor,” she said. “There are a lot of things that can go wrong.”Frances Beinecke, another commission member and the former president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, echoed those worries.“Of course it could happen again, and I think one of the things of most concern is that our ability to control a spill is pretty much the same as it was 10 years prior,” Beinecke said. Richard Sears, the commission’s senior science and engineering adviser, who formerly worked for Shell and is now an adjunct professor at Stanford University, said an accident like Deepwater Horizon was less likely now but “there are a lot worse scenarios that could happen in deepwater”.“Everybody has to stay vigilant,” Sears said. He believes the Trump rule changes do not significantly weaken well safety but could do more to limit industry risk.Outside of safety concerns, the scientific community is also increasingly encouraging world leaders to consider that any new oil development is unwise, as emissions from fossil fuels exacerbate global heating, threatening human civilization.In the wake of the BP disaster, the US interior department restructured in a bid to allow a new ision of the agency, the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (BSEE), to focus on safety. The move was meant to separate safety regulators from government officials who might be more incentivized by the money coming in from taxes on drilling.The Obama administration beefed up safety rules, including checks on blowout preventers like the one that failed on BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig.Now Trump has weakened those standards at the behest of the industry’s trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, including allowing inspections by non-government-accredited contractors.Trump has pushed an agenda of “energy dominance”, which critics say encourages industry to take risks.A constant ally of fossil fuels, Trump has sought to allow drilling in nearly all coastal waters in the US – more than 1bn acres in the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and Gulf of Mexico.His officials have been accommodating to the corporations they regulate, with BSEE’s director repeatedly calling them “partners”.“BSEE is transitioning from an era of isolation to cooperation, from creating hardships to creating partnerships,” the bureau director, Scott Angelle, said at an industry symposium in August 2017.Internal emails suggest expert agency staffers have disagreed with the rollbacks to drilling safety rules and Angelle has refused to document their concerns. Staffers at BSEE who spoke anonymously to E\u0026ampE News depict a “broken” agency run by Angelle, who is a former Louisiana politician and longtime supporter of the gulf oil industry.“BSEE is focused on ensuring energy development is conducted in a safe and smart manner,” a spokesman, Sandy Day, told the , maintaining that the industry was vastly different from what it was 10 years ago.Meanwhile, drillers have moved farther and deeper offshore, pursuing wells with enough oil to produce for decades, known in the industry as “elephants”. Low oil prices – from a boom in production on land following the discovery of fracking – haven’t kept them out of the water. Most of the $93m in leases sold by the US in the gulf last month were in deep water.“Offshore drilling is going after bigger and bigger wells that have more and more oil,” said Bob Deans, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council who co-wrote a book on the BP disaster. “These are being drilled in deep water and they’re being drilled in high pressure wells that are harder to control. And they’re being drilled in more complex geology.”The Deepwater Horizon rig reached about 5,000ft, or close to a mile, down. Other platforms still operating in the gulf are as deep or deeper. One drilled in 2001, called “Blind Faith”, is still producing, according to 2019 documents from Chevron. It reaches 7,000ft to the gulf floor.Deans called the current regulatory approach “an honor system” that “smacks of exactly the kind of self-enforcement that the independent commission found to be a fatal flaw” in the BP blowout.“Definitely, it could happen again,” he said. “You cannot make these operations safe. All you can do is try to reduce the risk.”Smaller-scale incidents that don’t make the news occur frequently in the gulf. Between 2007 and 2018, there were an average of 115 fires and explosions in federal waters annually, about one every three days, according to government data. There were also nearly 50 fatalities over that time.Donald Boesch, a biological oceanographer and president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, who was also on the commission, said Trump’s changes have undermined offshore safety.“Many steps have been taken by both government and industry since the accident 10 years ago … I felt comfortable – not that the risk was reduced to negligible – but that we were in better shape now than we were,” Boesch said. “I’ve frankly been made more concerned about how the safety issues are being treated under the Trump administration.”Still, sources familiar with industry say the big companies learned a lesson as they watched BP suffer huge reputational damage and pay $65bn for its mistakes.Wesley Williams, a petroleum engineering professor at Louisiana State University, who was awarded a nearly $5m research grant from a fund BP was forced to pay into, said the “real motivator” for industry was “the image issue that happened and the financial cost of what happened to BP”.“From the large operators, I’ve seen a big change in safety culture,” Williams said.But the sector consists of more than just the brands most people can identify, like BP, Shell and Exxon. Those companies work with large networks of contractors, and smaller independent operators are active in the gulf too. Williams said they did not always have the resources for extensive safety training.John Amos, president of SkyTruth, a not-for-profit conservation technology organization, said:“The next major oil spill, when it happens, will catch us off guard … like every previous one has, unless we decide that this time it’s going to be different,” Amos said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69d72ab36ffe164d7b3d9c0c8363e26ffcc08cce/0_186_5202_3121/master/5202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d6ad21abcbe117ebe6b5b7c5056b857","title":"no way food safety not compromised us regulatory roll backs during covid 19 criticised","story":"Major pork plant closed after hundreds of workers contract coronavirus, while speeding up of poultry production lines raises concerns over standardsThe US government is accelerating controversial regulatory rollbacks to speed up production at meat plants, as companies express growing alarm at the impact of Covid-19 on their operations.The latest line speed increases, announced by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) mean 11 poultry plants have been given waivers to operate higher line speeds in the past fortnight. A number of beef and pork plants have also been given waivers, including a beef plant in Kansas in late March. The move will allow the additional chicken factories to slaughter as many as 175 birds a minute – the equivalent of 3 per second.A union representing federal food safety inspectors has said faster lines will make it harder to catch “pathology that shouldn’t be going out to the consumers”.Increased line speeds are supported by the poultry industry, which argues they do not represent additional risk to food or workers safety, and are necessary to remain financially competitive. Three years ago the National Chicken Council lobbied the government to scrap line speed limits completely, calling them “arbitrary”.Under traditional poultry processing rules, line speeds ran at 140 birds a minute, and required at least four inspectors to be stationed on each line, tasked with checking carcasses for defects, disease or contamination, including fecal matter which can cause salmonella. That has since been reduced to one inspector per line, with inidual regulatory waivers enabling line speed increases.“It potentially reduces some of the quality control efforts, but I am not concerned about worker safety as a result of the increased line speeds. Some plants are actually reducing speeds because of employee absenteeism,” said Adam Speck, a senior commodity analyst at IHS Markit’s Agribusiness Intelligence.Campaigners have filed a petition with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), demanding that it declare certain types of salmonella in meat products adulterants (meaning producers have an obligation to withhold contaminated batches), because they “constitute an imminent threat to public health necessitating prompt agency action”.“We’ve been playing around with these standards for 20 years now,” said Corbo, one of the parties to the petition, “and it doesn’t seem to be working in terms of reducing the amount of food-borne illness in this country. People are getting sick from our poultry production system, and we think that is a public health emergency.”In 2011, when the FSIS set a target to reduce food-borne illness, the incidence level for salmonella was estimated at around 16.4 people per 100,000. The FSIS’s plan aimed to reduce that number to 11.4 by this year, but instead, after a small decline over five years, it has now risen to 18.3, according to a CDC spokesperson.A spokesperson for the Chicken Council disagreed with criticisms of the sector. He told the : “No one wants to reduce salmonella more than the companies producing our food. Our families eat the same chicken.” The council opposes the petition, he stated. “We agree with FSIS, and previous court rulings, that a science-based, multitiered approach aimed at reducing all salmonella on raw meat and poultry products results in a more appropriate and effective use of agency resources compared to a separate and specific focus on specific inidual strains.”Campaigners say the FSIS is limited in its ability to keep US meat and poultry healthy. A critical report on the FSIS by the US Government Accountability Office in 2018 stated that a review of data had shown that “some plants are still not meeting pathogen standards – in some cases repeatedly not meeting the standards – and are allowed to operate”. It also pointed out that the agency still had no mandatory recall authority."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43268aa639add177fad9bdc6f7b6c4f1d75ea88/873_0_6693_4022/master/6693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf4be08f3bed4324806213d3e302c1c6","title":"shall i compare thee to my old jumper stories of love for old clothes","story":"Lockdown is a great time to rediscover pieces already in your wardrobe. To mark Fashion Revolution Week, we celebrate tales of long-lasting love for favourite itemsLockdown is a great time to rediscover pieces already in your wardrobe. To mark Fashion Revolution Week, the organisation, who are focused on creating an ethical and sustainable way forward for fashion, are exploring new models of behaviour for clothes lovers across the globe. At the start of this special week we celebrate 10 tales of long-lasting love for favourite items.My name is Nikki and I’m an addict. A vintage clothing addict. Asking me to write a love story to just one garment is like asking me to pick my favourite child. I have an awful lot of clothes and I love them all.During the coronavirus lockdown my massive vintage wardrobe has been a source of endless comfort and joy. I’ve been able to play, guilt free, in my dressing room to my heart’s content and a couple of nights a week my partner and I “dress for dinner”. Even if dinner is only a bowl of pasta we don our finest threads and make it a special event.I’ve picked this late 1950s red taffeta cocktail frock by Suzy Perette for its sheer joie de vivre. Suzy Perette had a licence to make copies of Christian Dior designs in the US in the 50s and I have several examples in my collection. All are impeccably made and although they are about the same age as me the dresses are still as good as new. This dress is always ready for a party.Clothes can have such a dramatic effect on mood and dressing up definitely makes me feel happier. I particularly love vintage clothes of the 40s and 50s for their quality, iniduality and enduring charm.A sari for me isn’t just symbolic of my Bangladeshi culture. It’s also a historic emblem of sustainability through fashion. Saris are simply extended pieces of material you adorn your body with, in a myriad of ways. It can be born when washing the dishes, going for a walk or to your own wedding. They’re timeless and generous in the stories they lend.One of my favourite saris is this red and green georgette number. I’ve worn it to a Mehndi ceremony and also when visiting Bangladesh recently. When I bought it, for £25 in Green Street, I knew we would be friends for a while. This sari will be shared, so my nieces and children, inshallah, will also wear it. Just like other parts of my culture, it’s a tribute to all those women in Bangladesh and their skills in making something beautiful and made to last.In 1990 I found myself, at the age of 30, in a job that required “professional office wear”. This wasn’t really my thing so I found it hard to find items that I found acceptable and also fitted the requirement.I shared my dilemma with my mum who was a hugely talented dressmaker – and 30 years later I still have, and wear, the beautiful tailored blazer that she made me.The jacket is a classic navy made from wool suiting and is fully lined, with two patch pockets, two buttons and a flourish of contrasting piping hidden on the inside where the lining meets the fabric. Very Paul Smithesque.Mum died in 2017, but she lives on not only in the memories the family have, but also the clothes she made.At the risk of sounding like a hopeless romantic, it seemed perfect for my item to be what I wore when I married the love of my life. I wanted my wedding dress to be unique, hold a story and be representative of my home country – which is why my dress is designed and handmade in the Philippines by my mum’s school friend, Therese Andaya.Working on the dress together was so intimate, with countless messages and phone calls across the sea, so when I finally met Therese in real life it was like meeting an old friend.I wanted a simple dress, not just because I prefer a minimal aesthetic, but also because – and this seems unorthodox for a wedding dress – I wanted to wear something beautiful over and over again.This is a shaggy jumper story of two identical knits. When I was a child my mum knitted a signal red wool jumper for her younger sister. My aunt wore it through the 1960s as a young teacher in Cardiff and Canada then passed it on to me when I was at art college in the late 70s. I loved it and wore it constantly in my freezing studio in Brighton. But after darning the elbows and cuffs it eventually fell apart and was consigned to the compost heap.A couple of years ago I found a bundle of gorgeous red yarn which glows cherry pink in the sun in an Aberystwyth charity shop. Mum, at 80, still had the pattern and immediately started knitting a replacement.My daughter has become quite attached to this new sweater, wearing it every day in the run-up to the last election and now on Zoom calls while working at home during lockdown.These challenging and uncertain times remind us the importance of justice, empathy, wellbeing and love. We need to rebuild the fashion system by using social, natural and creative resources constructively.This custom-made silk shirt I am wearing is from the 1970s. I inherited it from my father and have been cherishing it ever since. The silk Gucci scarf was a gift from my mother-in-law who had treasured this iconic piece in her wardrobe since the 1970s. Last but not least, I keep on proudly using and loving these jeans that I purchased back in 2002. These are some of my empowering pieces that remind me of my values and that inspire me to work harder in order to help the fashion system become more sustainable. As a child, I was either naked or in a swimming costume. My parents were not keen on kidswear bikinis, so when I was gifted this one, aged seven, on a camping trip in the Scilly Isles, Scotland, by a lady it no longer fitted, I was ecstatic. I have been wearing it ever since.In 1998, the bikini travelled to Nevis, the Caribbean. Despite my mother saying it was ballooning and did not fit, I remember swimming in the warm sea with my friends and jumping off a fallen palm tree.I’ve grown up in and with this bikini. I played in it as a child, chatted with friends in the mountains wearing it and romanced on the beach. Wearing it now, I’ve pondered existential questions and accepted that stretch marks are here to stay. It’s joined me for a beachside dance and a chance holiday romance.I am happy to say that today, over 20 years on, it’s still a good friend and that my clothing love story has not reached the end.I don’t think about my work overalls when I put them on. I don’t think about how they make me feel or the fabric or the fit. That’s simply because they are an extension of me. I’m not trying to prove anything when I put them on, there’s absolutely nothing aspirational about them. They just signal “work, now”.Trying to work without them just feels wrong. I took all three pairs home for a wash recently, and felt at a loss at the studio the next day without them, barely getting a single thing done. I can only conclude that the overalls are integral to my mindset and work.When my son, Roman, was born, my mother-in-law gave me a bundle of beautiful hand-me-down baby clothes, all lovingly handcrafted by her mother. The clothes had been worn by my husband and his sisters in the mid-1980s.I’m particularly fond of this little waistcoat which is now a staple in Roman’s spring wardrobe. Not only is it beautifully made, it is also reversible with a blue paisley pattern on one side and red flowers on the other.It has been so special to dress Roman in these clothes as he is growing, knowing that they were worn by his dad and aunties and have stood the test of time. Now his aunty Lily is taking the baton during isolation and has made Roman some fabulous yellow plaid trousers to add to the archive. Who knows, maybe Roman’s children will wear them one day.This is my love story for a map dress which I have worn hundreds of times. Here it is, refreshed and ready for another day on my body.When I first bought it, I kept it exclusively for the evening, wearing it with my grandmother’s pearl necklace and monster heels. Many times after wild nights out (or in) I woke up still in it.After a few years it graduated from evening to daytime wear – but still for special occasions only. However, I always knew that I wanted to wear it as a nightie  Sunday slouch, so I have been waiting for some kind of tear, or an indelible stain to appear.But it’s so well made, so easy to care for (a quick steam under the shower and a lick of sponge and it’s all new again) that zero damage has occurred. And so now, in the midst of lockdown, I wait no more, self permission granted, and I wear it every day – my trusted friend, my second skin, my clothing hero.Share your own Clothing Love Story here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f1b4ba928f48984f09a803a242ece9bf16a0abd/0_412_3896_2337/master/3896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c62623577dcc3c6df4536f021088b62","title":"beastie boys story review spike jonze apple tv","story":"Ad-Rock and Mike D host a convivial trip down memory lane in this filmed record of a live show staged in tribute to third member Adam YauchThe release of this documentary coincides with #MeAt20, a heart-twisting craze on social media for posting pictures of yourself at 20 years old. Middle-aged people’s timelines are speckled with funny, sweet and sometimes unbearably sad images of themselves in unlined, unformed youth, doing goofy things in milky analogue pictures from back when you had 12 or 24 exposures on your roll-film camera and getting them developed at Boots was a pricey business. That’s what I thought of while watching this engaging, oddly moving film from Spike Jonze: a record of the live stage show he devised at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, in tribute to white hip-hop stars and tongue-in-cheek party-libertarian activists the Beastie Boys. It is presented by the two surviving members, Adam Horowitz and Michael Diamond, in tribute to the third member, Adam Yauch, who died of cancer in 2012. Jonze is reuniting with the band after having directed a string of their music videos, including the crime-TV spoof for their single Sabotage in 1994.Horowitz and Diamond amble on stage, apparently dressed head-to-toe in Gap, and appear for all the world to be about to unveil the iPhone 4S, although actually their jokey anecdotalism makes the show in some ways like the regional tours once presented by George Best and Rodney Marsh. With amiably rehearsed back-and-forth banter, they introduce the embarrassing photos and excruciating TV clips that are shown on a big screen. And the effect of seeing them juxtaposed with the plump-faced frizzy-haired imps of 1986 is startling and bizarre. In the present day, the advancing years seem to have boiled away the badass attitude, leaving behind the quirky humour.They started out in their teens as post-punk enthusiasts for the Clash, and the photos of them at this stage are starkly black-and-white. But then the archive images turn into the garish colour of MTV. The Beastie Boys got very excited by rap, were picked up for management by the (now notorious) Russell Simmons, brother of Run DMC’s Reverend Run, and soon they were opening for Madonna. In 1986, their album Licensed to Ill happened, along with its fascinating and deplorable and horribly brilliant single (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!) – an anthem for blearily defiant Reagan-years hedonism. I remember hearing it around the time I read PJ O’Rourke’s Republican Party Reptile.The Beastie Boys sold truckloads of records all over the world, and their puppyishly zany image co-existed with limitlessly energetic anarchy. They were, as they fondly recall, expected to be very dangerous on their foreign tours: particularly the British tour. Surreally, a full page of the Sun is flashed up on stage, and the band appear next to a giant picture of former Tory education secretary Kenneth Baker.The band’s live show featured a giant penis emerging from a box. Horowitz and Diamond explain they were intending to satirise the frat-boy image and it took over – though they have the grace to say that they didn’t really care at the time about an alleged misunderstanding that was making them globally famous and rich. However, they also appear genuinely mortified at the fact that, in the early days, they fired the only woman in their original lineup: Kate Schellenbach (now the TV producer of The Late Late Show with James Corden). They repudiate their early reputation for sexism, but nobody in the film mentions these lyrics from the early single Paul Revere: “I did it like this  I did it like that  I did it with a whiffle ball bat.”Inevitably, the Beasties spiralled financially over the top, relocating to LA where they rented a gigantic house featuring a swimming pool with a bridge over it, and went broke. Their accountant phoned to announce this event and heartlessly signed off with: “I’ve gotta go I’ve got Donny Osmond on the other line.” A relocation back to New York, a chastened existence playing smaller clubs, and continued musical experimentation proved to be their path back up to the big league, and Yauch became a campaigner for Tibet. This film is a time capsule of the 1980s: an era that was crass and excessive in so many ways, but now seems weirdly exotic.•Beastie Boys Story is available on Apple TV+ from 24 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fca5c874001a0b6dde32ba30a9407add6dae31df/0_33_1366_819/master/1366.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e092fb194b6dd869a1137ed2404494fd","title":"nigel slater easy egg recipes souffle tagliatelle cheese croissants","story":"Asparagus souffle, mushroom tagliatelle, baked cheese croissants, apricot and lemon curd cake – seven delicious recipes that are as good as goldI long to break into the freckled shell of a boiled egg and lift its snow white and deep orange heart with a teaspoon. I even find myself gazing at a fluffy omelette, its baveuse interior oozing out as the fork goes in. But alas, there is no cheque large enough to tempt me to eat an egg. Whether boiled, scrambled, poached or fried, the egg has always been my culinary bête noir. I like my oeufs well and truly hidden. Custard, cake, meringue or mayonnaise are among my favourite things to eat, as is a souffle, a creme caramel or a mousse, but the egg must always be in total disguise. I have been like this all my life and I reluctantly admit that, at this age, my aversion is unlikely to change.But I don’t write this column for myself, I write it for you and, let’s be honest, most sensible people do find the egg one of the most indispensable ingredients in the kitchen. So eggs it is, cheap and as cheerful as a sunny spring morning. In the recipes that follow there are crisp golden croissants cooked in the style of eggy bread eggs briefly baked with pink prawns and scarlet chillies, there are egg whites in a souffle and yolks in a peppercorn-spiked mayonnaise. I have also made a tender loaf cake with dried apricots and homemade lemon curd, and a garlic-flecked tangle of tagliatelle. Who knows, I may eat that boiled egg yet.A simple dish of baked eggs with shellfish and aromatics. You can use prawns, tiny beige brown shrimps or crayfish tails here. This is a quick supper so I would probably buy them ready shelled rather than shell my own. Use Italian basil if the deliciously aniseedy Thai variety proves evasive. And I would bring some bread to the table too, a crusty baguette to tear apart and dip into the softly quivering egg.Serves 2spring onions 2red chilli 2 largeThai basil leaves 10shelled crayfish tails or prawns 150geggs 4groundnut oil 2 tbspnori flakes 2 tsptoasted sesame seeds 1 tbspSet the oven to 230C fangas mark 8. Roughly chop the spring onions. (I like to cut them diagonally into 2cm lengths.) Chop the chilli similarly.Put the basil leaves and the crayfish tails or prawns into a medium-sized baking dish. Break the eggs into the dish, then scatter the onion and chilli over the top. Trickle the oil over and season with salt and black pepper.Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven until the eggs have just set. Scatter the nori flakes and toasted sesame seeds over.Late last Sunday morning, I brought to the table a batch of croissants cooked in the style of pain perdu, but stuffed with dark curls of speck and pools of melted fontina. Deliciously crisp and brown, the cheese formed pizza-style strings and they disappeared in minutes. Other cheeses will work here, but a semi-hard, easy to grate cheese is best.Makes 4eggs 6grain mustard 1 tbspmilk 100mlcroissants 4 large fontina 150gspeck or other air-dried ham 8 thin slicesSet the oven at 200C fangas mark 6.Break the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk them lightly to combine yolks and whites. Stir in the mustard and 100ml of the milk.Using a breadknife, cut the croissants in half horizontally then dunk them in the egg and milk, pushing them down so they are thoroughly soaked. Lay the bottom halves of each croissant side by side in a baking dish or roasting tin.Grate the fontina. Divide the speck between the croissants, tearing it as necessary, then sprinkle 25g of cheese over each of the ham-covered halves. Place the top halves back in place on each croissant, then scatter over any remaining cheese.Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes till the cheese has melted.I have always enjoyed making mayonnaise, except for the rare occasion when it fails (normally on very humid or thundery days). The speed at which you add the oil really does make all the difference. I start with a few, large single drops, increasing the flow to never more than a mere trickle. Adding too much oil in one go will almost always result in a curdled mayonnaise.The green peppercorns you need are the soft, dark green variety sold in little jars of brine. I like the brief bursts of heat you get from adding them whole, but you could crush them using a pestle and mortar for a more even, gradual heat. If you don’t have any peppercorns in the cupboard, keep the recipe for another time.For the mayonnaiseegg yolks 3dijon mustard 2 tspcider vinegar 1 tspgroundnut oil 100mlolive oil 50mlgreen peppercorns in brine 1 tspdill 10gFor the saladwhite chicory 2 headsred chicory 2 small headsparsley a small bunchdill a few sprigsFor the mayonnaise, put the egg yolks in a mixing bowl with the mustard and cider vinegar. Mix thoroughly, then slowly add the oils, a drop at time, whisking continuously with a large balloon whisk accelerating to a steady stream as the mayonnaise starts to thicken.Drain the green peppercorns of their brine but don’t rinse them, add them to the mayonnaise. Finely chop the dill, stir into the mayonnaise, cover and refrigerate.Separate the chicory leaves and wash in cold running water. Dry them in a salad spinner or on a tea towel, then put them in a large serving bowl. Tear the parsley leaves and dill fronds from the stems and add them to the chicory. Pour over the mayonnaise dressing and toss gently to coat the leaves.Place 2 smoked trout fillets on each plate, sprinkle a little cider vinegar over the fillets, then place some of the chicory mayonnaise at their side.A hint of springtime here with tiny mushrooms and a faint breath of aniseed. As you twirl the tagliatelle round your fork, the egg yolk is very lightly cooked by the residual heat of the freshly drained pasta. (That said, this isn’t a recipe for anyone who wants to avoid raw egg.) Chervil, which I find from time to time at the greengrocer, adds a light aniseed note to this tangle of pasta and parmesan. It is isn’t the easiest herb to get hold of, and if you can’t find its delicate lace-like leaves you could use tarragon.Bring a deep pan of water to the boil and salt generously.Cut the mushrooms into quarters or in thick slices, as you wish. Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan over a moderate heat, add the mushrooms and let them cook, with the occasional stir or shake, for 8-10 minutes till golden and starting to crisp.Chop the black garlic and add to the mushrooms then turn off the heat. The garlic will cook in the residual heat.Cook the tagliatelle in the boiling water for 8 or 9 minutes till al dente, then drain and immediately toss with the mushrooms, garlic and chopped parsley. Add the chervil leaves then ide between two plates or pasta bowls. Break the eggs and separate the white and yolks (you only need the yolks). Add a yolk to the middle of each dish then grate the parmesan over. Stir the egg yolk and cheese into the pasta as you eat.I look forward to the arrival of the first locally grown asparagus in spring with the same excitement I do the first gooseberries of summer, or the damsons of early autumn. It is the clearest of seasonal markers, the first true sign that spring is well and truly here. And yes, it does seem to appear earlier with each passing year and I have no problem with that. You could make an asparagus souffle by boiling and pureeing the tips and folding them in with the egg whites, but that would be to lose much of the elegance of the spears themselves. I prefer to cook the souffle in a shallow baking dish with the spears peeping through the cheesy clouds.Serves 2-3To prepare the dishbutter a knobparmesan 2 tbsp, finely gratedasparagus 12 spearsFor the soufflemilk 300mlbay leaf 1onion 1 small, peeledtarragon 15g, leaves picked and choppedbutter 55gflour 50geggs 4 large, separatedstrongly flavoured, firm cheese such as yarg, gruyere or cheddar 125g, grated or cut into small piecesparmesan 3tbsp, gratedLightly butter the inside of a baking dish measuring about 28cm x 22cm, then scatter in the 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan, tipping the dish from side to side to make sure the cheese sticks to the butter.Cook the asparagus in boiling water for 8 minutes then drain on kitchen paper. Set the oven at 200C fangas mark 6. Bring the milk to the boil in a small pan together with the bay leaf and onion. Turn off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes. Melt the butter in a small, heavy-based saucepan, stir in the flour and leave over the heat for two or three minutes, stirring almost continuously. (You can chuck the bay and onion at this point – they have done their work.) Stir in the warm milk, gradually at first, then a little faster, till you have a thick sauce. Let it come to an enthusiastic bubble, then lower the heat and let the mixture simmer for at least 5 minutes, stirring regularly, until it is thick and smooth. If your sauce looks lumpy, then whisk fiercely until it is smooth and thick. Remove from the heat, cool briefly, then stir or whisk in the egg yolks, one at a time. Work quickly, otherwise the egg will cook before it gets stirred in.Stir the grated cheese and chopped tarragon into the sauce. In a large bowl, using a large balloon whisk beat the egg whites till stiff and frothy. Fold them gently but firmly into the cheese sauce, then immediately scrape into the buttered dish.Place the spears of asparagus on top of the cheese sauce, then scatter the grated parmesan over. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes till puffed and golden.As I took this still warm cake from the oven, the scent of citrus and butter wafted up, reminding me of why I bake rather than buy. There are three elements here: the apricot sponge itself the lemon curd and the crumble that crowns the cake. This is not a recipe to hurry. Instead, a piece of baking to take your time over, an hour or two of quiet hands-on time in the kitchen, perhaps with the radio on and no distractions. The finished cake will keep for several days in a cake tin. We ate it as both tea-time treat (with a pot of fresh mint tea) and as dessert, with a spoonful of thick yogurt nudging against the crumble crust. The recipe makes slightly more lemon curd than you need, but it will keep for a week in a stoppered jar in the fridge. A truly splendid thing when spread thickly on hot, toasted muffins.Serves 8For the lemon curdunwaxed lemons 4caster sugar 200gbutter 100geggs 3egg yolk 1For the cakebutter 125gcaster sugar 125gself-raising flour 75gground almonds 75geggs 3 mediumsoft dried apricots 75gicing sugar for dustingFor the crumblebutter 80gplain flour 110gdemerara sugar 3 tbspicing sugar 2 tbspYou will need a 20cm x 10cm x 7cm rectangular loaf tin lined with baking parchment.Make the lemon curd: finely grate the lemons, then squeeze their juice. Put the lemon zest and juice, the sugar and the butter, cut into cubes, into a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, making sure that the bottom of the basin doesn’t touch the water. Stir with a whisk from time to time until the butter has melted.Mix the eggs and egg yolk lightly with a fork, then stir into the lemon mixture. Let the curd cook, stirring regularly, for about 10 minutes, until it is thick and custard-like. It should feel heavy on the whisk. Remove from the heat and stir occasionally as it cools.Make the cake: cream the butter and caster sugar together until light and fluffy. This is best done using a food mixer. Stir together the flour and ground almonds. Break the eggs into a bowl and beat with a fork or small whisk. Chop the apricots finely using a food processor.While the butter and sugar are creaming together, make the crumble. Rub the 80g of butter, in small pieces, into the flour, then stir in the demerara sugar and set aside. Set the oven at 180C fangas mark 4. Line the cake tin.Add the beaten egg, a little at a time, to the creamed butter and caster sugar. If the mixture starts to curdle, then add a few tablespoons of the flour to bring it together. Mix in the flour and chopped apricots.Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf tin and smooth the surface. Spoon in 250g of the lemon curd and smooth the surface. Trickle a teaspoon or two of cold water over the crumble mix and shake the dish so the crumbs form a mixture of fine and coarse lumps. It makes for a more interestingly textured crumble. Tip the crumble over the lemon curd then bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until lightly firm.Remove the cake from the oven and set aside to rest until almost cool. Remove the cake from the tin, peel away the parchment, dust the cake with icing sugar and serve.For the praline creamshelled pistachios 75gcaster sugar 150gdouble cream 250mldried rose petals a handfulPut a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Break the chocolate into small pieces, and let it melt in the bowl without stirring. Remove from the heat as soon as the chocolate is liquid, add the butter in small pieces and stir, very briefly, then add the hot coffee, stirring gently.Separate the eggs and beat the whites until they are almost stiff. Stir the egg yolks into the melted chocolate then fold the whites in, making sure there are no lumps of unincorporated egg white.Put the bowl in the fridge, covered, and leave for at least four hours to set.Shortly before you wish to eat, make the praline: put the pistachios and sugar into a large, shallow pan over a low to moderate heat. Let the sugar melt and turn a dark amber. Try to avoid stirring and instead, move the pan left and right, encouraging the caramel to melt evenly.When the sugar has all melted and you have rich, mid-brown caramel, pour onto a lightly oiled baking sheet and leave to set.Break the praline into pieces and reduce to coarse crumbs in a food processor, or by crushing and shattering with a rolling pin. Lightly whip the cream until it is almost stiff then fold in most of the crushed praline.Spoon large scoops of mousse onto plates, then add an almost equal amount of praline cream to each.

Until then, I will make them at home.Why has it taken me so long to make piadine? Why has it taken me so long to discover the basic pleasure of making a child-like dough of flour, bicarbonate of soda, water and olive oil, to roll it into plate-sized circles, prick them all over with a fork, cook them in a hot pan until they take on leopardprint to rival that of Bet Lynch, then fold them around soft cheese, salty ham and some of the rocket we should be rationing for the tortoise.Like focaccia, piadine have ancient roots and probably take their name from the Latin plàdena o plàtena. Traditionally, they were cooked on a testo, an absolutely flat terracotta plate that was warmed in wood ovens until hot enough to cook the rounds of dough. The evolution of wood-fired and gas cookers meant a terracotta testo could be heated directly on the stovetop, and the evolution of cooking utensils in the 1970s meant it could be made from cast iron and aluminium, which became common. The first flat I rented in Rome had a testo, not that I knew what it was at the time. To my ignorant eyes, it looked like a large aluminium ping-pong bat with a bulbous wooden handle that was slightly too long for the cupboard, so pushed it open slightly. Useless and annoying, I thought: more fool me.The key to piadine is eating them while they are really hot. This means gathering everyone around and having all the fillings ready: slices of salami, prosciutto or ham, soft cheeses such as stracchino, gorgonzola or cream cheese, also some greens, such as rocket or watercress. As soon as your piadina comes out of the pan, fill and spread one half, then fold the other half over. Eat immediately, ideally with a cold beer or glass of lip-staining dry lambrusco.500g plain flour125g lard or 80g olive oil1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda15g salt180g waterTo serveSalami, prosciutto, ham, soft cheeses (stracchino, gorgonzola or cream cheese) and, if you wish, greens such as rocket or watercress.If you are using lard, use your fingertips to rub it into the flour until the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the salt, bicarb, water and, if you are using it instead of lard, the olive oil, and bring everything into a consistent dough. Wrap in a cloth and leave to rest for an hour.Cut into six pieces and then, one by one, roll them into thin (1-2mm) plate-sized discs (about 22cm in width). Use a fork to prick the discs all over.Warm a nonstick pan until it is hot. Cook the discs one by one, giving them about two minutes a side and turning them continually, so they cook evenly. You want them to acquire leopard-like spots. Serve while still hot, folded around prosciutto andor cheese.

The 2019-20 campaign for the lower three tiers has already been abandoned and the Premiership is heading for the same outcome upon receipt of Uefa approval.The SPFL has been anxious to be in position to start its new season on the first weekend in August as per details of a new broadcasting deal with Sky Sports, worth a record £160m, and season tickets for the 2020-21 season are already widely on sale. The Scottish Football Association even hopes to open a new campaign with its cup semi-finals, which would ordinarily attract an aggregate of at least 80,000 spectators.Both options are now seriously remote, with Nicola Sturgeon also suggesting matches with no spectators would not be viable unless there is a major coronavirus breakthrough. “In terms of playing behind closed doors, clearly there are issues there in terms of, does that completely take away the risk of big events?” the first minister said.“If a match is being played behind closed doors but it’s still on TV the danger then is people still congregate together in groups to watch that so these things often have to be very carefully considered.”Gregor Smith, Scotland’s interim CMO, said: “I just want to emphasise that point that just the very act of playing behind closed doors doesn’t mean to say we won’t get gatherings of people trying to enjoy sport together.”On the general theme of football’s return, Sturgeon was similarly circumspect. “I would absolutely say that people should not be under the expectation that large-scale mass gatherings will be starting any time soon. We want to get a semblance of normality back into people’s lives for all sorts of reasons as quickly as possible, but we cannot do that in a way that risks a resurgence of this virus and then all of the things we’ve tried to avoid becoming what happens again.“I know that is not good news for people, which is the majority of our population, who have sport as a really important part of their lives and our culture and how we use our leisure time but it would be wrong for me to give false expectations right now about an early resumption of football matches or rugby matches or large-scale sporting events like that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e77ae81a590be757ae7f728466265e6e26dd4b30/171_723_2727_1636/master/2727.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cafc175934a73db30dfeea67bea25a0","title":"mark collected all the emails from when i was at sea","story":"Mark Brewster, 42, and Kärri Brewster-Palts, 34, met at work in 2014. They got engaged before they started officially dating and now live in Estonia with their two-year-old daughter In the summer of 2014, Mark Brewster started a new job at a clothing company in London. “I was on a tour of the office when I met Kärri for a couple of minutes. I thought: ‘Wow, she’s fit!’” Although she left an impression on him, Kärri admits she was too busy to notice Mark. “I was totally focused on work at the time,” she laughs.Over the next few months, the pair met regularly for drinks and became friends. “We were both playing the field on Tinder,” says Mark. “There was an attraction, but I had a strict policy on not dating people I worked with, so it felt like we could be really open with each other.” Kärri had come out of a long-term relationship and wasn’t looking for anything serious. “I was making the most of the dating scene and my independence,” she explains. In spring 2015, she started a new adventure. “I loved sailing, so I decided I was going to take part in the Clipper Round the World yacht race.”Kärri resigned from her job and packed her bags, ready to go back to her home country, Estonia, before she started training. “It was becoming clear that Mark and I would miss each other, and neither of us were sure if we’d see each other again,” she says. Shortly before she left, the two went for a final night out in central London, which ended in a goodnight kiss at Oxford Circus tube station. “It felt right,” says Mark. “Every time we’ve been through that station since, we always kiss in the same spot.”When Kärri was in Estonia, she invited Mark to come to stay. “I didn’t think he would come. Mark has eaten the same breakfast of poached eggs every day since 2008 – he’s not someone who ventures out of his comfort zone,” she jokes. But he couldn’t wait to see her. “I really liked her, so I thought: ‘Why not?’” The trip was derailed when one of Kärri friend’s was hospitalised, but Mark supported her. “I think that was a defining moment for us. He waited for me outside the hospital.”In July that year, Kärri returned to the UK for her training. “I asked whether I should stay with him and he admitted he had a date,” she laughs. Despite this, they met up a few days later, visiting a small town on the south coast together. “We’d been very casual, but for the first time we talked about where it was going,” explains Kärri. “I can’t remember the exact conversation now,” says Mark. “I think it was Kärri who suggested getting married. I just thought: yes! Let’s do it. I knew I had no interest in seeing anyone else. There wasn’t a flicker of doubt.”When Kärri left for her sea trip, being apart was challenging. “One day I was on the tube and I read that a sailor had been killed in a clipper accident,” says Mark. He had to wait until the next stop to refresh the page on his phone. “I was in tears trying to get the wifi working to make sure it wasn’t Kärri.” The couple communicated daily via the satellite device on the boat. “It was meant to be for short messages, but we sent long emails,” admits Kärri. “We had the chance to change our minds, but we never did. Mark collected all the emails when I got home and put them in a book.”They married in London when she returned in 2016 and Kärri got pregnant nine months later. “I was doing a job I loved, but we had to rethink our plans,” she says. After a visit to Estonia, they decided it would be the best place to raise their child.In January 2018, they welcomed their little girl into the family. Now firmly established in Estonia, Mark works as a product manager for a media company, while Kärri works in marketing for a bank. At the moment, the country is in lockdown and the pair are juggling work with childcare. “I think at the start we thought we’d have to drink every day,” laughs Kärri. “Now we’re wondering when it will end.”Despite the challenges, Mark says they are incredibly lucky. “I love that she always makes me think about what I am doing and why. I usually end up realising she’s right, too. She helps me to relax and encourages me to do the things I love.”For Kärri, it is Mark’s accepting nature that makes the relationship work so well. “I never have to apologise for being myself, which makes me feel so safe,” she explains. “I’m able to give more back to the people I love as a result. He makes me the best person I can be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bda588011f85485854b0e386db23d4bd6844ac6/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c886ad586a8a490d4863a7a575d1837","title":"melting marvels the top 10 toasties of all time","story":"Lockdown has made us obsessed with bread, and now it’s time to choose the best fillings for toasted sandwiches – from cheese and ham to Nutella and SnickersA month or two ago, no one would have predicted that toasties would be back in fashion. But that was before lockdown sent us back to our kitchens, and we became obsessed with bread.In theory, at least, you don’t need a machine to make a toastie, just two identical cast-iron frying pans. Heat both so they’re smoking hot, put the sandwich in one, and put the other one on top.But it’s easier with the right equipment. Toastie-makers have been around in some form for about a century, but the iconic brand, the Breville, launched in 1974 in Australia and sold 400,000 units in its first year, which at that time was everybody in the nation, even children. Kidding! Nonetheless, it was extremely popular. To taste one was to want a machine – such an elegant piece of engineering, bread crimped together, any filling – even beans – effortlessly held in place, a dainty scalloped pattern on each triangle.If you’re lucky enough to own a Breville, or one of the many rivals, there are a few rules. You can decide for yourself whether or not to butter the inside, but you have to butter the outside, quite heavily. You want it to turn into a little pie. And no fancy bread. Trish Hilferty, the chef-proprietor of the Canton Arms gastropub in London, learned that lesson a decade ago, when she took the toastie upmarket. “In the beginning,” she recalls, “we tried to get our bakers to make a sandwich loaf to fit, but it didn’t work. It needs to be plastic bread, medium cut so it’ll squish down.”These are the 10 best toasties of all time.The spring onion brings a splash of freshness to an otherwise head-turning furnace of pleasure. “It has to be quite a bitey cheddar,” Hilferty says, though she would use a comté or a Wensleydale on a wild day. She wouldn’t dream of using mozzarella. Some people put tomatoes in, but this is a terrible idea (they get too hot).The Canton’s signature toastie – it used to get through four or five large haggises a week, for 50 toasties. It has almost the right consistency – most meat ends up a bit too dry in a toastie – and where it’s not quite wet enough, that’s what brown sauce is for.Sorry to bang on about cheese, but without it the moisture in the ham absorbs into the bread, and you get quite a dry piece of meat with steamed toast around it. I mean, it’s not as disastrous as it sounds, but it’s not perfect.Do be careful, as the more liquid there is, the hotter it will get, and you can put your mouth out of action for a week if you attack it with too much enthusiasm. I would never put Worcestershire sauce on beans on toast, because it’s an interrupter. The extra crunch and fat of a toastie can take a bit of interruption. This is a great leftover use, as you always think you are going to eat them cold, but never do because they dry out. I would add mustard, but only afterwards, on a mouthful-by-mouthful basis.It sounds a bit unnecessarily fusion – why jalapeno? Why not an olive? – but feta is quite a different cheese proposition it doesn’t melt as such but takes on this exquisite crumbly softness. So you want it for the texture, but the taste is a bit in-your-face on its own, and an olive will just make it saltier. The chilli mixes it up a bit.The vegetarian’s conundrum is that very few vegetables will work raw in a toastie, either going limp (lettuce, peppers), getting too hot and unnatural (tomatoes, cucumbers) or simply being an offence to the tastebuds (avocado). And if you are going to the trouble of cooking a vegetable, that defeats the object, which is simplicity. However, if you have a Turkish corner shop, look for jars of spicy aubergine – it is magnificent in a sandwich (use olive oil rather than butter, though – brush on rather than drizzle).Again, peppers from a jar – don’t even think about roasting and skinning them yourself, or you will end up in salad territory and forget your mission. The anchovies can be any old anchovies, all of which are delicious. I wouldn’t put a sardine in a toastie, though – you need to be able to see what you’re dealing with.Cut the Snickers into half-centimetre slices or it won’t melt enough. Don’t overdo it on the Nutella or it will go everywhere. What am I talking about? It will go everywhere anyway. The problem is mainly conceptual – this is clearly a pudding, yet who eats a sandwich for pudding? Children get past this quite easily, thanks to the marvellous agility of their fresh minds.Mashed bananas on toast are quite a quaint, wartime snack, and great for your stockpile of almost-off bananas. In a toastie, they become something a bit fancier, more like a McDonald’s apple pie that tastes of banana."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18346d3c27abe5f24378dd5d63887b3d47099dba/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7e0ecca850762c001395b38257ad2779 1440w","title":"just not true were too lazy for farm work say frustrated uk applicants","story":"Jobseekers take issue with pay and terms and allege farmers favouring migrant labourBritish applicants for jobs harvesting crops have said farmers have made it virtually impossible for them to secure the work despite a national appeal for a “land army” to save the UK’s fruit and vegetables.Dozens of workers have expressed anger at claims they are too lazy or picky to take the jobs, alleging that farmers are favouring cheap migrant labour.Offers of on-site accommodation in which three or four workers share a caravan were among the most frequent complaints on social media and in emails to the , after reports that thousands of British workers had turned down jobs and Romanians were being flown in to pick salad.Chay Honey, in Bristol, whose work on festivals has disappeared, said the pay and conditions of the farm work were difficult to justify. “I live with my fiance and to live on site would mean I would only have one day a week for friends and family. They also said you can’t use your own vehicle, which makes getting out to the shops difficult. Very quickly the romance of going to work for a farm to help provide food for the nation has become very unattractive,” he said.“It seems it is very much geared up for migrant labour. We are not looking for special treatment, but the whole system needs to have some flexibility and not just have this blanket approach.”Genevieve Black, in south Wales, said she had been unsuccessful in applications for 10 jobs despite being willing to live on site in Kent, Hampshire or Scotland. “The idea that Brits are just too lazy to work on farms is just not true,” she said.She is part of a Facebook group, Jobs for Camper Nomads, which is awash with criticism of the farming industry. One poster suggested that farmers could allow applicants with their own camper vans to live on site. “We are forever being told these are unprecedented times and we are all in it together. UK berry farmers not so much! I am sure with a bit of thought a workable solution can be found.”Alison Harrow, an England Athletics running coach seeking farm work, said she was feeling “really discouraged”. “I’ve applied for 200 jobs and you either get ‘We’ve got enough people now’ or you don’t hear anything back,” she said. “Well, if they have jobs coming up at the end of May or June, why don’t they just allocate those now and just confirm a job?“I get an email from one farm worker recruitment agency saying I have not been shortlisted. How can this be? There seems to be a mismatch between demand for workers and matching workers to farm work.”Nick Marston, the chair of British Summer Fruits, said the business model of fruit farming had been “structured around a non-UK workforce for many years” because UK workers had shunned the work: “Farms are receiving large numbers of applications and I think it would be unfair to say the industry is not accommodating local workforce.”He appealed for patience among the army of would-be-pickers, saying the season had barely started and that there would be surge in job opportunities at the end of May and June.Tom Bradshaw, vice-president of the National Farmers’ Union ,said he could understand why people felt frustrated over the lack of job offers. “In a way, the media publicity has come a bit too soon, because the jobs don’t peak until the end of May and June,” he said.He added that a national website that “would act as a centralised hub for all recruiters” was expected to launch later this week, which would make it easier to match supply to demand.

Today, music to see you through from 20 to 24 April, from Stockhausen’s Lucifer to a Beethoven marathonBrowse our picks from: • week four • week three • week two • week oneThe Royal Stockholm Phil doesn’t often tour to the UK, which makes the cancellation of a trio of concerts later this month in Birmingham, Gateshead and Manchester all the more disappointing. The Konserthuset Play platform offers a digital showcase of the orchestra’s recent outings at home, under both its chief conductor, Sakari Oramo, and others, from Karina Canellakis to Herbert Blomstedt. For an invigorating reminder of what a truly world-class band this is, try Brahms’s Second Symphony conducted by Pablo Heras-Casado. It’s a comparatively clean-shaven reading of the piece – stylish rather than high-Romantic – in which the lower strings are velvety, woodwind solos beguile and the brass provide irresistibly high-shine climaxes. Or for an adventure beyond standard repertory, watch (on Facebook) the “digital soup concert” of piano quartets by two late 19th-century female Swedish composers, recorded by three of the orchestra’s principal string players and pianist Martin Sturfält in early April (and all observing social distancing). Elfrida Andrée’s work is a real discovery – new to me, at least. Its three movements demonstrate a composer absolutely in control of her medium, the musical gestures bold, the textures subtle. The performance is a joy, too: intensely hot-blooded throughout. Flora WillsonIn 2018, the French ensemble Le Balcon embarked on a plan to present all seven works in Stockhausen’s week-long opera cycle, Licht. They began with Donnerstag (Thursday), a staging that came to London last year, just before they embarked on this second instalment in Paris at the Philharmonie, again conducted by Maxime Pascal and directed with stylish economy by Damien Bigourdan. In Stockhausen’s personal mythology, Samstag (Saturday) is Lucifer’s Day, and he is the work’s only solo voice, a bass (sung here by Damien Pass). The other protagonists are instrumental – piano, flute, trombone, percussion – though there is also a chorus of monks in the final scene, Lucifer’s Farewell (which, in this production, is performed not in the concert hall, but in a nearby church). As ever in Licht, the dramaturgy is creaky, the narrative hard to take seriously but as ever in Stockhausen, too, the music is often extraordinary, from the opening Saturday Greeting, in which groups of baleful brass surround the audience, through the solo-piano Lucifer’s Dream, the singing flautist of Lucifer’s Requiem and the orchestral tour de force of Lucifer’s Dance, to the farewell, in which the monks chant a Franciscan text, before smashing coconuts on the steps of the church. Andrew ClementsIf nothing else, the Covid-19 lockdown provides an opportunity to remedy gaps in one’s musical knowledge. This live-streamed Wigmore concert plugged a hole for me. The young Beethoven wrote five string trios between 1794 and 1798 before abandoning the genre in favour of quartets. The string trios are not often played, let alone all in one evening as they were here by the classy Franco-German trio of violinist Daniel Sepec, violist Tabea Zimmermann and cellist Jean-Guihen Queyras. There’s a distinct development in Beethoven’s treatment of the trio format between the multi-movement Op 3 trio and the Op 8 serenade on the one hand, and the more assertive aesthetic of the three trios Op 9 on the other. Best of all is Op 9 no 1 in G, which generates a beguiling back-and-forth response between the players. Yet the trios all constantly prefigure the muscularity of the later Beethoven chamber style at times, and the playing is alert and vigorous throughout. The concert is a bit of a marathon, lasting more than three and a half hours with intervals. But online you can hit the pause button from time to time and give each of these works the attention they deserve. Martin KettleRecommendable versions of Tchaikovsky’s masterpiece are surprisingly hard to find online, but at first sight this production from the 2011 Holland festival, with Mariss Jansons in charge of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Bo Skovhus as Onegin and Krassimira Stoyanova as Tatyana, promises to fit the bill. It was staged by Stefan Herheim at a time when he was very much European opera’s flavour of the month, and it’s well populated with the directorial tropes that have since become rather predictable in his shows. This production flits between present-day Russia and the era of Pushkin’s original poem, stopping off at a number of historic moments in between a Russian bear is among the guests at the Larins’s ball, Lensky turns into Lenin during the second act, while among the dancers in the third-act polonaise are Rasputin, Nicholas II, Soviet cosmonauts and muscle-bound medal-winning Olympians. None of it provides much enlightenment on the opera or its characters, though the score is conducted with wonderful assurance by Jansons and there are some fine vocal performances, even if Skovhus and Stoyanova make a rather too mature central pairing. Andrew ClementsAmsterdam’s Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra has always had an enviable track record when it comes to Richard Strauss, who first conducted them himself in 1897, and was so impressed he eventually dedicated Ein Heldenleben to them. The orchestra’s video archive contains a number of outstanding performances of his work, of which pride of place probably goes to a magisterial account of Also Sprach Zarathustra from 2012, conducted by Mariss Jansons. He brings tremendous fixity of purpose to it, so that a work that can often turn episodic progresses as a single arc of sound that proves overwhelming from the famous sunrise with which it begins to the tonally ambivalent nocturne that brings it to its close. There’s also an excellent Till Eulenspiegel from 2016, conducted by Andris Nelsons, who gets its bittersweet humour spot on, in an interpretation that avoids the usual trap of sprinting through it and maintains absolute textural clarity throughout.

Among them is 90-year-old Margaret Payne, who has set out to climb the equivalent of a Highland mountain by taking repeated trips up and down her stairs, and 91-year-old Welsh farmer Rhythwyn Evans, who is pledging to walk 91 laps around the exterior of his bungalow.Ben, 11, from Lincoln has completed the National Three Peaks Challenge by climbing the equivalent of 3,408 metres – the combined height of Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Scafell Pike – in just over 17 hours on his stairs. He has raised more than £3,000 by going up and down his stairs 1,704 times, according to the BBC.Former Scotland rugby captain Mike Biggar, from Wiltshire, has also set himself a challenge. The 70-year-old, who has used a wheelchair since a car accident in 1992 left him with brain damage, is attempting to walk 100 steps in 30 days, with the help of his bars, to raise money for the NHS. Fifty-nine-year-old Rudo Moyo, who lost his sight to measles at the age of four, is similarly walking 260 laps of his garden in Washington, Tyne and Wear, over 10 days.Appearing on Good Morning Britain with his daughter on Monday morning, Tom Moore described the response to his fundraiser for the NHS as “rather like being in fairyland”. Hannah Ingram-Moore, said: “Our life has changed in the last five days. Every day something extraordinary happens … We simply remain a happy family and utterly humbled by the support of the public.”This weekend saw some of the biggest names in music – from Lady Gaga to the Rolling Stones – perform to millions from their front rooms as part of the The One World: Together at Home concert. But there were also some less known acts attracting huge audiences online.Mark Summers, an Elvis performer, said he was humbled after a live-streamed event on Saturday evening – in which he sang requests from his home in the West Midlands – racked up 75,000 views and raised more than £13,000 for the NHS. People tuned in from as far a field as Dubai and Thailand.Summers sang Elvis classics like Suspicious Minds, Don’t Be Cruel and Always on my Mind, and played a specially recorded message of support from Sir Cliff Richard saying: “The NHS is the greatest, Elvis was the greatest, they go really well together.”Writing on his Facebook page, Summers said he had received messages from people saying they had felt depressed, lonely, and isolated from family, and that the performance had made them feel better. “Elvis’s music is so powerful it brings all age groups together, its fun, it’s moving and so much more,” he said.Meanwhile beef farmer Andrew Sheldon from Draycott in Somerset has been dubbed the Somerset Crooner after sharing videos of himself singing on Facebook. Each song is dedicated to the NHS and frontline workers, and some recordings have had as many as 50,000 views in two hours.“With all this coronavirus and that going on, there’s a lot of lonely people out there, sad people, one thing and the other, and I thought I’d like to lift people’s spirits up a bit,” he told the BBC.Championship football club West Bromwich Albion have donated their stadium for use as a maternity clinic, so that expectant mothers can avoid hospital visits during the coronavirus crisis. The club has started providing free space in the East Stand suites at The Hawthorns stadium to deliver antenatal and postnatal care.Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS trust said three clinics would be held Monday to Friday between 9am and 5pm, and would be staffed by 10 midwives and three support workers.Helen Hurst, director of midwifery at the trust, said: “We wanted to provide an alternative space for women who are having antenatal and postnatal care. Women are slightly anxious about coming to hospital in the current climate so we wanted to find a safe space away from the hospital.”She added: “We are really grateful to the Baggies for providing this space for women during this worrying time.”There has been a mixed response to a suggestion by the actor Idris Elba that the world should take a week of quarantine every year to “remember this time” once the pandemic is over. Elba, who starred in Luther and the Wire, told the Associated Press: “I think that the world should take a week of quarantine every year just to remember this time. Remember each other. I really do. I think it’s … other species use it. It’s called hibernation. But it does remind you that the world doesn’t tick on your time.”Responding to the comment, one Twitter user said: “The world should go to war for a week to remember WW2.”Elba announced last month that he had tested positive for coronavirus but had no symptoms. He attended the Wembley Arena We Day event on 4 March alongside Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, the wife of the Canadian prime minister, who also tested positive for the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e70cebea50acc9ab82989ca1caa26922d91b3f8f/0_43_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f76940d538c58892a04e7fac367e28d","title":"the best in culture under coronavirus lockdown podcast","story":"Three  critics – Ammar Kalia, Laura Snapes and Sian Cain – join Rachel Humphreys with a guide to the best of television, music and books under lockdown.

From the Chequers estate, where he is recovering from coronavirus, Johnson held discussions with the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and his director of communications, Lee Cain, last Friday. During the meeting he let it be known he was deeply concerned about the cost of a second peak to both the economy and people’s health. Cummings is also understood to be on the side of caution while so little is known about the consequences of lifting the lockdown.Matt Hancock, health secretaryHancock has been an active proponent of continued lockdown to try to relieve pressure on the NHS and get the transmission rate as low as possible before easing restrictions. He has been vocal about the government not giving away its lockdown exit strategy as it might lead to people starting to disobey the rules. However, in virtual meetings involving some cabinet ministers he has been coming up against their concerns about the health and social impact of a sharp economic downturn and other consequences of lockdown such as escalating domestic abuse levels.Dominic Raab, foreign secretary, deputising as prime minister Raab is known to be instinctively in favour of a swift end to the lockdown but is also keeping his position close to that of the prime minister. He was leading the government at the time the decision was taken to extend lockdown measures by three weeks to 7 May, and was clear about the risks to the economy and the health of the nation if it was lifted too quickly. When pressed for a timeline, Raab pointed to Johnson’s remark of 19 March, that it would take 12 weeks to “turn the tide” of the virus, saying that was still “broadly the outline”.Alok Sharma, business secretaryOriginally considered to be part of the cabinet’s lockdown hawks, keen to get business back on its feet, Sharma has pivoted towards a more cautious stance, telling more than 1,000 business leaders in a webinar last Friday that he shared the PM’s concerns about a second wave. In his call, hosted by the Confederation of British Industry, he said lifting the lockdown too early could bring further setbacks to business because of a second peak of the illness and said “that’s the worst possible thing you could do”.Gavin Williamson, education secretaryWilliamson is another cabinet member who appears to have rowed back from an initial keenness to end lockdown. He had been described as a lockdown hawk because of his reported concern about the long-term effect that absence from school had on children and was keen to see a phased return to the classroom. However, a government source said the secretary of state totally dismissed suggestions he was part of the hawks group, and in a press conference on Sunday he did not give a date when schools would reopen.Sunak has privately been making the case for as quick an end to the lockdown as possible to limit damage to the economy, viewing it as part of his job to speak up about the financial risks of a lengthy shutdown. Internal Treasury projections about the scale of business bankruptcies, unemployment and the depth of the recession to come have caused worries among cabinet ministers. He hinted at this last week in a No 10 press conference, saying he was “deeply troubled” by the effect on the economy. However, sources close to him have also been keen to stress that his first priority is saving lives and protecting the NHS in line with the government’s overarching message. Gove has been growing increasingly concerned about the economic impact of the lockdown and knock-on consequences for the health of the nation, according to Whitehall sources. He is one of the most outspoken of the four decision-makers in the so-called Quad – along with Raab, Sunak and Hancock – about finding ways to relax restrictions, and is leading a strategic unit in the Cabinet Office to look at ways to get the country moving again. Last week, he was reported by the Sunday Times to have told a meeting of the Quad that he wanted to “run things quite hot” – meaning he would be prepared to lift restrictions as soon as the transmission rate had lowered. One person close to him said they did not recognise the idea of different camps within cabinet and stressed he was supportive of the scientific advice.Liz Truss, international trade secretaryTruss believes that restoring global trade as quickly as possible could be a key way to support the country economically and she would be keen to see lockdown restrictions lifted incrementally sooner rather than later. She is continuing to keep up contact with Singapore, Australia and other G20 countries to hammer home that trade with the UK is vitally important for financial recovery. She is not alone in her views within cabinet, with suggestions that anyone with an “economic department” is naturally aligned with her position."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2be36a91da99ae25df302f0829bf9c88dc13409/346_135_3216_1931/master/3216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=293c27b7e136e52c2244a1b50c087ed1","title":"how things change piers morgan now the voice of the nation","story":"Good Morning Britain host providing public service by gunning for perplexed ministerHow things change, part one. Not so long ago, Radio 4’s Today programme was the government’s “Public Enemy No 1”. A media centre of disinformation that needed to be boycotted – preferably shut down completely – because it couldn’t be trusted to allow ministers to tell the first lie that came into their head without some kind of follow-up question or interruption.Since the coronavirus outbreak, Team Boris has had to reconsider its refusal to send ministers on the programme. Even Classic Dom has had to concede that not talking to one of the country’s main outlets is not a good look during a national emergency and has been reluctantly letting ministers out in the wild from time to time.Not that the wild is particularly wild. More like a safari park, as the presenters are so thrilled ministers are no longer an endangered species that they now frequently forget to challenge them. The government can literally send out someone as hopeless as Thérèse Coffey on Today and be fairly sure it won’t come unstuck.How things change, part two. Before Christmas, Piers Morgan was the bete noire of every bleeding-heart liberal. The gobshite Good Morning Britain presenter who shouted down any remainers complaining about the government’s absence of any credible Brexit plan as unpatriotic remoaners. Just suck it up, losers. OK, so Boris Johnson would rather hide in the fridge than talk to Morgan, but a lot of us must have had days like that.Now, though, Morgan has become the voice of a country that is increasingly angry and confused about the way the government has so badly mismanaged the coronavirus pandemic. The everyman who isn’t afraid to use what power he has to call out bullshit and incompetence for what it is. A kind of national group therapy for all those of us who feel powerless.What he does is not so much interview junior ministers – the government has wisely and determinedly kept all its big guns away from Morgan ITV could clean up with Morgan v Priti Patel on pay-per-view – as harangue and shout at them with all the pent-up fury of someone who doesn’t understand why those in power aren’t more bothered that 1,000 additional people have died in the previous 24 hours. The best that any minister can hope for is to survive the barrage without post-traumatic stress disorder.The luckless Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, was Monday morning’s government sacrificial lamb for the media round. Luckless, because Dowden was never groomed for a cabinet post. He was the perpetual Number Three. A deputy senior prefect at school. The most junior of ministers in government who could barely be trusted to carry a file from one end of Whitehall to the other. A man so dull and ineffective that even his shadow has tried to disown him. That he is now in the cabinet speaks more of the quality of the others than any talents Dowden has so far kept well-hidden.Dowden warmed up with what he hoped would be an easy gig on BBC Breakfast with the nice-but-dim Dan Walker, the sports reporter turned chat show host whose questions generally make Graham Norton sound like Andrew Neil.Instead, he got the much sharper Louise Minchin, who rattled off a whole load of questions on the absent personal protective equipment and the failure of Johnson to bother to turn up to five Cobra meetings, without making the slightest pretence of engaging with the answers. Because she, like us, knew he didn’t have any. “Thank you, Olivia,” she said, concluding the interview. That’s how little impression Dowden had made on her. She couldn’t even remember his name. Or if he identified as a man or a woman.Over on Good Morning Britain, after a few warm-up punches from Susanna Reid – all of which took their toll – Morgan went in for the kill. First he asked how many NHS and care workers had died. “43,” Dowden said confidently.Actually it was 80, said Morgan, illustrating his assertion by holding up a double-page spread from a morning paper that clearly the minister hadn’t been bothered to read.Hell, it was early and it wasn’t like he had a serious job where it was his business to know the news. OK, Morgan continued. How many care home residents had died? “217,” Dowden replied. Er ... how about 7,500? Morgan said incredulously. Dowden looked like he might burst into tears.That was only just for starters though. Dowden was pummelled and kicked with questions on everything from the government’s insistence it had been brilliantly prepared for the pandemic, to its selective use of scientific data and potentially life-threatening decision to allow the Cheltenham festival to go ahead on 16-19 March.Dowden’s mouth merely opened and closed noiselessly. Every time he tried to come up with some half-truth or excuse, Morgan slammed him back on the ropes. We learned nothing, but then Dowden knows nothing. But it was cracking entertainment.Moments later, Dowden went on the Today programme for some light rest and recuperation before getting another going over from Nick Ferrari, another interviewer who doesn’t take prisoners, on LBC radio.By the end, Dowden could barely remember his own name. Before going back to hide under the duvet, he made one last call to No 10. “Never again,” he begged. “Please let me do the 5pm press conference instead. That’s a complete doddle compared to this.” Raab just laughed and put down the phone. Meanwhile, Dowden went on a fruitless search for what was left of his self-worth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba00c9dc1e04a5a031f5b7e5176e3505a9757e40/0_79_5441_3264/master/5441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b93321a113affaa406ba980534bb2fa8","title":"mps expected approve plans virtual parliament","story":"Proposal would allow 120 MPs to take part using Zoom app while another 50 sit in chamberMPs are expected to approve historic plans for a “virtual parliament” when they return to Westminster on Tuesday but the new system will fall short of achieving full digital democracy.The proposals will allow up to 120 out of 650 MPs to take part in proceedings at once using the Zoom video conferencing app, while up to 50 will sit in the Commons in person under strict social distancing rules.Some of the more boorish traditions, such as heckling from the backbenches, will no longer take place because Commons officials will be able to control who is heard.Other parliamentary quirks, such as “bobbing” – when MPs stand up and sit down to attract the Speaker’s attention – would be difficult to replicate, Commons officials said.Screens will be placed around the chamber so ministers and parliamentary staff can see MPs who are taking part in each debate. Signs will indicate where MPs can sit, with tape marks on the floor showing where others can stand.All parties are expected to back the proposals, although few MPs are expected in the chamber for the vote after being actively discouraged by their whips to stay away.Chi Onwurah, the shadow digital minister who first called for a digital parliament to be established last month, said: “I am sure there are going to be hiccups on Wednesday and we have further to go – we should be able to make spontaneous interventions rather than pre-submitted questions.“But it is a huge step forward. We have gone from the 17th century to the 21st century in three weeks.”Chris Bryant, the Labour MP for Rhondda and a former shadow leader of the house, added: “I am glad we can scrutinise ministers but I’m a little anxious about the new system because it is the crowd in the chamber that sometimes forces ministers to explain themselves. Remoteness may take all the energy out of the proceedings.”If the proposals are voted through as expected, they will be used for the first time at Welsh questions on Wednesday morning, just before prime minister’s questions. Labour has not yet said whether Keir Starmer will take part, while Dominic Raab will represent the government in Boris Johnson’s absence.Once the new system has been used, the house will consider whether the model should be extended to debates on motions and legislation. A decision is expected later on whether to move to a system of remote voting.

It is thought that each species mimicked each other’s changes during this period of adaptation.Julia Schwab, a PhD student in the University of Edinburgh’s school of geosciences, who led the study, said: “Sensory organs such as the inner ear are key to understand how ancient animals lived.“We found that marine crocodile relatives have a very unique inner-ear shape, similar to other water-living reptiles and today’s whales.”Experts said the findings also show the crocodiles’ sensory systems evolved in response to their new deep-water environment, rather than driving them into it.Dr Steve Brusatte, also of the school of geosciences and senior author on the study, said: “The ancient aquatic crocs developed unusual inner ears after modifying their skeletons to become better swimmers.“Whales also changed their ears in a similar way, but did it soon after entering the water.“It seems like the crocs and whales took similar but different evolutionary routes from land to water.”The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), was supported by a grant from the Leverhulme Trust.It involved a team of scientists from around the world, including colleagues from the National Museum of Scotland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c095db30a48ce3bdaa6fce5bcb5fbd9dc8b16627/0_62_737_442/master/737.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=35730e0483a25214ccf0d863417455ca","title":"mps investigating commercial property purchases by councils","story":" Public accounts committee inquiry follows fears about exposure to risk amid pandemic Parliament’s spending watchdog has launched an inquiry into purchases of commercial property by local authorities, amid fears that the coronavirus pandemic will expose councils to a drop in income from their investments.The public accounts committee will look into whether local government officials have the commercial skills required for such transactions, which have rocketed over the past four years. MPs will also question officials from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government over how much they monitor commercial activity among local authorities and their exposure to risk.Local authorities have been on a shopping spree in recent years, buying up property such as shopping centres and office buildings as a means of increasing their revenues and to offset the impact of austerity measures introduced in 2010.A recent report from the National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises government spending, found that local authorities spent an estimated £6.6bn on commercial property from 2016-17 to 2018-19, compared with £460m during the preceding three years.The pandemic is expected to create a hole in councils’ budgets due to a huge shortfall in council tax income, along with lost revenues from missed parking and leisure fees during the coronavirus lockdown.Ministers are expected to provide English councils with a £1bn bailout to prevent several of them from collapsing into insolvency due to soaring costs related to the coronavirus crisis, such as for providing extra social care and housing rough sleepers during the lockdown.Even before the government lockdown created uncertainty about local authorities’ income, the NAO report warned of the risks associated with commercial property, which could leave councils badly exposed by a recession or property crash.“Income from commercial property is uncertain over the long term and authorities may be taking on high levels of long-term debt with associated debt costs,” the NAO said.Councils have been able to access low-cost funding from the government’s public works board, but critics argue it has caused them to bid higher amounts for property, and in some cases overpay.Spelthorne council in Surrey, a tiny Conservative-controlled authority, has used these Treasury-backed loans to build a £1bn property portfolio, despite its annual operating budget of £22m. The council said last year that income from commercial property allowed it to offset £2.5m of government grants cuts, and raised more income than council tax.Shropshire council has previously been criticised for spending £51m on three shopping centres in Shrewsbury, all of which had fallen in value by almost a quarter even before the pandemic.However, the council countered that the fall in value was not a major concern and the assets would guarantee some annual income and enable redevelopment, to make Shrewsbury town centre more attractive.A spokesperson for the Local Government Association, which represents English and Welsh councils, said: “Councils have faced a choice of either accepting funding reductions and cutting services – such as care for older and disabled people, protecting children, reducing homelessness, fixing roads and collecting bins – or making investments to try and protect them.”Fears over council’s property investments are being replicated across the continent. The latest analysis from the real estate consultancy Green Street Advisors says that commercial property across Europe will “experience occupancy declines and rent declines in 2020 and 2021”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77e791eec6e74aa433fd4c72dac237287e6e6648/0_0_4000_2402/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d62319705c71c96923783f1661fd7932","title":"larry olubamiwo athletes dope for money my goal was to make a living","story":"The former boxer and Ben Johnson fan banned for doping shares his views while challenging received wisdom on drugs in sport“I have a very pragmatic approach to doping,” Larry Olubamiwo says after he has told me of another sporting great he is convinced used performance-enhancing drugs. “I make it akin to life and the saying that links both is ‘better living through chemistry’. As a society we use drugs to enhance ourselves. We wake up and drink a cup of coffee that has caffeine in it. That’s a drug. People drink alcohol to numb pain or relax. That’s a drug. Nicotine is a drug.“What is the difference between someone using these drugs and an athlete using other drugs to improve themselves? Many athletes dope to make money for themselves and their family. My first goal as a boxer was always to make a living.”The former heavyweight boxer was banned for four years in 2012 after using 13 banned substances including EPO, human growth hormone and steroids. His ban was then reduced to a year after Olubamiwo offered information to UK Anti-Doping.Olubamiwo is kind towards Charlie Francis – Johnson’s denigrated former coach. “I’m a big Charlie Francis fan. Francis believed hormones made naturally in the body – EPO, human growth hormone and testosterone – should be allowed as supplements. Maybe ban the synthetic stuff – anabolic steroids and other drugs. He reasoned that stuff made in the body was safe if taken in reasonable doses.“I’ve always subscribed to his thinking that this would make it a more level playing field. This is one of the main reasons for doping because it’s never equal. One guy has a better coach than another. One guy can afford better equipment and warm-weather training. Sport is never fair.“What’s the difference between creatine and testosterone? It’s hypocrisy to say one thing is OK and the other isn’t. If you allow athletes to use these substances it makes it more equal. For safety, you can test athletes’ health markers and make sure they’re not using more dangerous stuff.”Setting aside moral concerns about legalising EPO, human growth hormone and testosterone, doping increases the danger of boxing. Boxers are maimed and killed in the ring. If power is enhanced artificially even more damage will be caused.“I hear that argument all the time,” Olubamiwo says. “But most boxing deaths happen because of the accumulation of blows. If you’re enhanced, if you have more power, the fight wouldn’t last as long. Your opponent wouldn’t sustain as much damage. If you’re on the receiving end and you’re enhanced, it increases your resilience to punishment. It actually helps fighters both ways.”This seems a spurious argument. No supplement can safeguard the brain when a pulverising blow smashes into a boxer’s head. “It’s not going to safeguard the brain,” Olubamiwo agrees, “but growth hormone can thicken your skull. It can increase the water around the brain inside the skull.”I have heard too many neurosurgeons talk about the damage done to a brain by a heavy blow to believe Olubamiwo’s theory. But, rather than dismiss everything he says, his story offers valuable pointers into a doping mindset. Before he became a boxer Olubamiwo was a promising sprinter who began doping at 19. He plays down his own sprinting prowess. “Dwain Chambers is my age. When I was running 100m in 10.7, he was running 10.1.”Chambers was eventually exposed for doping. “He probably was using then – but so was I. It wasn’t just at the top. It was most athletes trying to get to the top. At first I thought it was just sprinters but then I got friendly with long-distance runners and throwers. Doping’s across the board.”At 20, Olubamiwo turned to boxing. He was even more convinced of the need to dope because “you don’t go into a gun-fight carrying a knife”. Doping was so pervasive that Olubamiwo did not feel any ethical qualms. “I’m not saying everyone is on drugs. But a sizeable amount of people are on drugs. I made the informed decision to use and compete with the best.”Olubamiwo was jailed between the ages of 21 and 26 for armed robbery. He came out of prison and completed his degree and was a day short of 30 when he finally made his pro boxing debut in October 2008. Promoted by Frank Maloney, he won 10 of his first 11 fights.Olubamiwo describes how easy it was to gain a supply of PEDs. “Only EPO is more challenging. It’s not as available as anabolic steroids or growth hormone. It’s a stamina drug, a very niche drug. I got EPO online from a pharmaceutical company in China.”With his scientific knowledge did he consider the side-effects? “Side-effects come with abuse. I always thought that use is when you use it to optimise yourself without compromising your health. Abuse is compromising your health. I did things very safely. If I didn’t have my knowledge, I would have hired someone. I didn’t take huge doses because I’m usually cautious.”Does he have any side-effects now? “Not at all. Healthy as a horse.”Was there more doping in boxing than athletics? “That’s an interesting question. At first I would have said athletes were the biggest users. But going further into boxing I realised it was pretty much the same. It’s just that boxing has been very late to anti-doping.”Olubamiwo was not tested once between October 2008 and January 2012. “That’s what led me to become complacent with my protocol. When I started I was very meticulous about when I came on and off. Wrote down dates. Clearance times. But as I wasn’t being tested, I thought: ‘I don’t have to keep track.’”If he had remained rigorous, Olubamiwo believes he would never have been caught. But his career hit the skids when he lost a controversial decision against Sam Sexton in January 2012. The real controversy, however, soon broke. “I knew the writing was on the wall because there was no way I could flush EPO out my system,” he recalls. “I was tested before the fight.”The US Anti-Doping Agency had tipped off Ukad because it had discovered Olubamiwo’s name while trawling through the records of all those who had ordered EPO from China. Olubamiwo did not fight the charges because he was “sick of the lies”. He harbours no bitterness that he is one of the minority of British boxers who have been caught cheating. His anger towards Ukad stems from the fact that he claims the agency broke a legally binding contract to return his 3,000 pills once he retired.“After I corresponded with them for months, they said they had lost the pills and didn’t offer me any compensation. I asked for £20,000 compensation. Not just because of the value of the pills but because of the value of the information I gave. They wouldn’t have got that information if that contract wasn’t signed. So they got it through false pretences. That’s why I’m livid.”Surely it would be unethical for Ukad to return medication banned in elite sport to a convicted doper? “If they want to look at things ethically, we need to look at things legally. Legally, they weren’t even allowed to take that stuff off of me.“They did it under false pretences by saying: ‘They’re a class A drug blah blah.’ They were perfectly legal to have in my possession. They’ve also broken a contract. We all know legally trumps ethically. I’m already talking with a barrister and taking action. They can’t be seen to get away with this.”Olubamiwo is deeply cynical. “A whole host of shady things are happening with anti-doping organisations around the world. You just think: ‘Woah, what is the point of having anti-doping?’ It seems like you catch people who are scapegoats. The guys who are doing the real doping – and professionally employing people to help them dope – you can’t touch. You have no desire to touch them because you don’t have the money.”Is there still only limited testing of British boxers? “Without a doubt. Ukad have a budget of £8m across all sports. Not just boxing. That’s a drop in the ocean. As much as they talk about anti-doping and how much testing they do, the reality is they can only do so many tests. They target suspicious people instead of doing random testing.”Boxers who fail tests, in turn, still end up being offered lucrative contacts or fights and he names Saul “Canelo” Alvárez, Alexander Povetkin and Lucas Browne. Olubamiwo says Povetkin’s inclusion on numerous British bills, including a world heavyweight title fight against Anthony Joshua in 2018, “beggars belief”, adding: “Povetkin’s been caught twice. Browne’s been caught twice. I mean, come on.”Olubamiwo does not believe anything will change in regard to sport and doping. “Oh no, because money talks. The little guys are scapegoats and the big fish get away with it. That’s how these anti-doping organisations operate. Occasionally they’ll get a big fish, but it’s usually because they’ve pissed off too many people higher up. Lance Armstrong pissed off way too many people. Usually, if you’re a big fish, and you’re not an arsehole, you will get away with it.”It’s a bleak view but Olubamiwo shakes his head when I say I can’t imagine him ever watching sport again. “I’ve always loved sport. I’ll always watch sport regardless. I’ll watch boxing and the Olympics. It doesn’t sour me to sport at all. I just know the truth about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/776549acbde8bfbaa8b0760d5f1acc8acdf9b557/0_286_5383_3230/master/5383.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84b2181b54d48dba4708cb63d201bf2f","title":"with sport frozen in time we need to find joy in the journey not the destination","story":"Even now we are finding it impossible to let go of sport, but maybe it is time to stop hoping for conventional endingsI’ve always been vaguely puzzled by the story of the dinosaurs. Not what happened, but why we tell it, and in particular why we tell it to children at such an early stage in their formation. Let’s just try to picture things from the child’s perspective for a second. First, you lovingly render this idyllic prehistoric landscape. Next, you populate it with all sorts of strange and fantastical characters. Stampeding triceratops. Big, clumsy diplodocus. Sleepy stegosaurus. Squawking pterodactyl. The mighty, ravenous tyrannosaurus rex.Then on the final page, just as the child is beginning to grow an emotional affinity to these beasts, to wonder how they might develop or interact with each other, you destroy the whole planet with a giant meteorite. Entirely without warning, and for no reason at all, every last dinosaur dies: The End. Or worse, the news has to be broken by a sheepish parent as a sort of appalling “Where Are They Now?” epilogue. What lesson, then, is the child supposed to derive from all this? That nothing lasts forever? That everything you hold dear is liable to be incinerated in a giant cosmic fireball at any given moment? Or, conversely, are we to disregard the distressing denouement altogether, and celebrate the fact that these magnificent monsters walked the earth in the first place?These are the sort of questions worth bearing in mind as professional sport embarks on yet another week of enforced stillness: frozen in time, preserved as if an ant in amber. In the Premier League, Manchester United remain tantalisingly on the verge of breaking into the top four. In the Champions League, the last-16 tie between Lyon and Juventus has been beautifully poised for almost two months. Pakistan are still 1-0 up on Bangladesh with one Test to play. Wigan and Castleford continue to be locked at the top of Super League with 10 points each.None of this is over, and yet the competitions to which they belong already feel like vestiges, fossils from another geological time. As sport continues to negotiate the aftermath of its own mass extinction event, a thorny question begins to present itself, one that will loom ever larger the longer this continues. What would it mean for all this to just – end?Of course, some of it has already has. The Belgian league was the first in Europe to bring the curtain down on the 2019-20 season. Scotland may well follow in the coming weeks. But for the most part, the illusion of continuity has been maintained. Even now, merely to advance the idea of abandoning an ongoing competition is to be corona-shamed into submission on social media. But what of promotion and relegation? What of the record books? What of season tickets? What of my £20 bet on Danny Ings for the Golden Boot?For some reason, and for all the evidence of its ultimate irrelevance, we find it impossible to let go of sport. On this point, fans and broadcasters and administrators seem to be pretty much agreed: the show must go on, even if it drags into autumn, into winter, into the jaws of a possible second pandemic. Even if players need to be swabbed, wrenched from their families and marooned on a quarantined island for two months. However long it takes, however demented and obsessive it begins to look: it started, and therefore it must be finished.Why might this be? Naturally, for those with skin in the game there are powerful financial factors at work: all those unfulfilled television contracts, all those unhonoured hospitality bookings. But for the rest of us, there is something more profound going on: the same thirst for closure, the same cognitive bias that tempts you to read a book all the way to the end, even if you’re not remotely enjoying it. As children, we learn that ending a story with the words “and it was all a dream” is the lamest of cop-outs. As adults, the words “and then there was a big virus and everything just finished” feel equally unsatisfying.Yet both art and life offer us numerous examples of the sudden, inscrutable ending: the seemingly random cataclysm that recasts what preceded it in an entirely new light. The Sopranos finale. The absurdist, Biblically themed ending of Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia. The abrupt deus ex machina resolution to The War of the Worlds. Occasionally, sport goes the same way. What can Devon Loch’s slip or Zinedine Zidane’s head-butt or Jean van de Velde’s meltdown at Carnoustie possibly mean?Perhaps nothing. Perhaps it scarcely matters if Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal never meet on a tennis court again. Perhaps it scarcely matters if Simone Biles misses out on Tokyo 2021. Perhaps it scarcely matters if Liverpool’s first league title in 30 years is thwarted not by collapse on the pitch but a deadly virus. Perhaps we seek closure a little too unquestioningly, demand loose ends to be too neatly tied, crave certainty in a world where none can possibly exist.If you can’t find meaning in the ending, then find meaning in the story instead. The sport we love, the sport we were looking forward to, isn’t coming back: not, at any rate, in the form or context in which we envisaged it. Some of the compromises to unfold over the coming months will feel dirty, unjust, wrong. Go with it. Remember that sport in its purest form is its own reward. That sometimes the journey is as important as the destination. And that at its outset, even a life-destroying meteorite first appears in the night sky as the most brilliant light."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5618ed266d001a0063bc417c3513887026557a29/89_170_4643_2786/master/4643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a95b2dc94a5d7ae18d96b9c954697d3","title":"oneplus 8 review 5g and top performance for less","story":"Large 90Hz screen, slick software, speed and strong battery life at a price that undercuts top rivalsOnePlus is back for 2020 with a revamped, lower-cost flagship phone with a slightly smaller 90Hz screen and 5G as standard.The £599 OnePlus 8 slides in under the £799 8 Pro, offering most of what you get on the firm’s top phone but in a smaller, more manageable package.On the outside the OnePlus 8 looks like 2019’s 7T Pro hit with a shrink ray and given a new paint job. Not that the phone is that small. It has a gorgeous 6.55in FHD+ AMOLED screen that is big by most standards, it is just not as massive as the super-sized variety. It runs at a 90Hz refresh rate too, which continues to be an excellent enhancement making all scrolling and animations a lot smoother than the previous 60Hz standard.A selfie camera peers through a hole in the screen in the top left corner. The rest of the device is the usual metal and glass sandwich with curved sides. It has a central triple-camera lump in the back, OnePlus’s excellent alert slider, power and volume buttons in the sides, and a USB-C port in the bottom, but no headphone socket.At 72.9mm wide the OnePlus 8 is one of the narrowest large-screen smartphones available, which with its relatively light 180g weight, makes it significantly easier to handle. For comparison, the OnePlus 7T is 1.5mm wider, Google’s Pixel 4XL is 2.2mm wider, Samsung’s Galaxy S20+ is 0.8mm wider and Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Max is 4.9mm wider.At 160.2mm long and 8mm thick the OnePlus will fit in a pocket fairly easily. A good clear plastic case is included in the box, while a screen protector comes pre-applied.The OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro are some of the first smartphones released in Europe to feature Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 865 processor, available with 8 or 12GB of RAM depending on storage version. It is 5G-capable by default and supports two sim cards at once.Performance all-round was nothing short of fantastic. OnePlus has made a name for itself with some of the fastest-feeling smartphones, and the 8 is no exception. Snappy, fluid, with no hint of lag or latency. It’s simply more responsive than anything else. Gaming performance was top notch too.Top performance is backed by solid battery life. The OnePlus 8 lasts more than 32 hours between charges, which is longer than its predecessor, making it from 7am on day one until 3pm on day two - enough for even the busiest of days.That was after spending three hours on 4G, the rest on wifi. And with the screen set to 90Hz and on for well over five hours for the usual deluge of email, messages and push notifications, 50 minutes of video, plus seven hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones and about 20 photos.One caveat: it was impossible to test the effects of 5G on battery life during lockdown in the UK as I do not currently receive coverage at home. 5G performance on Vodafone and EE, however, was similar to the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra when tested during a grocery run. It’s worth noting that, pending a software update, the phone is limited to 4G-only when two sims are used at the same time.The 8 ships with OxygenOS 10.5 based on Android 10, which continues to be one of the best implementations of Android available on any device.New for this year is the addition of Google’s Discover feed on the home screen, replacing the less-than-loved “Shelf” alternative. Other nice touches include the ability to choose which icons show in the status bar, full theme support, including a dark-mode theme, choices for animations such as that around the fingerprint scanner and the ability to trigger Google Assistant by pressing and holding the power button.Overall OxygenOS continues to provide plenty of customisation and power-user features without clutter or slowdown.OnePlus offers software support for at least three years from release, including two years of Android version updates and then a further year of security updates on a bi-monthly schedule. Updates to new versions of Android are fairly fast post-release by Google too.The OnePlus 8 has a triple-camera system on the rear of the device, combining a 48-megapixel main camera, a 16-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 5-megapixel macro camera.The main 48MP camera shoots 12MP photos by default, producing some great-looking images in good lighting, while the auto-HDR mode handles high-contrast scenes well. It stumbles a bit in middling conditions, such indoor lighting, losing detail in textures and struggling with white balance. Low-light performance is not fantastic, although OnePlus’s Nightscape mode helps. A 48MP mode is also available, but I generally got better results without it.There’s no telephoto camera, which is a shame, instead a 2x zoom button in the camera app is a digital zoom, which works pretty well at low magnifications, but is full of artefacts anywhere approaching its 10x max.The 16MP ultrawide angle camera is fun and does a good job of capturing a wide scene, but was a little bleached and soft on detail in bright light, handling better in less sunny scenes and indoors during the day.The 5MP macro camera is garbage. I take quite a lot of macro photography and got much better results using the main camera, which can focus fairly close to the lens, and then zooming in a little bit.The front-facing 16MP camera is fixed-focus but is really good, producing highly detailed and well toned skin in images in good light. It gets slightly softer in poor light, but still very respectable.The OnePlus 8 is a great phone at a good price, particularly when you consider you’re getting 5G flagship performance at £599, which undercuts rivals such as Samsung’s Galaxy S20 by about £300.You get a smartphone experience that’s second to none. Always fast, always fluid and with a level of software refinement few others manage. The 6.55in 90Hz screen is bright and slick, while the narrow width and relatively light weight make the OnePlus 8 one of the easiest big-screen phones to use on a day-to-day basis.The battery outlasts even the most intense days, while it charges super fast and has modes to help increase battery longevity. The main camera is good for the money too.Corners have been cut to reach the mid-range price, including a telephoto camera and wireless charging. While three years of software support might be fairly standard for Android devices, Samsung offers four and Apple offers at least five, so there’s still work to be done.Overall the OnePlus 8 offers a lot of phone for the money in a manageable size, making it the very best lower-cost 5G device released so far.Cons: no headphone socket, no telephoto camera, 5G disabled when using two sims, no formal IP rating, only three years software updates This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Usually he’d go with a group, but because of social distancing orders, he ventured out alone.Kane and other local residents volunteer to help restore coastal walls and fish ponds, or loko iʻa kuapā, to reintroduce native seaweed and pua (baby fish) into the bay.Resting against the slick black rocks, he looked north toward Sherwood Beach. Usually dotted with local residents, the beach was fuller than Kane expected.“Locals are following the orders, staying home. But there are people, who are clearly tourists, here by the dozens,” said Kane. “They’re still out here, still in groups of seven or more, still coming, and that’s a problem.”Hundreds of travelers, motivated in part by $100 airfares, are still crossing the Pacific to ride out the pandemic in Hawaii. Last week alone, more than 800 non-residents flew there. Meanwhile, locals and some legislators are growing increasingly frustrated. They assume the statewide mandatory self-quarantine order – two weeks for out-of-state visitors and inter-island travelers – isn’t being followed. They also anticipate that disregard by travelers will result in more Covid-positive cases in Hawaii, stressing an already ill-equipped healthcare system.Hawaii just confirmed its 580th Covid-19 case and 10th death. To date, 35 non-residents have tested positive for Covid in Hawaii. On Saturday, Hawaii governor Ige closed all beaches, though water activities are still allowed.For Kane, 34, a Waimanalo neighborhood board member and community representative, he has seen travelers at the grocery stores or gas stations in Kailua or Kaneohe, tourist hotspots and towns with high rates of coronavirus cases. He says he worries for his family and community, many of whom have underlying health conditions – Native Hawaiians and Micronesians suffer disproportionately from poor access to healthcare and chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Almost all of Kane’s family members are still reporting to food-service jobs around the island and several are pregnant.“People will always see this place as their playground. And in this moment, as a Native Hawaiian, this is very reflective of many historical circumstances, where people from outside of the islands have come in and caused real harm to the native population. It’s not always with direct intent to do so, but the impacts, especially on Hawaiian people, are very real,” he said.“If you take our history, it tells us that we are not very well protected.”On Oahu and the outer islands, tensions are high. Protesters have shouted and taken pictures of incoming travelers who have their temperatures taken upon arrival and sign contracts agreeing to adhere to the quarantine order. Outside a Maui airport, some travelers raised their middle fingers as they passed by Bryan Berkowitz, a Maui resident. “It’s beyond frustrating,” said Josh Masslon, a Maui-based ICU nurse. “We cannot handle an outbreak with our resident population alone.”Masslon added that he has called law enforcement several times when he’s seen rental cars parked at beaches with groups of people on the sand.Debates on Facebook and Instagram between incoming travelers and islanders go on daily. Several travelers wrote “See you soon” and “We only care about our opinions.” In late March, one family of four from Illinois was assaulted and the tires on their rental car were slashed in Waikiki.Oahu locals have been relishing in the spectacle of an empty Waikiki. “It’s our Times Square and it’s silent,” said Mollie Bruhl, a resident of Honolulu suburb Kalihi. She’s been venturing to Waikiki to surf almost daily, which is still allowed, but beaches are being patrolled on foot and by drone by law enforcement. Every so often, a voice rings out from the drone: Aloha. The stay-at-home order is in effect. Please do not gather or sit on the beach. Water activities are permitted, but please leave immediately after.In an effort to gauge intentions of non-locals, other residents who’ve been surfing in Waikiki said they’ve talked to travelers out on the water who claimed they were coming to the islands for an extended stay upon arriving at the airport.“People from Hawaii have always had this underlying tension with people coming in,” said Bruhl. “People here see themselves as a collective considering the whole rather than ‘I’. Now we feel like we’re trying to protect ourselves.”On 1 April, Governor Ige established a mandatory two-week self-quarantine for out-of-state visitors and inter-island travelers. Visitors must tell the state where they’re staying and they cannot list vacation rentals as their lodging. Violators face fines or prison time two iniduals on Kauai have been arrested so far. The state also instituted a program that is financing return flights for travelers who arrive without accommodations.The state is supposed to be following up with tourists on their whereabouts, but limited resources make it difficult to keep tabs on thousands of new arrivals. “The only thing we’re doing is notifying the hotels, and hotel staff check,” state Adjutant General Kenneth Hara told a special legislative committee last week. I spoke with eight iniduals who arrived in Hawaii from four US cities in the last week and none have received a follow-up call.The mayors of Honolulu, Kauai and Maui County asked the White House to stop all non-essential travel to Hawaii. Governor Ige rebuked the request, saying it would be up to the airlines and they could not discriminate among essential and non-essential passengers.“I don’t believe it’s a situation where the majority of those who are ordered to quarantine are not obeying,” Ige said. “But we are continuing to look at improving the system as we go.”Other representatives have called for stricter responses, similar to that of New Zealand, while hundreds of residents signed a petition demanding shuttered hotels be used to isolate all travelers.Kane has been volunteering with organizations and local chefs to help source and deliver products and meals to multi-family homes and the elderly in Waimānalo.“The state has failed to protect many, in the people’s eyes, locally,” said Kane. “It took too long to mandate closures, and the communities that would be hardest hit weren’t taken into consideration.”He expects little change from the state as he looks ahead to when the islands open up again, and the number of non-residents arriving daily could surpass 30,000.Every few days, he ventures back to the fish pond on Waimanalo Bay alone. There, he’s reminded that change and survival is its own tradition among his communities. This moment in particular rings of how change can be total and inconclusive and instantaneous.“But we’re living this one together, like always,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c7f371147e3b3ed125b284f6d2d9aaeaf35dc2/0_80_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cceb427e0e30f92fff3b71f40fd99193","title":"covid lockdown opening up world for people with disabilities","story":"Many people able to take part in work, culture, or socialising from their own home for first timeWhile the coronavirus pandemic has led to unprecedented restrictions for billions of people, for many with disabilities, the lockdown has paradoxically opened up the world. As society embraces “virtual” living, disabled people – who for years have missed out due to poor access – are suddenly finding themselves able to take part in work, culture, or socialising from their own home.Nicola Welsh, 43, has always loved going to museums but a painful nerve condition means she’s been housebound for 17 years. As cultural institutions including the National Theatre and the Royal Opera House go online, she’s been able to tour the world visiting museums.Brian Spalding, 47, who has been on bed rest for four years with spina bifida, can now socialise with his friends online. “Since lockdown I have actually felt better about my situation, given all of society now experiencing a form of ‘bed rest’,” he said. Spalding, who lives in Argyll, Scotland, is even giving advice to loved ones on how to cope with isolation when they feel anxious or stressed. “I’m finding my community, for so long seeming so much further away, is now literally so much closer to home.”For others, lockdown has seen career doors open. Laura Elliott, in Sheffield – who has hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which affects connective tissue, and ME – has always wanted to be a writer. The 28-year-old has been mostly housebound since 2016 and has had a few short stories published in magazines, whilst plugging away at a novel.“For years, I’ve been looking wistfully at Penguin’s Write Now scheme, which provides potential year-long support for under-represented writers trying to break into the industry, including those with disabilities. Sadly, they’ve always required physical attendance at workshops before,” she said. But because of coronavirus, suddenly the scheme will be conducted online. It means for the first time, Elliot was able to send in an application. “It’s entirely possible I won’t be selected – but at least now I’ll know, instead of being prevented from even giving it a try.”Last week, churches and cathedrals across the UK broadcast Easter services online, with the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, speaking from his kitchen using an iPad. Karin Turner, 42, who has a brain injury and broken ankle, is now able to “go to church” online with her pastor in his living room.“I had been missing the feeling of community. Being able to listen to my pastor preach, hear stories about what is happening in the wider community and have some leadership has made the difference,” she said. “Of course, you can pray and have faith at home, but a big part of Christianity is community and it is difficult to feel cut off from that.”Even healthcare has opened up disabled people who have long campaigned to see their doctors virtually, report they are now being offered Skype time with consultants.As well as joy at being offered new opportunities, many feel frustrated that it took the non-disabled world to become house-bound before access was granted. Emma Duke, 21, who has Pots syndrome – which results in an abnormally increased heart rate after sitting up or standing – and neurological problems, has been trying to get remote access to film classes for her degree for the last three years in Los Angeles. She was frequently refused – “I was told it wasn’t ‘feasible’” – but the coronavirus pandemic means her entire university is now online.Rather than “more” opportunities opening up, 30-year-old Tom Staniford in Exeter describes the phenomenon as a levelling of the playing field. “I find it infuriating to see people moaning about reduced mobility, challenges of remote working, fear of illness risk, long periods of isolation – all things many disabled people already endure on a daily basis,” said Staniford, who has the rare MDP syndrome, which leaves him with physical and auditory disabilities. He thinks the lockdown could open up the chance for permanent accessibility. “But my overriding suspicion is it will be a massive missed opportunity.”Turner is more hopeful. “I feel like people are finally understanding the physical barriers disabled people face,” she said. “I’m actually really optimistic good will come out of this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7af5513c2f737babab0e27441d163a54ee477ed2/902_0_2730_1638/master/2730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fd2dc1ba92711b50c9078c7c986a293","title":"fierce rebuttals mark change to uk covid 19 media strategy","story":"Lancet editor accuses No 10 of ‘rewriting history in disinformation campaign’ Key government advisers spent a portion of the weekend writing 2,000-plus-word, line-by-line rebuttals of two highly critical news newspaper stories, in what appears to be a marked shift in media management.The responses to stories in the Sunday Times and Financial Times, posted to the government’s website without an author credit, are unlikely to reach anything like the audiences who read the original articles – but suggest deep concern in Whitehall regarding criticism of the handling of the pandemic.Furious government rebuttals of press stories are nothing new, nor is the practice of posting them to an official website. The difference this time is the manner in which the authors of the pieces dedicated themselves to going through each piece so meticulously.One response was to a widely shared piece by the Sunday Times Insight team, which built the case that Britain wasted five weeks in appreciating the threat of the virus due to mismanagement and a focus on Brexit at the top of government. Sources said those involved in the “team effort” to respond to the piece included some of Boris Johnson’s political aides, one of Matt Hancock’s key advisers, and a number of government officials, who worked throughout the day to challenge some of the points made in the piece.While some of the rebuttals were over semantics, others focused on specifics. One point complained that when the Sunday Times criticised the government for allowing 279,000 items of protective equipment to be sent from the UK to China in the early days of the outbreak, the newspaper failed to point out that 12m items had since come back in the other direction.However, government ministers may find that doing their own journalism is an equally fraught process. One of those quoted in the government’s rebuttal was Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet medical journal. Horton himself is now rebutting the rebuttal, accusing the government of “deliberately rewriting history in its ongoing Covid-19 disinformation campaign”.The second piece that angered ministers was an article by Peter Foster in the Financial Times, which criticised the government’s attempts to persuade industry to build new ventilators for hospitals. In a sign of changing attitudes to media, the government’s 2,900-word rebuttal to this piece focused as much on Foster’s tweets about the story as the original piece – potentially recognising that the number of people who read an inidual article on a news website can often be smaller than the number of people who see a Twitter thread.Although both rebuttals were widely shared in political and journalism circles on Twitter, they are unlikely to reach a mass audience. The original Sunday Times piece already clocked in at just over 5,000 words. The government’s response – setting out what they claimed to be a “series of falsehoods and errors” in a piece that “actively misrepresents the enormous amount of work that was going on in government at the earliest stages of the coronavirus outbreak” – was 2,000 words long.Instead, a recently departed government press aide speculated that the real purpose may have been to blunt the impact of the critical narrative taking hold in other outlets and being repeated by broadcast news outlets that reach millions of people.A government source said they had always responded to articles perceived to be inaccurate: “The length of our rebuttal depends on how much we have to correct and how much any article misrepresents what’s actually going on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab3361b547cc0113ab31c011c753c0c91d07b51/0_14_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7685d7025d42d2bbd631b295d5fb558","title":"germany takes tentative steps back to normality as coronavirus lockdown eases","story":"Shops start reopening, but Merkel warns Germans to stay ‘disciplined and watchful’As shops across parts of Germany took their first tentative steps back to normality since lockdown rules were introduced a month ago, Andreas Trost took stock at the window of a haberdashery in the Potsdam district of Babelsberg, west of Berlin.“Not exactly life as we’ve known it,” he said, reading the sign in the window which said that customers would only be allowed to enter in controlled numbers “as long as you don’t partake in small talk”, that browsing was not allowed – and please wash your hands before entering.Whilst Trost said he was looking forward to “something of the eerie mood in the empty streets” disappearing, he said he also had some trepidation about the move, which will see small shops of up to 800 sq m reopen.“I’m quite nervous about the relaxation of the rules in that I’m concerned that people will no longer take the illness seriously, and we could soon end up with another lockdown,” the customer service adviser for Berlin Water Works said.“The sense of solidarity which was obvious at the beginning is starting to disintegrate. And as long as I can’t hug my friends, I won’t feel that life is anything like normal.”Simon, one of 10,000 secondary school students in the state of Brandenburg due to take their exams on Monday, under strict hygiene and physical distancing rules, said he was glad that he was being allowed to sit exams at all after some authorities discussed rewarding exam certificates based on average marks instead.“I didn’t fancy being labelled my whole life as being one of those forced to get the ‘emergency Abitur’,” he said, ahead of a geography exam and sipping on a latte bought from a cafe selling drinks from behind a perspex window in its doorway.“Even though it’s been an uncertain few weeks, which might affect my performance, I’m glad to have the proper chance to show what I can do. Though the situation is far from normal,” he added.Kerstin Seefeldt was stacking the shelves of her Babelsberg bookshop, Script, eagerly preparing for a reopening on Wednesday. “I’m really looking forward to seeing my customers properly again,” she said. “I’m organising the shop so that the tables of books are like a labyrinth and customers can avoid coming into contact with each other.” Only two customers will be allowed at a time in the 30 sq m space, she said.Seefeldt ran a thrice-daily bicycle delivery service for customers during the shutdown. “It has been an intense and rewarding time of mutual solidarity. But I know that the situation is far from normal, and so I will now keep up the delivery service for people considered to be in a risk category because I’m aware that things cannot go back to normal for a long time yet, even if the shop is able to open,” she said. She added she was relieved to have been helped through a financially difficult period by a government investment grant of €9000, news of which had reached her that morning.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, urged Germans on Monday to remain “disciplined and watchful”, and warned that if attitudes towards the pandemic relaxed too quickly, another tougher lockdown may follow. “We must not lose track of the fact that we continue to be at the start of this pandemic and are far from out of the woods,” she said.Thanking Germans for – by and large – sticking to the rules of staying at home and keeping physical distance, Merkel said a lot had so far been achieved. “The infection is under control to the extent that it is not climbing exponentially any more,” she said. But a “rash easing” of the restrictions was in danger of unleashing the “unknown”, she warned.Acknowledging the plight of many people, including artists, single parents and restaurant managers,Merkel said Germans should not be “lulled into a false sense of security”. If the infection rate began to rise – which would first be visible in the statistics in two weeks’ time – “a new shutdown would be unavoidable” and that had to be prevented for the sake of the economy, she said.But there are signs that social tensions are rising in parts of the country, and the sense that this is a critical moment in tackling the virus is keenly felt. At the weekend, police struggled with several hundred protesters campaigning on Berlin’s Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz against what they saw as constraints placed on their basic rights due to the so-called Corona Verordnungen, or regulations. Amongst the protesters were anti-vaxxers, well-known conspiracy theorists, and rightwing extremists, some of whom accused the government of using the coronavirus crisis to create a dictatorship. Other similar demonstrations have taken place elsewhere across Germany.By Monday afternoon German health authorities had reported a total of 146,000 confirmed infections and 4735 deaths. The reproduction rate was slightly higher than on Friday, at 0.8, but anything under one is being considered a success by decision-makers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c13ea448e301c823408b96d617ef383f80cef2a7/0_66_3258_1956/master/3258.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=bdc1288ba9cee1ba318c950bcdbaf7ef","title":"lesotho pm thomas thabane stand down sides agree dignified retirement","story":"Government reaches deal with parties on Thomas Thabane’s immediate exit from officeLesotho’s scandal-hit prime minister will stand down immediately following an agreement between the coalition government and political parties in the southern African mountain kingdom, a joint statement said on Monday.Thomas Thabane, who has been accused of involvement in the murder of his ex-wife, will be allowed a “dignified retirement”, according to the deal negotiated by mediators from neighbouring South Africa.The 80-year-old leader appeared in court in February, where his lawyer argued that his office granted him immunity from prosecution for allegedly murdering his estranged first wife shortly before he took power.Lipolelo Thabane, 58, was shot several times at close range as she sat in a car near her home, two days before her husband’s inauguration in 2017. She had reportedly refused a orce and won a court battle to retain her privileges as first lady until any formal separation.Thabane remarried two months after her death. His current wife, Maesaiah, 42, has been charged with murder after briefly fleeing the country. Both deny any wrongdoing.The case was brought back into the spotlight in January after a letter from Lesotho’s police chief emerged claiming communication records showed that someone at the murder scene had called Thabane’s mobile phone on the day of the crime.The killing was initially blamed on unknown criminals Lesotho has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Investigators have since said they believe professional hitmen, possibly hired in South Africa, carried out the attack.Thabane had already pledged to step down at the end of July, but the South African mediator Jeff Radebe told journalists in Lesotho’s capital, Maseru, that “the timeline is immediate” for his leaving officeThe veteran politician made a final attempt to hold on to power at the weekend, sending soldiers and armoured vehicles on to the streets of Maseru on Saturday to restore order against “rogue national elements”. The move prompted authorities in South Africa, which surrounds Lesotho, to send envoys to the poor mountain kingdom of 2 million people.Thabane said he had deployed the army to deal with forces he said wanted to destabilise Lesotho.The country has experienced several coups since gaining independence from Britain in 1966. In 1998 at least 58 people and eight South African soldiers died and parts of Maseru were damaged during a political standoff and subsequent fighting.The latest upheaval follows Thabane’s decision last month to suspend parliament without consultation over the coronavirus pandemic. Lesotho has no confirmed cases of Covid-19, and the move was challenged in the constitutional court by coalition partners as well as some 20 rivals within his own party.The court ruled against the suspension on Friday, calling it “irrational”, paving the way for a threatened vote of no confidence against Thabane once parliament reconvenes.“He has nowhere to hide and has lost it. The electorate is against him, the judiciary and all other strategic institutions … meaning that the PM is finished,” Sofonea Shale, an independent political analyst, said on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64fa2a78fc5fc8c11aec0a33f8bcdb2963ed0940/0_0_4080_2448/master/4080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bee7a2f58ea23ef3aadb0cb638fa0993","title":"liverpool v atletico virus links interesting hypothesis says government scientist","story":"Links between the outbreak of coronavirus in Liverpool and the Champions League tie at Anfield attended by more than 3,000 Atlético Madrid supporters should be explored, a government scientist acknowledged on Monday.Supporters travelled from Madrid to attend the game on 11 March when Spain’s capital was already implementing a partial lockdown. This month Liverpool city council’s director of public health, Matthew Ashton, told the  the fixture should have been called off, and at the weekend the mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, said it was a “mistake” to allow the fans to attend.New figures show that 246 people have died with coronavirus in Liverpool’s NHS hospitals, increasing anger over the decision to allow the game to go ahead. The government’s deputy chief scientific adviser, Angela McLean, said at the daily coronavirus press conference at Downing Street the link between the illness in the two cities “is an interesting hypothesis”.She told a reporter from the Liverpool Echo: “I’m genuinely sad to hear that so many people in Liverpool have been unwell and so many have died. I think it would be very interesting to see in the future when all the science is done what relationship there is between the viruses that have circulated in Liverpool and the viruses that have circulated in Spain.”McLean said the general policy at the time was that attending football games was not seen as a large “extra risk”. The fixture, which resulted in Liverpool going out of the Champions League after losing 3-2, was held at a time when the city of Liverpool had just six confirmed cases of coronavirus. Madrid had by then become a centre for the spread of the virus. Spain’s top league, La Liga, decided that day that all matches must be played behind closed doors.That week up to 250,000 people attended the four-day Cheltenham Festival – the government has faced repeated criticism for allowing it to go ahead. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, defended the decision on Sunday.  revealed this month how the organisers of the event cited the presence of Boris Johnson at an international rugby match shortly before the race meeting was due to begin in a letter explaining why they decided to go ahead.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who led the Downing Street press conference on Monday, said it was likely that because of the unprecedented situation coronavirus has presented that there will be lessons to learn for the future. “At every stage in this crisis we have been guided by the scientific advice and have been making the right decisions at the right time.There is often a wrong time to put certain measures in place, thinking about sustainability and everything else, and at all parts of this we have been guided by that science.

The world is using less and less oil and producers now feel how this translates.” reported over the weekend that a record 160m barrels of oil was being stored in “supergiant” oil tankers outside the world’s largest shipping ports, including the US Gulf, following the deepest fall in oil demand in 25 years because of the coronavirus pandemic.The last time floating storage reached levels close to this was in the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, when traders stored more than 100m barrels at sea before offloading stocks when the economy began to recover.The price collapse in US oil market - known in the industry as the West Texas Intermediate price - accelerated because it is the last day oil producers can trade barrels that are scheduled for delivery next month, when oil storage is expected to reach capacity.Concerns over the economy, which directly affect oil demand, have been heightened by the growing standoff between the US president and state governors over whether the US can begin to lift restrictions on movement and businesses.Global oil prices are expected to begin recovering over the second half of the year as tight restrictions on travel to help curb the spread of the virus are lifted, raising demand for fuels and oil. The world’s largest oil-producing nations have agreed a deal to hold back between 10m to 20m barrels of oil a day from the global market from May, and many oil companies are likely to shut their wells as financial pressures mount.Cailin Birch, global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: “US crude oil production has begun to fall in the last two weeks, and will continue to fall in the coming months as already heavily indebted shale firms scale back activity or are forced into bankruptcy or consolidation.”Despite the historic production cuts, most analysts believe that oil prices will fail to reach the same price levels recorded at the beginning of the year before the outbreak. The global oil price, under the brent crude measure, reached highs of almost $69 a barrel in January before plummeting to less than $23 a barrel at the end of March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6f8f541e514c343a78bd0bba660ca965180fe06/114_412_5041_3025/master/5041.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=438565da868a8a75bdf1b69ce3ef5dce","title":"russia changes address embassy boris nemtsov square prague","story":"Embassy denies Czech claims it changed address because it bore murdered politician’s nameThe Russian embassy in Prague has said it will not take an address on Boris Nemtsov Square after the plaza in front of the building was renamed to honour the Russian opposition politician who was murdered in 2015.Czech media reported last week that the embassy had changed its official address in order to avoid the reference to Nemtsov, a critic of Vladimir Putin who was gunned down in sight of the Kremlin.In a pointed note, the Russian embassy accused the Czech foreign ministry of politicising a “technical” step to maintain the embassy’s official address as the one used by its consular ision.Calling the street “historical” and “the probability of its renaming much lower than that of the recently appeared ‘Boris Nemtsov square’”, it wrote: “The embassy has decided to continue using 36 Korunovacni Street as its official address.”Prague councillors voted to rename the square, previously called Under the Chestnuts, to mark the fifth anniversary of Nemtsov’s death, a symbolic step also taken in Washington, Kyiv and Vilnius.The move was championed by Prague’s mayor, Zdeněk Hřib, who said it was connected to the “Czech human rights tradition”.“It seems odd to me. Even Vladimir Putin said the murder of Boris Nemtsov was wicked and cynical and its organisers must be punished,” Hřib said this week, according to Czech media.Tensions have flared recently between Russia and the Czech Republic. This month, the bronze statue of Marshal Ivan Konev, a Soviet-era military commander, was removed from its pedestal in Prague, leading to protests from the Russian embassy.On Monday, a senior Russian Orthodox church official noted that Russia had promised a symmetrical response and would “probably have to dismantle on the territory of the Russian Federation a monument to some Czech figure”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7139e6ecebf67efa3c9ae3fa52375cd7f264334/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78a4ca01b35dd38c76f3a88ef0a8e75f","title":"the way we once lived is now redundant we need to reinvent ourselves","story":"There will be no going back to ‘normal’. Our cherished concept of work is increasingly meaningless – the future belongs to those who understand the arts of lifeThe infantilising of the people by our leaders is horribly revealing of the English psyche. “Jam tomorrow and jam yesterday – but never jam today.” Only it is not jam in this case, it is life-saving personal protective equipment. I specify “English” because Nicola Sturgeon addresses her nation as grownups and Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel pay their people the same respect. Now, armed with the knowledge that our prime minister bunked off Cobra meetings as this crisis unfolded, we are being told nothing can really be decided until he comes back from his convalescence. So we are stuck with ministers in supply teacher mode.Everything has changed and we need to prepare for the new normal. Lockdown isn’t ending any time soon. There is no simple choice between saving lives and saving the economy the two are intertwined. There is no going back to BC: before corona. Some of us knew this from day one, others are still in denial. There is the unmistakable feeling that a monumental shift in how we live is coming, one way or another, a shift that has long been latent. Those of us in rich countries have been intent on pushing the climate emergency into the future, but now our money won’t save us. Our vulnerability just might. But this requires humility. The idea that Boris Johnson will “bounce back” into his job is as ludicrous as thinking the economy will “bounce back”.Macron articulated this sense of shock last week when he said: “This is not a time for falling back on comfortable ideology. We need to get off the beaten track, reinvent ourselves, find new ways of living, not least of all me.”Some of the new ways of living are starting to emerge, but there is a deep resistance to the fact that they may be permanent. Daily we see how Covid-19 has made visible existing inequalities of space, class, ethnicity and gender, but daily we see newer isions, too. There is the ide between those who can work at home and those who can’t, whether surgeons or hairdressers. There are those who find solace in their inner worlds and are able to treat this time as leisure, even on limited incomes, and those who are lonely and completely adrift.There are signs of renewal or reinvention from many young people whose lives are on hold, but who are coping incredibly well in the circumstances, and from small and local businesses that have adapted very quickly where they can. But rigidity is found in nearly all big institutions – from government and the EU to big business and much of our cultural establishment. There is little agility here, just a hankering for the fantasy return to “normal”.Many seem to hold on to a cherished concept of work that is increasingly meaningless. Some people are still working long hours while as a society we face mass unemployment. Whatever people are doing on Zoom all day, it seems they are still being productive, so surely they never need to go to an office again? A lot of pointless commuting can stop people will have to admit they mostly go to work to escape home. There is nothing wrong with this, but reinventing ourselves requires a degree of honesty.Indeed, one of the hardest things about this crisis is that we all have to live with the choices we have made, whether we are on our own or with partners, with or without children. The everyday – untempered by other distractions – is the atomised existential crisis. Is this my life? What happened?If we work less, we consume less, and we have long known that this is what we need to do to avert the climate crisis. Do we need all this stuff? Clothes and shoes? Do we need people to tell us next season’s colour? Do we need tantrum-y chefs on our TV screens? Do we need endless lifestyle tips from celebrities? Well, no.We need smaller supply chains when it comes to our farming. We need contact with other people. Better tech. We need to disband the nuclear family, which appears no longer fit for purpose.We have long been warned that almost half of us would lose our jobs because of the rise of AI for a very different reason, this future has arrived. This will clearly be hard. The pandemic kills some people fast, but it will kill others slowly, through poverty.In 1930, as the Great Depression got underway, John Maynard Keynes wrote in his lovely essay Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren, about “the painfulness of readjustment between one economic period and another”. I look to culture to guide us, but see only a rush to stream everything amid mourning for the loss of live performance. This is the same paralysis that has been evident in the arts establishment over the past few years, during which the only thing they had to tell us was that Brexit was bad. Innovative thinking is now as hard to come by as yeast.Maybe it is too soon to consider all this. The justified criticism of our government does not alter the fact we are a one-party state for the foreseeable future, so our social rebirth must come from below. It will not be top down.We can breathe the cleaner air while we miss the pub garden and we can take stock. Keynes wondered about the challenge of spare time. “Meanwhile, there will be no harm in making mild preparations for our destiny, in encouraging, and experimenting in, the arts of life as well as the activities of purpose.”The past has been full of purpose and activity and busyness. Much of it is now redundant. The future belongs to those who understand the arts of life. It is a big ask, this – to reinvent the wheel – but that time has arrived."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7738daa1ba8449c8ff24d4219f5464664c744bb9/0_605_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd0ca8e0f52b12338ae4121008a2dfa","title":"my shrunken world lockdown in camden in pictures","story":"Challenging herself to see her immediate environment in a new way, photographer Sarah Lee, who has been on complete lockdown for over four weeks, shot these images on an iPhone within a one-mile radius of her home in Camden Town, north London"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4233628.1587412601!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"galway school opts out of this year s junior cert exams","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Coláiste Bhaile Chláir said the Junior Certificate was a milestone in a student’s education, but students had missed them before and it did not hinder their ability to sit the Leaving Certificate. File photograph: Bryan O’BrienA secondary school in Co Galway has become the first in the State to reject the proposal to hold the equivalent of the Junior Certificate in the next school year.Coláiste Bhaile Chláir in Claregalway will instead allow its students to complete their work for the rest of the term and be graded by their teachers.Though it only opened in 2013, Coláiste Bhaile Chláir, a multidenominational community college, is one of the largest secondary schools in the country with more than 1,000 pupils. It is under the patronage of the Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board (GRETB).On Friday, the Minister for Education Joe McHugh announced the cancellation of the Junior Certificate examinations, which were due to take place in June, because of the coronavirus pandemic.Instead, he proposed that they be replaced by assessments and project work to be completed as school-based exams early in the next school year.In a statement published on its website, the school said such an approach would create unnecessary stress for its students.The school said the Junior Certificate is a milestone in a student’s education, but students have missed them before and it did not hinder their ability to sit the Leaving Certificate.The school added: “We wish our students during this time of national emergency to focus on their health and wellbeing. We do not wish to see students over the summer months caught up inside preparing for exams, worrying about when they might go ahead, if they go ahead.“What if all that time were spent wasted when they could have been outside playing, working and helping family and friends through this difficult time?“We wish that upon our return to school in the new academic year that we all start afresh, renewed and re-invigorated.”It added that many of the school’s teachers will be involved in the correction and monitoring of corrections for the Leaving Certificate examinations if they take place as planned in the late summer.Instead, the school has proposed that students will complete assigned work for the remainder of the term and be awarded a grade by their teachers.The grade will be added to the 100 per cent already given for oral, practical and project work to determine their overall final grade. That grade will appear on the Junior Certificate profile of achievement (JCPA).“ We believe in the quality and professionalism of our teachers to award grades based on clearly defined criteria and using work already completed to date,” the school explained.“We, as of now, do not know when we will be able to return and to what extent that return will look like in September“We believe that our approach will help to keep 3rd year students focussed and engaged for these final 6 weeks of school term“Above all, we believe that the plan outlined above is in the best interests of our students in Coláiste Bhaile Chláir.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: RTÉ PlayerAn Irish musician has told of her struggle and feeling of being “forgotten” whilst stuck in her cabin aboard the Ruby Princess Cruise Ship in Sydney since the outbreak of Covid-19.Kate Heneghan (24), from Castlebar in Co Mayo, has been stuck on the cruise ship just outside Sydney for the past 28 days. There are five Irish people still on the ship, four members of the band Emerald Tide and an engineer.The passengers of the cruise ship got word on March 16th that the prime minister of New Zealand was closing the ports and no longer allowing ships to enter the country, which resulted in the ship making a three-day voyage back to Sydney, where 2,700 passengers disembarked on March 19th.“On March 20th, we got word that there were positive cases on board, so we were quarantined and isolated here then on March 21st,” Ms Heneghan said on the Late Late Show on Friday night.The Ruby Princess cruise ship, owned by Carnival Corp, has been docked at Port Kembla in New South Wales since and has been linked to hundreds of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Australia and about a third of the country’s reported deaths.The violinist and harpist described her situation as a “huge scandal”. Speaking to the talk show host Ryan Tubridy, Ms Heneghan said her contract as a musician aboard the cruise ship was due to finish on April 4th, but she remains unaware to date of when she and the other band members will be allowed to disembark from the ship.“It’s a big political game of chess at the moment,” Ms Heneghan told Mr Tubridy, regarding the police investigation into whether there was criminal negligence in the handling of the health issues on the cruise ship.“We’re just pawns in this big political game and kind of forgotten about until decisions are made and we get news that we can disembark and get repatriated home.”“We were told via intercom by the hotel general manager, who updates us daily, that there was a possibility of us going to Manila to let off the Filipino crew. One of our sister ships is outside Manila and the Philippines won’t let them port. We also heard through the media that we might be going to the United States, which would be disastrous for us because we don’t have visas,” she said.Ms Heneghan told Mr Tubridy that her “one wish” for the four Irish in her band and the fifth Irish citizen on board is “to get off this boat before it sails away”.Despite the situation, the young woman was in good spirits and said “structure and routine” have been “absolutely vital in maintaining a bit of sanity”. Ms Heneghan spends her days doing yoga, practicing her instruments, watching Netflix and staying in contact with friends and family.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231819.1587147602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brexit a key issue says us special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS special envoy for Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney: “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal.”  Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has said he intends to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as the coronavirus restrictions are lifted, as he prepares to assume his post.Mr Mulvaney said a key focus for him in the coming weeks is how the Covid-19 crisis will impact on Brexit. The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

Photograph: Ina FassbenderAFP via GettyAs Germany began to reopen its shops and schools on Monday, a visibly alarmed chancellor Angela Merkel warned it was “illusory” to think the coronavirus crisis had passed.With nearly 4,500 Covid-19 deaths so far, and another 1,800 new infections registered from Sunday to Monday, Dr Merkel said Germany was still at the start of the pandemic and was “not over the hill by a long shot”.Earlier, Dr Merkel read the riot act to senior members of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU), warning them not to exploit the crisis for political gain by engaging in “discussion orgies” over loosening the lockdown.After introducing early testing in January, and racing last month to impose the toughest lockdown, Germany’s 16 regional leaders are now competing in public to be the first to loosen restrictions.That prompted an unusually emotional appearance by the German leader. A scientist by training, Dr Merkel said she was nervous about loosening the lockdown before breaking the chain of infection. The result of Monday’s partial lifting of lockdown measures, she said, would not be visible for two weeks.“It would be a crying shame if, with our eyes wide open, we walked into a relapse,” said Dr Merkel. “We cannot endanger our first successes and for not one minute should we feel secure.”On Friday, Germany’s disease control institute said the rate of infection – the number of people each ill person contaminates – had dropped below one for the first time, prompting federal health minister Jens Spahn to declare the virus “under control”.Shops reopenAcross the country on Monday, each of Germany’s 16 federal states began lifting lockdown measures in different ways. Most have allowed shops – from florists to fashion retailers – reopen with floor space of up to 800sq m some states have opened zoos and gyms while others have relaxed the “contact ban”, allowing gatherings of up to 20 people in public, up from two.Many states reopened schools for students taking state examinations, with other pupils to follow early next moth.As federal states loosen their lockdowns, two – Saxony and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern – have made face masks obligatory in public while Bavaria is to follow suit next week.The staggered return to normality across Germany was greeted with relief by smaller traders, but frustration among owners of larger stores and shopping centres.“Everyone who enters the store gets a mask from us. There are protective shields at the till. It’s about making people feel comfortable,” said one perfume shop manager in western Berlin.On the street outside, pedestrians watched the reopening with ambivalence. “It’s nice to see things livening up again,” said Hatun, a young Berlin woman.“I’m not sure if it is the right thing to do yet,” said Friederike, her friend. “It’s good to get a few things but not for a shopping spree.”Car plantsAfter a four-week production shutdown, Daimler began reopening its factories, with Volkswagen and other car companies likely to follow later this week. Germany’s car giants, a pillar of the country’s economy, have warned of an unprecedented financial crisis for them through coronavirus restrictions, and are lobbying for state-subsidised sweeteners to help sell their product.“They are facing their greatest crisis since the second World War,” said Prof Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a car industry analyst. “They will have to reduce capacity both in their facilities and in staff numbers.”Across the border in Poland, people were allowed to return to parks and forests after weeks of being sequestered at home. Open-air markets in the Czech Republic also reopened on Monday as part of a six-week push to lift the lockdown.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Teacher union boss sets five pre-conditions for schools to reopenMet to launch review of school police officers amid claims black pupils are \u0026#39disproportionately\u0026#39 affectedComment: Coronavirus has accelerated eight mega-trends that will transform everythingDon\u0026#39t name and shame lockdown rebels unless they are convicted, Justice Secretary tells policeExtinction Rebellion protests costs Scotland Yard £12 million cuts from frontline policing, letters revealMatt Hancock\u0026#39s pledge to test 100,000 people a day for coronavirus was \u0026#39arbitrary\u0026#39, insiders sayExclusive: Millions of pieces of PPE are being shipped from Britain to Europe despite NHS shortagesComment: Celeb-obsessed America is utterly perplexed by British outrage against Meghan and HarryMasks for the public will not be recommended to the Government over fears there would be too few for NHS staffHundreds of thousands needing to be shielded from coronavirus have still not been contacted, investigation showsSocial care leaders warn of \u0026#39enormous anxiety\u0026#39 in care homes as fears over PPE shortages mountNHS volunteer army prevented from helping most vulnerable in society due to red tapeScottish pupils\u0026#39 grades could be lowered this year if their school has poor academic recordLibya\u0026#39s UN-backed government says it could break Khalifa Haftar\u0026#39s siege of Tripoli after offensiveCanada killer was an alcoholic millionaire \u0026#39whose denture business was shut because of Covid-19\u0026#39 B-list celebs and a baffling website: is BBC Bitesize Daily really the solution to home-schooling?More than 100,000 claims submitted on first day of coronavirus furlough schemeCouncils get greater powers to create car-free streetsBAME patients face disproportionately high risk of death from coronavirus, new data showsComment: The Government says it’s ‘guided by the scientific advice’ – but is this just a cunning excuse?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"isil linked jihadis target mozambiques gas fields","story":"For more than two years the fighters waged a war so shadowy no-one really knew why they were fighting or even what they called themselves.They seemed to come out of nowhere, bands of masked men who attacked villages in northern Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province, carried out mass beheadings and then vanished as mysteriously as they had appeared. Up to 1,000 soldiers and civilians have so far been killed by the group. Then, in the past few weeks, everything changed.No longer masked, the militants seized important towns and villages in a series of sophisticated operations launched under the noses of a Kremlin-linked Russian mercenary outfit.Unfurling the black flag of Islamic State in southern Africa for the first time, the fighters defiantly declared their intention to turn a region that will soon be vital to Britain’s energy security into a Sharia-based caliphate.Until recently, Cabo Delgado’s insurgency had garnered little attention in Western capitals.For many politicians, it seemed to be just another obscure conflict taking place in a chronically corrupt country with a long history of violence.But the latest attacks and the threat they potentially pose to what is becoming one of the world’s most important gas regions are causing a rapid and urgent reassessment.Until recently, the violence in Cabo Delgado had indeed seemed like a local affair.True, the group responsible for it had initially been dominated by foreigners, radical east African Muslims who fled down the Swahili coast after their leader, Aboud Rogo, was killed by police in Kenya in 2012. But they were rapidly able to find adherents among the local population.Cabo Delgado should be one of the richest regions in Africa. Not only does it boast the world’s largest ruby mine, it is home to a £44bn liquefied natural gas (LNG) programme — the continent’s largest ever energy project — that is being developed by some of the world’s biggest oil companies.With investment in the LNG project set to double over the coming decade, Cabo Delgado is turning Mozambique into an energy superpower, one of the ten largest producers of natural gas in the world.As Britain’s North Sea reserves dwindle, the UK is among those queuing up for a share of the region’s resources. Last year Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, entered into a joint venture to buy 2.6m tonnes of LNG from Mozambique a year for the next two decades.The mostly Muslim population of Cabo Delgado has seen little of the wealth, however. The region is by far the least developed in Mozambique and its 2.3 million people the poorest, making some ripe for recruitment.As its ranks swelled, the group -- which operated under a series of names, most commonly Ansar al-Sunna -- grew steadily bolder after launching its first attacks in 2017, culminating in its apparent adoption into the ISIL franchise at some point in the past six months.Increasingly worried by the group\u0027s growing capability, Mozambique’s government last year deployed 200 Russian mercenaries to Cabo Delgado from the Wagner Group, believed to be owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to Vladimir Putin.Although the Russians arrived with attack helicopters, drones and sophisticated weaponry they were swiftly forced to make a “tactical retreat”. As many as 12 Russians have been killed, according to diplomats.Success against the Russians seems to have emboldened the militants further.From mid-March the number of attacks has surged.In the most significant, militants marched into the port of Mocimboa da Praia on 23rd March and seized control of the town.  Although they marched out 24 hours later — replicating a tactic used by al Shabaab in Somalia and Isil fighters in the Middle East — they had made their point. Mocimboa da Praia is just an hour’s drive from gas fields.Amid a collapse in oil prices and economic uncertainty unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic, the escalation in the insurgency is making western energy companies increasingly anxious.The reaction to the jihadist occupation of some towns, with many locals coming onto the streets to cheer, will do little to allay their nerves.It is difficult to tell how genuine the support is. Stepping up their public relations campaign, the Islamists have sought to woo people by distributing stolen food and blowing up cash machines to dole out banknotes.But support may also be rooted in fear. “We don’t want to hurt you,” a militant leader told residents in one captured town, according to video footage. “If you do not report us to the police, we will live with you.”“But if you denounce us and tell the pigs where we are hiding, the next time we come here we will kill everything, even chickens and eggs, old people and babies.”The threats, Western officials say, are working because neither locals nor the energy companies have any confidence in the ability of the underpaid and demoralised security forces to stand up to the jihadists.Instead of fighting when towns were attacked, many soldiers and police officers have been ditching their uniforms and blending into the civilian population, locals say.Few therefore believe Mozambique’s national police commander, Bernardino Rafael, who claims that the situation in Cabo Delgado is under control and the insurgents are merely a handful of “criminals” who will soon be dealt with.“When armed men come, instead of defending the population, the police flee,” said Viana Magalhaes, a senior opposition politician.  “If a group of insurgents can take control of a whole province, then the country has no protection.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/19/TELEMMGLPICT000229640429_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPw6h6usEMXF3qdE5C2AFDryY_X8ymk9Ipv6-J9ecbiI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"meghan harrys pompous diatribe against press plumbs new depths","story":"In recent years, the couple\u0026#39s stock in Britain has plummetedThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s letter to the tabloid press is staggering in its tone-deafness. At a time when relatives are saying tearful farewells over FaceTime and a shattered global economy has left millions fearing for the future, our vapid Prince and Princess across the water have chosen to launch a broadside against the media from their Hollywood hideout. Though they claim to value press freedom, their actions amount to a kind of censorship it is obvious that they hope to trade in critical coverage for that of a more deferential flavour, delivered by journalists they have helped choose in advance. Both the self-pitying tone and unfortunate timing carry echoes of the Duke of Windsor, who spent much of World War Two holed up in comfy exile, furiously lobbying the Government to grant his wife HRH status. Most of Team Sussex’s output reads like a cross between a self-congratulatory LinkedIn post and a faux-profound lifestyle blog, and today’s instalment did not disappoint. Apart from the narcissism on display, the letter is replete with corporate gibberish (“to spotlight”, “policy being instated”) and pompous melodrama no longer, they say, will they offer themselves up as currency for an economy of clickbait and distortion. Given their desire for a less prominent role in public life, however, they seem rather too eager to mention that they remain a Duke and Duchess. The statement contains almost one reminder of their continued royal status per paragraph. Their PR strategy has always been a case of one step forward, ten steps back. Last year, the pair rounded off a triumphant tour of Africa, which had accrued countless positive UK media headlines, by launching legal action against the Mail on Sunday. Days ago, the couple were photographed delivering food to the needy in Los Angeles, looking down to earth and striking exactly the right note for the situation. Today’s developments will overshadow their good work once again. In recent years, their stock in Britain has plummeted, as overwhelming national goodwill and joy at their wedding gave way to irritation, then outright annoyance, at their hypocrisies. Yet this morning’s missive coincides with the Duchess’s first promotional interview since the pair shelved their royal duties, to discuss a new voiceover role in a Disney Plus documentary about elephants. (Meghan would know all about packing your trunk and saying goodbye to the circus.) While their disdain for the British people is increasingly obvious, choosing such a climactic moment to indulge in this bizarre rant seems calculated to boost their profile Stateside. The Sussexes’ failed attempt to combine their royal status with that of the celebrity influencer shows the tough predicament facing today’s royals. It is harder than ever for them to lead by example, in the style of previous royals such as Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who used their platform to extol the domestic virtues of monogamy and family life. Society is simply less deferential, the press and public more alert to hypocrisy. Where once it guided morals and mores, the Royal Family is now more likely to influence fashion at best - and at worst, to mirror contemporary irritations back at us. In the Sussexes’ case, they have come to embody the excesses of identity politics. Their paranoid loathing of the press suggests they inhabit a world of perceived slights and victim status. Their demands for uncritical respect and supplication from the media, while complaining of mistreatment from a privileged position, reflects the combination of bullying and performative victimhood unique to these identitarian times. Their initial move to Canada gave the Sussexes the chance to combine duty with greater privacy. They could have lived a more retired life, while working on behalf of the Queen and promoting Commonwealth interests. Instead they’ve spent the time building a pair of vapid lifestyle brands, the now-defunct ‘Sussex Royal’ and ‘Archwell’, which sound like a cigarette manufacturer and a line of corrective footwear, respectively. Too woke even for Trudeau’s Canada, they scuttled out in a private jet just before full lockdown, proving that their goal was Los Angeles (a town famed for its privacy and modesty) and the lure of elephant voiceovers, all along. While the Sussexes were busy burning the last of their bridges with the British people, other family members are shining more brightly by contrast. The Queen’s dignified restraint as she consoled and encouraged her people amid one of the severest crises of her long reign was deeply moving. Prince Philip may have stepped back from public life on the grounds of his great age, but he still put out a stirring statement honouring unsung frontline workers earlier today. Despite their slightly earnest mode of speech, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge radiated genuine concern as they spoke to teachers via Zoom last week. The message from all of them – ‘It’s not just about Me.’Teacher union boss sets five pre-conditions for schools to reopenMet to launch review of school police officers amid claims black pupils are \u0026#39disproportionately\u0026#39 affectedComment: Coronavirus has accelerated eight mega-trends that will transform everythingDon\u0026#39t name and shame lockdown rebels unless they are convicted, Justice Secretary tells policeExtinction Rebellion protests costs Scotland Yard £12 million cuts from frontline policing, letters revealMatt Hancock\u0026#39s pledge to test 100,000 people a day for coronavirus was \u0026#39arbitrary\u0026#39, insiders sayExclusive: Millions of pieces of PPE are being shipped from Britain to Europe despite NHS shortagesComment: Celeb-obsessed America is utterly perplexed by British outrage against Meghan and HarryMasks for the public will not be recommended to the Government over fears there would be too few for NHS staffHundreds of thousands needing to be shielded from coronavirus have still not been contacted, investigation showsSocial care leaders warn of \u0026#39enormous anxiety\u0026#39 in care homes as fears over PPE shortages mountNHS volunteer army prevented from helping most vulnerable in society due to red tapeScottish pupils\u0026#39 grades could be lowered this year if their school has poor academic recordLibya\u0026#39s UN-backed government says it could break Khalifa Haftar\u0026#39s siege of Tripoli after offensiveCanada killer was an alcoholic millionaire \u0026#39whose denture business was shut because of Covid-19\u0026#39 B-list celebs and a baffling website: is BBC Bitesize Daily really the solution to home-schooling?More than 100,000 claims submitted on first day of coronavirus furlough schemeCouncils get greater powers to create car-free streetsBAME patients face disproportionately high risk of death from coronavirus, new data showsComment: The Government says it’s ‘guided by the scientific advice’ – but is this just a cunning excuse?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/18/TELEMMGLPICT000229435510_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"new normal cannot become permanent","story":"Humans are a bit like cats. We need to get outdoors and feel the sun on our facesCoronavirus Article Bar with counter ..On January 28, our cat Blitz was rescued from the Tube track at Tufnell Park station where he had been attacked by foxes and left for dead as 250 trains roared over his prone body. After 10 days in veterinary hospital, during which his nerve-damaged tail was removed, broken vertebrae sealed, and his exposed sciatic nerve patched up, Blitz was brought home – under strict instructions not to go outside. He was in lockdown and as a family we were traumatised – could 2020 get any worse?At first Blitz was confined to a cage to limit his movement but even when allowed to roam freely around the house he kept trying to break out through the cat flap that no longer recognised his microchip. In the night we’d be woken by him howling as he scratched at the door. We couldn’t understand why Blitz took house arrest so badly: wasn’t our lovely home, with its cosy beds, tuna on tap, attentive and loving staff, enough for him? Why on earth would he want to go outside where it wasn’t safe?A few days later, I went in to work to be told the office was closed and I’d be working from home for the foreseeable. Then the schools where my wife and children worked and studied shut, and like Blitz we were told to stay home for our own safety.I was overjoyed. No longer to rise at 6.30 and cram myself into an overcrowded train. No longer to sit in a boring office. No longer to decide from which shop to purchase an overpriced sandwich (in London, you’re never more than 15 feet from a Pret). My wife no longer has to drive to Walthamstow to deal with surly kids, my daughter’s GCSE exams have been cancelled and my son no longer runs the dinner-queue gauntlet.The new normal consists of my Skyping and emailing colleagues (feigning ignorance of Teams), my wife cooking a wide array of adventurous new dishes, the kids doing a modicum of homework and filling their days with Youtube, books, writing songs, watching films and nursing Blitz back to health.We dusted off the bicycle machine and compete to see who can ride the furthest each day, tallying up the kilometres when this is all over, we’ve promised to travel that distance (at the moment we’re in Northern Italy). I’ve gone back to work on a novel I’ve been meaning to rewrite for ten years – half-hoping I’ll be furloughed to complete the final draft. I’m sleeping better than ever I even remember my dreams. Every Thursday we clap with the rest of the street, an intensely moving moment that the children will remember for a lifetime.Obviously, I’m worried – not just about my kids, but also my parents, in their Seventies and both in poor health. However on the whole, we are lucky. We have a large house with a garden, and my wife and I have jobs which, unlike working in the NHS, in supermarkets, or driving buses, are secure and safe.If your job is insecure, you have an abusive partner, or you live in a small flat with small kids, lockdown must be hell nevertheless, according a survey commissioned by the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission (FFCC) and the Food Foundation charity, “only nine per cent of Britons want to return to life as normal after the end of the lockdown triggered by coronavirus pandemic.”The government are concerned that when they tell the country to go back to work, a lot of people will say – sod that. How wonderful, I sometimes think, as I knock off another bottle of wine and watch an old Taskmaster for the umpteenth time, is our new normal – why can’t it ever be thus?And yet. Blitz didn’t like being cooped up, watching the world through the window. He wanted to explore the great outdoors, have adventures with his sister, feel the sun on his fur, hunt mice and poop in the neighbours’ flowerbeds. One night last week, he managed to pick the cat flap and escape. We searched the streets, put up posters, appealed online: nothing. As well as being frantic, and a trifle irritated (10 days in vet hospital doesn’t come cheap) we were also puzzled. Why would a cat choose to leave a warm, loving house, expose himself to mortal danger – again – for no apparent reason?Early one morning, unable to sleep, I trudged the streets of N19 looking for Blitz. As I walked through the park, deserted apart from a few selfish joggers spreading death on the breeze, feeling the sun on my face, all I wanted was to keep walking: to watch a match, attend a gig, swap bad jokes in busy pubs, get on a train, plane or hovercraft and get out into the big bad world – whatever the risks.Humans are a bit like cats. We share their love of adventure, their fascination with the unknown. If we had been otherwise, we might never have left the African plain to conquer continents, climb mountains, explore ocean trenches and outer space. It’s in our nature. Staying home watching box sets might work for a few months, but when you’re on your death bed what would you rather remember – sitting on the sofa or swimming in churning oceans, the view from precarious precipices, arriving in strange cities in the middle of the night?Yesterday Blitz turned up bedraggled, filthy and ravenous after five days exploring the neighbourhood, fighting foxes, playing with tube trains. He’s none the worse for it – in fact, that devil-may-care look is back in his eyes. House cats live longer than outdoor cats – but is it living?Blitz knows the answer to that – we all do. This lockdown has been essential, an opportunity to step off the conveyor belt, take stock and recharge – but it isn’t normal. It must never become normal. Life is for living – and no-one gets out of here alive.Pandemics and epidemicsThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

More than 1 million extra claims for Universal Credit have been received since the pandemic began.A report from the Resolution Foundation think tank forecast that as many as 11.7 million people could be furloughed or unemployed over the next three months, with those in the lowest-paid sectors worst affected.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government must take urgent action to close the gaps in its Covid-19 financial support package, or many more households will fall into problem debt.”The trust is urging the government to allocate additional funding to enable all local authorities to offer payment holidays on council tax bills.If you are furloughed then your employer is keeping you on the payroll while the\u0026nbspbusiness has less work than normal. While on furlough you cannot undertake work for or on behalf of your employer.Many shops, restaurants, hotels and other service industries in the UK have found themselves with no customers after being forced to close amid the pandemic, and many other firms have had work cancelled.Any employer with a UK payroll and a UK bank account will be able to claim on their employees’ behalf.Employees must have been on their employer’s payroll scheme and had this notified to HMRC\u0026nbspon or before 19 March.This means that people who work for businesses, charities and public authorities will be entitled to the money if their employer signs up.Employees can be on any type of contract, including zero-hours or temporary.If you were employed as of 28 February and on the payroll, but were made redundant or stopped working before 19 March, you can qualify for the scheme if your employer rehires you and puts you on furlough.Employers can backdate claims to when employees were first furloughed, with the earliest date being 1 March.Businesses will be able to pay their employees 80 per cent of their regular monthly wage, or £2,500 a month, whichever is lower.If on the scheme, your employer must pay you at least the 80 per cent of your usual income, however, they are also free to top this up if they wish.This means that if you earn £24,000 a year, you will earn a gross income of at least £1,600 a month on the furlough scheme.Once an employer has claimed, they will receive a claim reference number. HMRC will then check that the claim is correct and pay the claim amount by Bacs into the employer’s bank account within 6 working days.Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The primary international benchmark, Brent Crude, was more stable than America’s West Texas Intermediate, but still down 5.5 per cent to $26.70 (£27.60).Some of the price decline has been passed on to drivers with petrol prices in the UK dipping to 11p a litre over the past month, but the AA said retailers had been slow to deliver the benefits.Could coronavirus hasten the oil industry’s demise?Analysts from Goldman Sachs warned earlier this month that the coronavirus crisis was “extremely negative for oil prices and is sending landlocked crude prices into negative territory”.That will hurt the oil industries in North America and Russia most, due to the geology and location of supplies there, the Wall Street bank said. America’s fracking industry is widely forecast to suffer scores of bankruptcies this year as producers lose money when the oil price is low.Jeff Currie, Goldman’s global head of commodities research, said the pandemic would “permanently alter the energy industry and its geopolitics, restrict demand as economic activity normalises and shift the debate around climate change”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Most oil is traded via contracts based on its expected price on a future delivery date. May futures contracts are due to expire on Tuesday meaning traders are keen to offload them to avoid having to take physical delivery of oil and find a place to store it.Stuart Joyner, an energy specialist at Redburn, said: “The remarkable collapse in US crude prices is partly technical as we see funds position for the imminent contract expiry or ‘roll’.”However, he predicted prices over the summer reflect the fact that traders see storage capacity reaching its limits and are concerned about a longer-term reduction in oil demand.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That radio telescope – the largest in the world – is able to scan electromagnetic radiation and can help understand the chemical makeup of objects large and small elsewhere in the universe.The observations showed that gas was coming out of the comet that contained unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide. There was more of the chemical than had been found in any comet near the sun, and may have been 26 times higher than the average solar system comet.Comet visiting our solar system is \u0027like nothing seen before\u0027Usually, in comets found in our solar system, water is the most abundant molecule in the coma or gas cloud that surrounds them. But\u0026nbsp2IBorisov\u0026nbsphad as much as 1.7 times as much carbon monoxide as it did water, the scientists report.This is the first time we\u0027ve ever looked inside a comet from outside our solar system, said astrochemist Martin\u0026nbspCordiner in a statement.\u0026nbspAnd it is dramatically different from most other comets we\u0027ve seen before.Such comets are fascinating to scientists in part because they spend much of their time a long way from any star, in very cold environments. As such, their interior makeup is relatively untouched, and could provide an insight into what happened when they were born in the early history of their solar systems.In\u0026nbsp2IBorisov\u0027s case, scientists think it was kicked out from its home system, probably when it interacted with a passing star or planet. Since then, the cold environment intestellar space will probably have kept it preserved as it travelled on its way towards Earth, meaning that its makeup has probably remained as it was since its formation, possibly billions of years ago.Alongside the carbon monoxide (CO) found in the comet, there was also\u0026nbsphydrogen cyanide (HCN), scientists report in the new article published in Nature Astronomy. But researchers were less surprised by that discovery, since the HCN was found in roughly similar amounts to that in comets from our own solar system.Carbon monoxide is also expected to be present in such objects, but not in such high amounts. The unusual findings could offer an insight into the conditions that gave birth to the interstellar comet.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Its home could be similar to the cold area beyond Neptune in our own solar system, the Kuiper Belt, which is host to numerous icy objects.If the gases we observed reflect the composition of 2IBorisov\u0027s birthplace, then it shows that it may have formed in a different way than our own solar system comets, in an extremely cold, outer region of a distant planetary system, said\u0026nbspCordiner.The object known as\u0026nbsp2IBorisov\u0027s\u0026nbsparrived soon after the first known interstellar visitor, Oumuamua.

More than 1 million extra claims for Universal Credit have been received since the pandemic began.A report from the Resolution Foundation think tank forecast that as many as 11.7 million people could be furloughed or unemployed over the next three months, with those in the lowest-paid sectors worst affected.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Zuckerberg stressed that only those health researchers see the information from Facebook\u0027s respondents, and that it cannot access the results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers are getting around a million responses a week, he said, and the results are already tallying with other publically available data on cases. Facebook hopes the responses will therefore be reliable enough to predict the spread of the disease as well as give precise insights into how the disease is spreading by county.The results indicate, for example, that in some New York City suburbs, an estimated 2 to 3 percent of people are experiencing covid-19-like symptoms, he wrote in an article published in the Washington Post.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastMr Zuckerberg said Facebook can uniquely help researchers and promoted the role of social networks in generating such data. By distributing surveys to large numbers of people whose identities we know, we can quickly generate enough signal to correct for biases and ensure sampling is done properly, he said.As well as rolling out the survey globally, Facebook will build a tool that lets researchers everywhere access the results from the survey, he said. We’re hopeful that this will help governments and public health officials around the world who might not otherwise have this kind of precise data to make decisions in the weeks and months ahead, he wrote.Mr Zuckerberg said the company was also collaborating with universities, healthcare organisations and governments across the world to provide other help, such as artificial inteligence tools to try and predict needs for resources such as personal protective equipment.Despite Facebook\u0027s attempts to help with the coronavirus outbreak, it has been criticised for serving as a platform for a wide variety of misinformation and other problematic posts. The company has rolled out a series of responses to the virus, which have ranged from anti-misinformation campaigns to new product features that improve group video\u0026nbspchats.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Frustration that the pandemic we are living through was predictable and preventable,” Mr Jermey writes.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe blunt acknowledgement by Mr Jermey\u0026nbspcomes amid increasing anger at home and abroad over\u0026nbspfailures by national governments to prepare\u0026nbspadequately for\u0026nbspthe infectious disease, which has so far claimed more than 150,000\u0026nbsplives globally.\u0026nbsp​“Humanity’s relentless exploitation of wildlife has been putting us at increasing risk of an event like this for decades. And this knowledge has not been some big secret, despite the rhetoric from various world leaders claiming this pandemic couldn’t have been anticipated,” Mr Jermey writes.\u0026nbsp”The truth is, we knew this was coming.”The message would\u0026nbspappear relevant for successive Conservative governments, which\u0026nbsphave been accused of repeatedly ignoring warnings\u0026nbspwithin “pandemic preparedness” documents over the past decade.To minimise the risk of future pandemics, Mr Jermey\u0026nbspcalls for the international community to focus on better regulation of so-called “wet markets”, such as the one in Wuhan largely considered the epicentre of the outbreak, and a renewed battle against the “illegal and unsustainable” wildlife trade.\u0026nbspOf the latter, Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent and Evening Standard, wrote last week: “From the financing of terrorists like Al-Shabab to the propagation of corruption and smuggling groups, this demand has done untold damage to the African continent.

Following a quick check-up, the crew will be flown by helicopters to Baikonur, from where Skripochka will be taken to Moscow, said Vyacheslav Rogozhnikov, a Russian medical official who oversaw the crew\u0027s return.Morgan and Meir will have to be driven from Baikonur to Kyzyl-Orda, 190 miles away, to board a flight to the US - a strenuous journey made necessary by Kazakhstan\u0027s quarantine measures.On Thursday, the Russian government coronavirus headquarters reported the first contagion at the Star City, which serves as the main hub for pre-flight training of US, Russian and other international crew members of the International Space Station.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Researchers had previously mostly inferred the existence of planets through their effects on stars or their shadows as they moved in front of stars, but this suspected planet was seen through numerous years of observations from Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope.But astronomers now think that those observations were actually the result of two icy bodies smashing into each other. When they did, they left behind a cloud of fine dust particles that was visible through space – and it was that which was mistaken for another planet by astronomers on Earth, 25 light years away.Though the discovery means that the original discovery appears to have been mistaken, it also opens up an entirely new – and perhaps more surprising – kind of discovery, in seeing such a crash. The Hubble images might not show a planet but do show the aftermath of the suspect collision, allowing researchers a new phenomenon to research.Scientists find which exoplanets could host alien lifeThese collisions are exceedingly rare and so this is a big deal that we actually get to see evidence of one, said Andras Gaspar, an assistant astronomer at the University of Arizona\u0027s Steward Observatory and lead author of the new paper. We believe that we were at the right place at the right time to have witnessed such an unlikely event with NASA\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope.The discovery might help shine a light not on where planets exist – but how they stop existing, when they destroy each other.The Fomalhaut star system is the ultimate test lab for all of our ideas about how exoplanets and star systems evolve, said George Rieke, a Regents Professor of Astronomy at Steward Observatory. We do have evidence of such collisions in other systems, but none of this magnitude has been observed in our solar system. This is a blueprint of how planets destroy each other.The scientists – whose research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences – came to the conclusion after spotting a variety of unusual characteristics of the supposed exoplanet. The fact it could be seen in visible light was strange, given that any exoplanet should be too small to reflect enough light to be seen on the other hand, its heat could not be seen in infrared, but researchers expected any planet would be warm enough to shine that way.Initially, those supportive of the existence of the planet argued that it could have a shell or ring of dust surrounding it from a crash. But new images helped argue that the planet did not exist at all.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Before that, it had faded away.Clearly, Fomalhaut b was doing things a bona fide planet should not be doing, said Gaspar.Instead, the new paper proposes that the planet was actually the slowly expanding dust from a long ago collision that sent dust billowing into space. It gradually disappeared as the debris cloud expanded to be so large that it could no longer be seen, and scientists now suspect that it would be a size larger than the orbit of Earth around the Sun.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Eerie they look like satellites... Anyone know what they are?A website tracking UFO reports also received reports of aurora craft sweeping across the sky in straight lines.Elon Musk fears he will die before SpaceX makes it to MarsThe satellites are being launched in batches and will eventually create a 12,000-strong constellation for the ambitious space-based internet project.SpaceX is leveraging its experience in building rockets and spacecraft to deploy the world\u0027s most advanced broadband internet system, the company states on its website.With performance that far surpasses that of traditional satellite internet and a global network unbounded by ground infrastructure limitations, Starlink will deliver high speed broadband internet to location where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable.SpaceX\u0026nbspis among a number of private firms aiming to deliver the\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspto under-served areas of the globe using micro satellites, with online retail giant Amazon also planning its own network.Astronomers have warned that thousands of new satellites orbiting the Earth could risk ruining the view of the night\u0027s sky and interrupting radio frequencies used for observing the universe.Dr Dave Clements, an astrophysicist from Imperial College London, described the constellations\u0026nbsplast year as a tragedy that may even block sightings of Earth-bound asteroids.“They present a foreground between what we’re observing from the Earth and the rest of the universe, so they get in the way of everything,” he said. “And you’ll miss whatever is behind them, whether that’s a nearby potentially hazardous asteroid or the most distant Quasar in the universe.”Created with Sketch.Race to Space: US and Soviet Union\u0027s Cold War rivalry  Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.US astronaut Alan B Shepard Jr sitting in his Freedom 7 Mercury capsule, ready for launch on 5 May 1961.

We know in some cases it’s their only main meal for the day and they’re not able to get much else.How to support our campaign“I am seeing some scared elderly people on their own, so if I speak to them from the pavement, I’m just trying to reassure them and keep their spirits up,” he adds.Briana LeBold, 47, works in fashion production and was furloughed by her company soon after the lockdown began. She has been volunteering as a food delivery cyclist a few days a week.“I decided worrying about work isn’t going to change anything,” she says. “I thought what Made in Hackney and some of the food charities were doing was wonderful, so I just wanted to get involved to support the work.“There isn’t a huge amount of interaction with people, obviously, but they do let us know how much they’re enjoying the meals. Even if it’s just a wave and a ‘hi’ – it’s still really nice to see people and feel like you’re helping in some way.”Tais Lima, a 41-year-old yoga teacher, is volunteering one day a week. “I like getting out on my bike with a sense of purpose,” she says. “There’s a lot of lonely and vulnerable people out there, but it’s rewarding to see they’re getting a meal that changes their day.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her staff identified 420 iniduals and families in the London borough in dire need of food each day, and asked for volunteers to help drop off the vegan meals between 2pm and 6pm every afternoon.Kitchen staff at the Angelina restaurant in Dalston have helped with the cooking so they can meet a target of delivering 30,000 meals over the next three months.“We knew there was going to be this incredible level of need out there, so we ripped up our job descriptions and threw ourselves into this work,” says Ms Bentley. “It’s been pretty emotional at times, pretty intense to see what people are going through. We want to be able to help more people if we possibly can.”She told The Independent how one family had no food at all in the house for more than two days before they began getting daily meals out to them.One of those receiving a delivery each afternoon is David Pavlovic, a 63-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, who was told not to leave home for a 12-week period.“I’ve got family outside of London and friends across the city – but they have problems of their own with job losses,” he says.“I did get worried for a while about having enough food, so it was just a massive relief to get meals delivered.

Now, writes Mark Critchley,\u0026nbspthere are fears this gathering of more than 50,000 fans could prove to have been\u0026nbspa costly errorLittle more than a month ago, coronavirus was beginning to grip Britain. There were almost 600 cases, UK deaths were being counted and doctors in northern Italy were warning of the nightmare to come. But at Anfield on 11 March, more than 52,000 people made their way to Anfield to watch Liverpool’s\u0026nbspelimination from the Champions League at the hands of Atletico Madrid, sitting shoulder to shoulder in the stands.The crowd that night included 3,000 away supporters who had largely travelled from Madrid, despite the match coming a day after gatherings of more than 1,000 people had been banned in Spain.At that stage – before keeping two metres from the next person became a way of life – the UK government’s policy was that shutting down mass gatherings like the match at Anfield or the Cheltenham Festival, held the same week, would have only a minimal effect on limiting the spread of the coronavirus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEven in the days that followed, once the Premier League and Football League took matters into their own hands and suspended fixtures, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told journalists at No 10’s daily press briefing that banning mass gatherings was not a priority.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIt took until the following Monday – 16 March, five days after the game at Anfield and the World Health Organisation’s\u0026nbspdeclaration that humanity was in the grip of a pandemic – for Boris Johnson to finally advise against large-scale events. There were 12 confirmed cases of coronavirus on Merseyside at the time. Now, there are nearly 3,000, with 448 deaths recorded in the region’s hospitals.In light of those numbers and the growing nationwide death toll, it is only natural to ask whether the match at Anfield that night – the last match to be held in Britain with such a high attendance – should have gone ahead at all.For Ian Byrne, the Labour MP for West Derby, there’s no need for hindsight to see the incorrect decision was made – he says the warning signs were there all along. Byrne is a lifelong Liverpool supporter who would have attended the match if he had not been working in parliament. Instead, he gave his ticket to his son and – alongside fellow Merseyside MPs Dan Carden and Maria Eagle – worked to raise the issue with health secretary Matt Hancock in the House of Commons.“It was a massive, massive concern,” Byrne says, finding the presence of fans from an emerging coronavirus hotspot particularly baffling. At the time, 782 of Spain’s 1,646 cases were contained in the capital. “If we were playing in Madrid, they wouldn’t be able to attend. Suddenly they can all get on planes, come here without any hindrance, attend the game in the city and act like you would act, doing what you want to do and enjoying the event.”There is a sense warnings from elsewhere were not heeded either. Three weeks earlier, a Champions League game between Atalanta – a team from Bergamo, the epicentre of Italy’s crisis – and Valencia was played in Milan. The match has been described by Bergamo’s mayor as a “biological bomb” which accelerated the spread of the virus in Lombardy. “It was out there, the evidence was out there but it wasn’t getting listened to. We weren’t listened to,” says Byrne. “I just found it utterly infuriating.”On the evening of the game, Hancock responded to questions in the Commons by claiming that it was too easy to draw a link between crowds and contagion. “Sometimes the things that we, as lay people, may feel intuitively will have the biggest impact do not in fact have the biggest impact,” he said. “There are some things that feel right but do not have an impact at all.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut Sridhar Venkatapuram, of the Global Health Institute at King’s College London, can only politely describe the relaxed attitude towards mass gatherings during the early days of the crisis as “very interesting”, with a clear note of scepticism. “If we care about iniduals going out of their house, then 50,000 people coming together should worry us even more,” he says. “Concerts, sports matches, political rallies, pilgrimages: all these kinds of things intensify the frequency at which people will come into contact with each other and the rate at which the virus is infecting other people.“If there are 54,000 fans at a football stadium, I cannot tell you exactly where the greatest infections happen. I would be able to tell you that if you put two people together, it’s more likely the second person is going to be infected as opposed to one person being on their own. If one person is infected and surrounded by 10 people, it’s more likely that more than one other person is going to be infected.”And of course, football matches not only mean tens of thousands of fans shouting and cheering in close proximity to each other. They also involve them eating, drinking and socialising together in public spaces, then travelling together on public transport. “There’s nothing better than going to a European away game,” Byrne says. “Obviously the Spanish fans would have taken full advantage of the hospitality that Liverpool would have given them.”Venkatapuram believes that, by 11 March, the unnecessary risk of holding large events should have been clear. “Seeing a variety of patterns, seeing France, Italy and all these countries taking drastic steps, the UK should have been much more concerned about the health and wellbeing of its citizens and should have started to work on the big issues: should international travel be stopped? Should large gatherings of 50,000 people be stopped?”Those are questions that Byrne hopes will be answered by a future inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus crisis. “Hopefully once we all get through this and we can have a look at how it was handled and how we learn from it,” he says. And if\u0026nbspevidence emerges that events of 11 March contributed to Merseyside’s developing crisis, he wants the Anfield decision to be revisited. “That should be an absolute key part of any report.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In the four weeks since lockdown, they have delivered 565 tonnes – a staggering 1.35 million meals.This extraordinary humanitarian effort – carried out with 22 delivery vans manned by a small army of volunteers – comes in the wake of rising food poverty and worrying new research on unemployment. \u0026nbspThe Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex estimated at the weekend that at least 6.5 million jobs could be lost, a fifth of the national total, with the duration of the lockdown being critical as to whether job losses will be short-lived.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt comes on top of a YouGov poll for The Food Foundation revealing that 8 million people in Britain face food insecurity and that 3\u0026nbspmillion have already experienced hunger.As Felix scrambles to respond to the deepening distress with no government support, donations to our campaign, in conjunction with sister title the Evening Standard, are crucial to fund their fast-expanding operation.Today we can report a hugely generous donation from the Garfield Weston Foundation, who agreed to an emergency grant of £500,000 to be shared equally between The Felix Project and FareShare, London’s two biggest food surplus distributors, for their work supporting the most vulnerable families in the wake of the coronavirus.Our campaign raises over £1.5m for the vulnerablePhilippa Charles, director of the Garfield Weston Foundation, said: “Alongside significant grants to the National Emergency Trust among others, our trustees are keen to ensure that those most vulnerable and affected by this crisis receive the immediate support they need. We are delighted to support this partnership between two effective charities with which we have had long-standing relationships.”\u0026nbspAnother donor to our appeal, which is approaching £2m, was the Oso Foundation, whose trustee Karen Jankel, said: “Doing the weekly grocery shop may have its challenges for most of us, but at least we can afford to put food on the table. The ethos behind The Felix Project appeals to us as we hate the idea of waste and so by giving them our donation, we feel as though we’re making a small difference twice over.”On Friday, Felix delivered 16 truckloads of nutritious food to community hubs in eight boroughs –​ Barnet, Enfield, Haringey, Harrow, Havering, Islington, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest – and a further 26 truckloads to 75 charities, schools and holiday clubs. All in all, this is the daily equivalent tonnage of three-and-a-half double-decker Routemaster buses.With more borough hubs set to come on stream in the coming days, demand for their services is set to rise yet further.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help here.\u0026nbspFollow this link\u0026nbspto donate to our campaign in London, in partnership with the Evening Standard.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The initiative will be launched on Monday when the Hubb Community Kitchen plans to start cooking between 250 and 300 meals a day, three days a week.\u0026nbspThe scheme\u0026nbspfollows a Zoom conference call last week, when the duchess talked to women involved in running the kitchen about how they could adapt their service to feed people at a time when social-distancing rules prevent it from opening as normal. Much of the produce will be supplied by The Independent’s charity partner The Felix Project which sources surplus food from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMeghan said: “The spirit of the Hubb Community Kitchen has always been one of caring, giving back and helping those in need, initially in Grenfell and now throughout the UK.\u0026nbspA home-cooked meal from one neighbour to another, when they need it most, is what community is all about.”How to support our campaign“I’m so proud of the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen, and the continued support The Felix Project gives them to carry out these acts of goodwill, which at this moment are urgently needed.\u0026nbspI’m equally moved by the many people who are contributing to campaign to raise money for these vital organisations in the wake of Covid-19.”The meals will be prepared in the cooks’ homes and delivered by another charity, StreetGames, which runs the Fit And Fed campaign that aims to provide nutritious meals for children at risk of going hungry during the school holidays.The Duke of Sussex, who saw the charity’s work during a visit to one of its centres in Streatham last year, put it in touch with the kitchen.Harry and Meghan on Thursday\u0026nbspcompleted two days of volunteering with Project Angel Food in California, helping to deliver food parcels to people in need.The Hubb Community Kitchen was set up in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster in June 2017, when a group of local women gathered in a communal kitchen at the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre.The duchess first visited it in January 2018 and has continued to make regular private visits. She wrote the foreword for Together, a collection of the women’s own personal recipes from across Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mark Curtin, Felix’s chief executive, said: “The women of Hubb Community Kitchen have stepped up yet again in the face of a global pandemic.“We stand together with all of our partners to get food to people most at risk of experiencing hunger and malnutrition in this time of need.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in\u0026nbspThe Independent, said: “It is a pleasure to have the backing of the Duchess of Sussex for our campaign.\u0026nbspHer support for the survivors of the Grenfell fire is truly admirable.

This seems to be another sign of the Lords failing to meet the democratic standards voters expect.“The Commons has shown that broadcasting the mostly-virtual hearings is possible from Day one. It’s vital for democracy not to simply be done, but be seen to be done. Unfortunately, any kind of democracy is lacking in Britain’s out-dated second chamber. The Lords authorities must get to grips with this rapidly.”Here’s how parliament is going to meet ‘virtually’ for the first timeIt comes after news that some peers are lobbying the House of Lords to still pay them their £323 a day attendance allowance even if they only attend virtually. House authorities say only peers attending the palace in person will be able to claim.Mr Hughes of the ERS added: “It is jarring to see Lords lobbying to receive their full £323-a-day expenses - without voters being able to see what they’re doing with it. This will strike most people as tone-deaf when millions of workers have had to make sacrifices during this crisis.Commenting on the announcement of the virtual sittings, Lord Fowler, the Lord Speaker, said the virtual Lords will inevitably face some technical teething problems – perhaps explaining the decision not to broadcast the initial proceedings. The average age of peers in the unelected chamber is over 70.Under the plans for the virtual sittings, the Commons will sit Monday to Wednesday and Lords will sit Tuesday to Thursday, where both chambers will hold questions sessions and ministerial statements. The Lords is due to use Microsoft Teams and the Commons will use Zoom to allow them to conduct their business virtually.Both chambers were understood to have been given different briefs on what was required for parliamentarians, which led to different technology being applied in each House. The Commons was ordered to provide live broadcasts of proceedings by the government, hence the decision to use Zoom.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Participation in the virtual sittings of the House does not qualify for claiming attendance allowance.“It is expected that the Lords virtual proceedings will be broadcast from 5 May so there are likely to be only six days of Parliamentary business where the proceedings are not broadcast. On those days a Hansard transcript will be made available as soon as possible after the virtual business concludes, an audio recording will be published and journalists based in Parliament will be invited to view a livestream to inform their reporting.“Legislative business will continue to take place in the Chamber and be broadcast in the normal way.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This makes the estimation of the\u0026nbsptotal financial consequences difficult to calculate at this point.Parliament rose a week early for the Easter recess following concerns about the spread of coronavirus, with a number of MPs and staff affected.Under the new plans,\u0026nbspthe Commons and the Lords will only sit for three days a week, with question sessions in the lower chamber limited to two hours.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They’re also using mobile apps tied to payments, such as Amazon Prime Now, to place delivery or pickup orders for groceries. The Treasury Department may even let people who don’t have bank accounts receive their coronavirus relief checks via mobile-payment services like Venmo.“We shouldn’t be touching anything,” said Richard Crone, chief executive officer of mobile-payment research firm Crone Consulting. He expects contactless payments to grab an additional 10 per cent to 20 per cent of transactions at stores and ATMs as the result of the pandemic. Person-to-person services like PayPal, Venmo and Zelle should benefit as well, Mr Crone said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt’s easy to see why. Even with retail stores cleaning more often than ever – if they’re open at all – handling cash or touching payment keypads stands out as a major risk. With contactless pay, you link a bank account or credit card to your phone and then tap the device on a contactless reader or hover over it to trigger payment.Already, 27 per cent of US small businesses have seen an increase in customers using services like Apple Pay, according to a survey of 361 companies released in April by the Strawhecker Group and the Electronic Transactions Association. Publix Super Markets sped up its transition to contactless terminals because of Covid-19, according to the company. Starting in early April, consumers at all Publix stores have been able to use services like Apple Pay and Google Pay to check out.“I know a lot of merchants are putting signage up at the point of sale, ‘Please use contactless’,” said Linda Kirkpatrick, a Mastercard executive who works with banks and credit unions.Burger King released a commercial in March to encourage customers to use an order-ahead app to pay at drive-thrus.A couple of weeks ago, retail giant Walmart Inc. tweaked its self-checkout system to go completely contactless when shoppers use Walmart Pay. Previously, you had to touch a “Pay now” button after scanning your groceries. Now, you can read a QR code with your phone to pay. Use of pickup and delivery at Walmart is growing as well.A million doses of coronavirus vaccine could be available by September“You are seeing customers start to use services they weren’t interested in before,” said Molly Blakeman, a Walmart spokeswoman.Many sellers at farmers’ markets have stopped accepting cash, and are instead using apps like Venmo, which is owned by PayPal Holdings Inc. The app got it started as a way for friends to reimburse each other for dinner or for roommates to handle rent.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Earlier this week, Grubhub pulled its 2020 guidance, largely because of the acute situation in New York, where many restaurants have closed. Companies that serve ride-sharing companies, like Stripe and Adyen, may also suffer as usage declines.The industry’s established players are also facing new competition. In March, portable-reader heavyweight Square Inc. rolled out ways for its restaurant owners to offer pickup and delivery options.“We’ve seen so many folks pivoting to online to keep their businesses going,” said Katie Dally, a Square spokeswoman. Independent booksellers and other businesses are offering pickup and delivery too, she said.As more people embrace contactless technology and get used to paying that way, consumer behaviour is going to change for good, experts say.The rush delivery service at supermarket chain Safeway hit 670,000 weekly active US mobile users the week of 29 March, up from fewer than 50,000 in the week of 1 March, according to the analytics platform App Annie.

When it comes to health alarms, they rely on experts.It would take a very brave prime minister indeed to ignore the people appointed to safeguard the nation’s health when lives are at risk.And the advice from those experts — the sprawling Public Health England in particular — was that Britain faced no more than a larger-than-usual dose of winter flu.PHE was against German-style mass testing and, when caught flat-footed, rejected help from commercial laboratories in providing those tests.PHE failed to build stocks of personal protective equipment — including masks, gowns and gloves — despite a  test run showing these were a priority.PHE dragged its feet over sourcing ventilators for intensive-care patients and extra hospital beds.Frequently when running short of crucial gear, PHE resisted offers of outside help, leaving the NHS scrambling to catch up.And when it came to opening London’s ,-bed Nightingale emergency hospital, it was the Army that did the job in nine days.It was also PHE who insisted the British public would be protected by “herd immunity”.The sooner  per cent of the population had contracted the virus and become immune, the better, it said.Boris faithfully followed their lead until another expert, Prof Neil Ferguson, issued a nightmare prediction of , dead unless Britain was locked up overnight.It was Ferguson who in the Blair years forecast mass burials on the scale of the Great Plague during the “Mad Cow” scare and the foot-and-mouth outbreak.Neither Armageddon scenario came remotely close.Once this is over and the inevitable inquiry is held, Boris and his government will inevitably be in the dock.So will PHE, a fiercely territorial quango with a giant £.billion budget.Much of this goes on pay and perks for well-cushioned executives, with  staff on six-figure salaries — a nanny-state rich list.Its website boasts its job is to “protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing”.And yet this box-ticking bureaucracy — obsessed with sugary drinks and ersity — has failed at the first hurdle.It shares with the higher reaches of the NHS a suspicion of fleet-footed commercial rivals and deep-seated hostility to the “profit motive”.Criticism, still muted, is widespread within the medical community, including frontline doctors and consultants.Every Thursday at pm, a grateful nation stands and applauds NHS staff working around the clock to save lives at the risk of their own.The same cannot be said for the inflexible, politically correct quango that binds the hands of medical staff in the name of an outdated socialist credo on health provision: State good, private bad.Much will need to change after Covid-. And that change must start with Public Health England.MINISTERS are looking at a traffic-light system to lt lockdown. Red for Stop, green for Go, with amber in between.Overzealous cops and councils are being reined in. ­Common sense is taking over. Families can now attend funerals.We might be able to say goodbye to dying ­relatives. Parks will reopen to the ­public. Benches have been deemed safe to sit on.So how about allowing non-contact sporting activities that boost both physical and mental health Swimming pools are surely safe.

Why not where The thousands of coronavirus mutual aid groups could make enough homemade masks for everyone, so it would cost next to nothing.Instructions are easily available, for example, at masksall.org.uk.A petition has also been started by MasksAll urging the Government to make masks mandatory in the UK.The medics are advising people make reusable cotton masks from simple items you can find in your house, such as scarves or towels.They say that doing this would not detract from surgical masks for the NHS and other key workers.The group say they have been inspired by action taken in other countries that have introduced face masks at population level, such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria.In particular, they point out that the German city of Jena saw new cases of coronavirus flatline since it brought in compulsory masks on April .Jon Fluxman, a retired GP, who is backing the campaign told Theit was “striking how countries who adopted masks-for-all are doing so much better than we are”.Dr Fluxman cited the Covid- lead doctor in South Korea, which on Saturday had less than ten new cases, “who is very clear that masks-for-all works”.Martin Yuille, Professor of Virology at Manchester University and backer of MasksAll, added that a mask offered “the possibility of an exit strategy”.Currently, the World Health Organisationsays only people who are showing symptoms or caring for coronavirus patients should wear them.However, WHOs main adviser David Heymann recently said he believeswearing a mask is equally effective or more effective than distancing.A review is set to be carried out tomorrow as to whether Brits should be ordered to wear a face mask in public.Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty recently confirmed that discussions about public use of face masks were a very live issue.He added: What we are really trying to do is to work out under what circumstances,any, should we extend the advice.Former Prime Minister Tony Blair today warned that people will only get back to workmade to wear masks.Mr Blair said it would need a massive effort to mass produce masks for people before they can head back to offices.He said: “I can’t believe people will be going back to work without wearing masks. You are going to need mass production of that.”The former Labour PM added that the coronavirus outbreak is “the most dficult and complicated challenge I have ever seen in politics.”London Mayor Sadiq Khan has also called for Londoners to wear face masks outside - including on public transport.Mr Khan told BBC Radio : The point Im making to Government experts and to Government is I think advice should change.Advice should change so in those circumstances where its not possible to keep social distancing - think of public transport, think of when you re in a shop - we should use non medical facial covering like bandanas, like scarves, like reusable masks.Mr Khan stressed wearing masks should not replace social distancing, but should be used where people are still having to leave home to go to work.He added medical grade personal protective equipment should be reserved for health professionals, becauseused wrongly it can be counter-productive.Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that members of the public wearing masks risked increasing shortages for NHS staff on the front line.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealProfessor Whitty said he remained concerned that advising the public to wear masks could lead to shortages.NHS heroes fighting on the frontline against coronavirus say theyve been forced to buy their own protective equipment from DIY stores.And data from the NHSppe app, created to track shortages of PPE, found that  per cent of doctors lacked the correct gowns for high risk procedures.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our Government has got it completely the wrong way around.”He also said mass testing was the way forward and the lack of contact tracing had “completely failed” elderly people.Professor Heneghan added: “Why did the scientic advisers say to abandon mass testing and contact tracing “We can see it worked for other countries like Germany and South Korea, so why “If it was about resources – look at what Germany did. It devolved responsibility, getting universities and healthcare sites to carry out tests.“We centralised it. But that was always going to be impossible for million people in the UK.“We have failed the elderly – care home and healthcare workers needed to be tested and isolated.”However, virologist Lena Einhorn has slammed Sweden’s coronavirus policy and described it as a “huge failure”.She told the Observer: “They have to admit that it’s a huge failure, since they have said the whole time that their main aim has been to protect the elderly.“But what is really strange is that they still do not acknowledge the likely route.“They say it’s very unfortunate, that they are investigating, and that it’s a matter of the training personnel, but they will not acknowledge that presymptomatic or asymptomatic spread is a factor.”Meanwhile, the Culture Secretary today said the coronavirus lockdown could remain partly in place for a total of three months.Oliver Dowden said this morning that Boris Johnson had stressed back in March he expected the country to be able to turn the tide in  weeks - and that appears to be what is happening.And he added that the PM was worried about lting the lockdown restrictions too early and was cautious about changing them.Mr Dowden told Radio : The PM is very concerned about a second peakwe lt the restrictions too soon.And when askedthe lockdown would be wound back at the start of next month, as some recent reports suggest, he replied: We said right at the beginning of this and the Prime Minister said he expected this peak to last around three months.Whats happened is kind of consistent with that.OtherThe Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealTo receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

such as whether youre in a couple, or have children.How much your allowance is depends on a range of factors including your income, and total assets - both of which can be changed by payments from previous employers such as holiday pay or last pay cheques.Any income or earnings will affect how much Universal Credit you will be entitled to.This is what is known as the taper rate - where p is deducted from your benefit payment for every £ you earn over a certain amount.Most people have a certain amount they can work every month without getting cash taken off from their benefits.If youre not receiving help for housing that allowance is £ a month.If you do get housing help, the allowance is lower - £.UC will take into account what comes in every month, and will adjust your payment according to what you get paid.Your income can be anything from earnings for paid work - this will include any holiday pay paid out by employers after you leave.Soyou have a large last pay cheque, you might not be entitled to anything for the first month youre out of work.Last pay cheques paid to you instead of your notice period will also be counted as income when calculating your Universal Credit payments.If your employer pays you back for expenses made while you were working there, that will affect your allowance.And bonuses will count too. Many people are complaining that they are having to wait in queues of up to , people just to get on to the website.But DWP has revealed when its website is quietest to help those applying or checking for updates.To make an account, youll need an email address and a phone number.After that, youll need to answer a set of questions about your current circumstances, known as your to do list.These include things like when you last received payment for a job, what your household income is and how many people depend on you financially.If youve lost your job, Citizens Advice recommends that you dont apply until youve received your final wages or any final holiday pay.This is because any money you receive after youve applied for Universal Credit will count as income and mean that youre entitled to less in your first payment.You will then need to confirm your identity online.In certain circumstances, youll be able to apply over the phone, such as those who dont have regular access to the internet, are visually impaired, or have a physical condition that stops you from using a computer or smartphone.To do this, you will need to contact the Universal Credit helpline to askyou can apply by phone or arrange a home visit.In this case, someone can call them on your behalfyou cant do it yourself.If your capital - or total assets - including stocks and savings, is over £, your UC allowance will be reduced.For every £, or any part of £, you have over £, your Universal Credit will reduce by £. in the assessment period.Soyou have savings of £, - your allowance will be reduced by £..If you are married or live with your partner, you have to apply together, and their capital will also be counted.If you have more than £, in savings, you wont be eligible for Universal Credit.Redundancy payouts are not treated as income and therefore are not subject to the taper rate.But they are counted in your total assets - sothey take you over the £, mark it can impact how much your monthly payment is.Any repayments of income tax or National Insurance contributions will be treated as earningsyou were still in paid work in the tax year the repayment relates to.If you werent in paid work - it will be counted in your total assets, rather than earnings, and your payment likely wont change.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront -

That is now empty as they are renting a £million mansion in Los Angeles.The couple said there would be “zero co-operation” with any newspapers other than their favoured media organisations.Their outburst came hours before Philip said he wanted to recognise the “vital and urgent” medical and scientic work taking place to battle the deadly virus.Sources said their statement — sent from an official “Sussex Royal” email — had also caused “private dismay” within the family, who are working hard to tackle issues surrounding the pandemic.Philip, who retired from public duties in , thanked Britain’s key workers in his statement.He said: “As we approach World Immunisation Week, I wanted to recognise the vital and urgent work being done by so many to tackle the pandemic.“By those in the medical and scientic professions, at universities and research institutions, all united in working to protect us from Covid-.On behalf of those of us who remain safe and at home, I also wanted to thank all key workers who ensure the infrastructure of our le continues.“The staff and volunteers working in food production and distribution, those keeping postal and delivery services going, and those ensuring the rubbish continues to be collected.” px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-GRAPHIC-PG.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" The Duke’s statement follows a moving address to the nation by the Queen,  today, who called for the country to unite in the crisis.William and Kate have also made a number of public appearances, including opening the Nightingale hospitals.But yesterday there was fury at Harry and Meghan’s decision to ban The Sun, Mirror, Mail and Express from covering future events.It was announced hours before court papers were filed in support of Meghan’s case for privacy against the Mail on Sunday over a letter it published from her to her father Thomas Markle. Part of the case will be heard on Friday.The couple, now living , miles away in LA, came under fire for making the announcement while the UK is coping with the rising coronavirus death toll.Harry, , and Meghan, , said in their -word statement they will only engage with news organisations not on their blacklist.It was sent to anti-monarchist newspaper— which is not on their banned list.The statement said the couple would work with grassroots, regional and local media and up-and-coming journalists.Society of Editors chairman Ian Murray called their actions censorship and said they are setting an “unfortunate example”.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.He added: “They may have been stung by some of the coverage they have not liked, they may disagree strongly with some elements of that coverage and can of course take action to answer any criticism they consider unfair or inaccurate through several channels.But the answer should never be to attempt to shun inidual titles and their millions of readers.”The papers blacklisted account for two-thirds of all national newspaper readership in the UK.Media and royal watchers blasted the couple for making the announcement at the height of the coronavirus crisis with the pair now living in an £million mansion near Elton John.Prince Charles’s biographer Tom Bower said: “The Sussexes have become their own worst enemies.

The pace will be very gradual.While a few restrictions may be eased next month, such as allowing some smaller shops to reopen, the PM’s official spokesman yesterday confirmed there will be no “wholesale” lting of them.There are also plans being drawn up to toughen them in areas where the virus’s spread is still alarmingly high.One Whitehall source said yesterday there are “three dferent epidemics right now”, where the virus is spreading at dferent rates – slower in the wider community, but faster in care homes and in hospitals.Two scenarios thought likely by insiders now are schools only ing at the earliest after the half-term break on June .But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe other is many people being asked to still work from home into the summer too so crowded public transport can still be avoided.The latest government thinking comes despite the spiralling damage lockdown is doing to the economy.After it emerged recuperating Boris Johnson himself has deep fears about ending the lockdown prematurely, the PM’s official spokesman said: “The big concern is a second peak. That is ultimately what will do most damage to health and the economy.“If you move too quickly, the virus will start to spread exponentially again.“Lting social distancing measures wholesale, could lead to the virus spreading exponentially again.”The quad of senior ministers in charge of the coronavirus fight in the PM’s absence have tasked the tasked Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesto try to work out how the Covid- transmission rate is affected by the easing of dferent measures.SAGE meets again today, chaired by Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, but it is expected to be “several weeks” before enough data is gathered to provide an accurate assessment.As well as their .am meeting, the quad – Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock – also now meet at pm daily to discuss the exit strategy.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden also said spectator sports events would not be allowed to reopen any time soon, with stadiums now likely to be closed until the Autumn at least.He said: “You wouldn’t expect us to permit mass gatherings at a first stage”.Mr Dowden dubbed easing restrictions too early as “the worst thing we could possibly do” as a second peak would send the country “right back to square one again”.That would spark the need for “potentially even more draconian measures”, he added.Mr Dowden went on: “We said right at the beginning of this, and the Prime Minister said, he expected the peak to last around three months.“What’s happened is consistent with that.”It emerged yesterday that Britain’s coronavirus strategy is now closest to France’s, which has a similar infection path.On Sunday night, French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe announced that cafes and restaurants will remain closed for months and masks are likely to become mandatory on public transport.While saying supermarkets can reopen next month, Mr Phillipe added: “Our le from May  will not be like our le before, not immediately, and probably not for a long time.Well have to learn to live with the virus.Former Chancellor Philip Hammond tonight warned he expects Britain will suffer a “U shaped” Covid economic slowdown.And he urged ministers to spell out to businesses how they may ease the lockdown to help the economy bounce back as best it can.He told a Chatham House webinar: “I think those forecasting a V shape recovery are probably erring on the side of optimism.“I suspect it is more likely that it will be something of a U-shape recovery.But there is no doubt in my mind that how steep the recovery slope is will depend on how well business to respond when the government gives the signal, and how soon the government is able to give that signal.”Mr Hammond said it feels like the Brits have been “anesthetised to the economic consequences” of coronavirus because of the jumbo bailouts the Treasury have ordered.But as the death toll goes down, the public will demand the government focuses on saving the economy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Unions warned over the weekend that without proper equipment its members may decide it is not safe enough to carry out certain tasks. Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefing, Professor Yvonne Doyle, the medical director for Public Health England, said: “Certainly people have to make their decisions based on whether they are in a risky situation or not,” she said. “It is very dficult to legislate for all of that from a distance here. But the guidance is very clear on what is safe and not safe to do.” She also insisted the advice to healthcare workers over PPE remained the same despite PHE telling doctors and nurses to consider reusing single-use masks, gowns and visors or to look for alternative equipment, when treating Covid- patientsstock runs dangerously low She said: “The guidance remains exactly the same. “What has happened over the weekend is to cover people really and given them some security in exceptional circumstances, advice has been produced jointly with the NHS about how to be safe in circumstances where supplies may be at risk. “And that is a very precautionary set of advice – it’s quite the opposite to putting people at risk because there aren’t enough supplies. “It’s trying to ensure that people are well secured and safe when there may not be enough supplies, and it also stresses how important it is not to take risks and when it is not right to do certain things and practices with the PPE.”This evening the Chancellor Rishi Sunak revealed that , gowns arrived from Myanmar today.But a planned shipment of  tonnes of PPE from Turkey was delayed over the weekend. An RAF plane took off this evening to airlt the vital equipment.  No said there had been “unexpected delays” but stressed the UK was receiving supplies from other countries as well as from within Britain. Earlier, NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson outlined the health serviceaposs lack of confidence in promised supplies arriving. He told the BBC: We know from bitter experience over the last few weeks that actually we can only guarantee that gowns are going to reach the front line when they actually landed on UK soil, the boxes have actually been opened and checked and they have then been safety tested. But while , gowns due from Turkey would be welcome, NHS staff were getting through approximately , gowns a day, he warned.  What we really need to get to is from the current rather hand-to-mouth approach to where sustainable supplies consistently and reliably arrive, he added. Palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke said NHS and social care workers were being told to wear skimpy little plastic aprons. She added: They donapost cover your arms, and your neck and the top of your chest, theyaposre not covered either. That means youaposre at an increased risk of catching coronavirus and - crucially - at increased risk of spreading it to your patients. We are using a pinny essentially - a skimpy, plastic pinny. Health firm Landcent said it had , Italian-made PPE protective suits ready to ship immediately. Co-founder Arun Prabhu said: “We’re supplying rapid test kits, coveralls, masks etc across Europe and are increasing our capacity constantly. “We understand the urgency in the UK and are prepared to address these needs on priority. “There is no reason whatsoever for the NHS to go short with PPE equipment as the global suppliers we work with can and are meeting the increase in demand due to coronavirus.” Ministers have appointed a “PPE tsar”, former London  Olympics chief executive Lord Paul Deighton, to unleash the potential of UK industry to scale up domestic PPE manufacturing.

Contact tracing involves tracking down as many people as possible who have come into contact with a person confirmed to have caught Covid-. Mr Hunt said contact tracing should be the UK’s next “national mission.” In an online video, he said: “The countries that have had the biggest success in keeping coronavirus deaths low are places like Korea and Germany that haven’t just done a lot of testing, they’ve used the data from testing to track down people who’ve had the virus, people they’ve been in contact with and isolate and quarantine them as well. “Andwe are going to use the extra capacity that we now have in testing, which is so welcome, this is the way to do it.”  He said such a programme could be undertaken nationally through Public Health England or locally through local councils. And he said consideration should be given to “feet on the ground” methods of tracing as well as technology like smartphone apps. Mr Hunt also suggested the government could lt the lockdown in areas with “low transmission” in order to test the contact tracing system without undermining the national lockdown messages. Urging the government to appoint a single person to head up the project, Mr Hunt said: “There are lots of people who can do this, but I hope we will get a move on so that the cabinet has a choice to the current national lockdown when they come to review this decision in just under  weeks time.” The World Health Organisation’s advice on lting lockdown measures recommends that a country must have the capacity to detect, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at the Commons health committee on Friday that the government is working “incredibly hard” to develop a way to do this. We do need to have comprehensive test, track and trace in place as soon as possible, he said. And we need to get the technology right, we need to have the people and weaposre building that resource and obviously we need to have the testing and weaposre ramping that up as well. So we do need to have all three of those in place and weaposre working incredibly hard to make sure that we are.

It came after government ministers came under increasing fire for allowing Liverpoolaposs Champions League match against Athletico Madrid to go ahead, despite warnings that events could be spreading the virus. Earlier today the government faced similar criticism over the decisions to let the Cheltenham Festival go ahead. Deputy chief scientic adviser Professor Dame Angela McLean said it was an interesting hypothesis that Liverpool hosting a football match against Atletico Madrid could have spread coronavirus. Asked about the game on March , she said: The question youaposve raised has to be put into context of the general policy at the time. When normal le was under way going to a football match was not a particularly large extra risk, she said. However, when you get to the situation of our strange lives as we live them now where we spend all our time basically at home, of course you wouldnapost add on an extra risk of lots and lots of people going off to the same place at the same time, she continued. I think it will be very interesting to see in the future when all the science is done what relationship there is between the virus that has circulated in Liverpool and the virus that has circulated in Spain. Thataposs certainly an interesting hypothesis you raise there. The Chancellor defended the Government for not having introduced a ban on large sporting events sooner.

The Chancellor added: At this stage of the crisis we are absolutely focused on sticking to the guidance.Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirrorThe UK should be able to ease stringent social distancing measures when five separate measures are met. These are that the NHS can continue to cope that the daily death rate continues to fall that the rate of infection also falls that operational challenges have been met, and most importantly that there is no risk of a second peak, Mr Sunak said. Referring to the Governmentaposs five tests Mr Sunak said: We are not there yet and it is very clear that, for now, what we should focus on is following the guidance, staying home to protect the NHS. Anything  that people might be speculating on is wrong, we are crystal clear on that message.  Prof Angela McLean, Deputy Chief Scientic Adviser, told the press conference that the number of new cases has stopped rising and is now pretty much stable and flat. However, it is unclear whether the daily death rate is likely to fall continuously over the coming days. The Government is also concerned that there may be a second peak in terms of infections. Earlier today the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: The big concern is a second peak. That is what ultimately will do the most damage to health and the most damage to the economy.

Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said there was #xCrelatively low confidence#xD that a shipment of , surgical gowns which had been due to arrive in the UK from Turkey on Sunday would make its way into the country on Monday.

Little Paton McGuire is currently being treated in the maternity unit at  University Hospital Wishaw having tested positive for the deadly bug.The Daily Record report that the tiny child is hooked up to machines in an incubation unit, the tiny tot is one of many Covid- patients being treated by dedicated NHS staff at the hospital.Her worried mum Tracy McGuire has taken the decision to isolate with her daughter while she is cared for. Speaking to the BBC, Tracy heaped praise on the nurses and doctors putting themselves in harmaposs way to look after Paton.  She said: I can’t thank them enough for what they’ve done for her. “Definitely privileged to have such a great team behind her and cheering her on. They have been brilliant. “Obviously staff now are absolutely risking their lives by looking after her and let’s not forget that, as cute and and beautul as she is, she has tested positive. The staff that are handling her are being put at risk. The North Lanarkshire maternity unit is usually a hive of activity, with excited new parents welcoming their babies into the world all day and all night.  Now empty, mums and dads of children kept in for observation are only allowed an hour a day visitation under strict measures. Hospital bosses have also taken the decision to split the ward into two - no-body is allowed to cross the ide - in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. Paton is one of many youngsters being treated at the site, with another mum revealing she had to be separated from her child for an agonising  days. She said: The last thing you want to hear when you pick up the phone is ‘your baby has coronavirus’. “I couldn’t sleep, it was so hard. It was so hard. Honest to god, the [doctors and nurses] have been a treat. They deserve a medal, each and every one of them.  But young babies arenapost the only vulnerable patients needing treatment at the site, with medics tending to everyone from care home staff to pensioners over the age of . Some have been spending up to three weeks at the former Wishaw General. Itaposs led to overwhelmed staff having to admit patients from three dferent entrances to be able to see them quicker under intense pressure - the hospitalaposs intensive care unit is currently working at quadruple capacity.

It is one of just  such sites across the UK – and we discovered similar disturbing scenes at many others. Experts say testing is key to easing the lockdown but critics warn the drive-throughs are too far away with many exhausted, stressed workers forced to travel “hundreds of miles”. A total , Covid- tests have been done to date and there were another  hospital deaths yesterday, taking the toll to , – but the actual number is likely to be higher.Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror And with nine days left for the Government to honour its vow, testing capacity is at % of its target. Just , of , available tests were taken up in the  hours to am on Sunday – , at drive-throughs. And , were done on Sunday, despite capacity for almost double. Last week, capacity had reached ,. No blamed new processes in commercial laboratories for the “small dip”, which it said was temporary. But Unison head of health Sara Gorton said: “It’s no surprise take-up has been low. The test centres aren’t always near where staff live or work and long trips in the car aren’t an option when someone is poorly. “People also need to be tested within days of the onset of symptoms. If more staff are to be tested, the Government has got to make it easier.”  Acting Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: “Ministers have over-promised and under-delivered on testing. “Their target of , tests per day still seems light years away, given that many frontline workers are hundreds of miles from the nearest testing centre. “We must learn lessons from nations like Germany and South Korea, where testing on a massive scale is in place. Lockdown cannot be lted, even partially, until there is a reliable, UK-wide testing system run locally.” But the PM’s spokesman insisted: “We do think we are on course to hit the target of ,.” The Government is under pressure to spell out its lockdown exit plan. It says rules will not be eased until there is no risk of a second peak. Some small firms could reopen in mid-May but travel would still be discouraged. Testing and contact-tracing is the “most promising approach” to helping lt the lockdown, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development says.  The body said isolating victims and tracing contacts so they also quarantine, which the Government abandoned early on, is key to controlling outbreaks. Promises made nearly a month ago that home tests would soon be available to the public on the high street or Amazon have yet to be delivered on. Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said: “Testing and contact-tracing is a vital tool in our response to this virus. Ministers have promised us , tests a day by the end of the month and it’s crucial they now outline a national testing strategy.” Mr Davey added: “We will have to use test, trace and isolate. But without knowing who does and doesn’t have Covid-, we can’t protect ourselves from a second wave.” When we visited Chessington, it was empty. We did not see a single car in the first  minutes and the only sound was the odd laugh from  or so masked staff with nothing to do. The centre in Surrey shut for lunch and by pm there was a steady stream of perhaps  cars arriving. The staff quickly saw them through the procedure but then it was quiet again. One worker said: “It’s usually like this, busy for a short while then periods when no one comes.”  A sign at the entrance warned: “Appointment only. Show email confirmation. No appointment, no entry.” There were also empty centres in Cardf, Brighton, Manchester, ­Gateshead and Salford. The PM’s spokesman admitted: “The demand anticipated from NHS staff and their families has not materialised.” More than , NHS and social care staff and their ­families have been tested so far. The Government last week widened the regime to include police, firefighters, prison officers and judges and their ­families – defined as the people the key workers are in ­lockdown with. Our handling of testing does not compare well with other nations. As Covid- spread across the world,  German labs carried out an average of , swab tests a day in the week ending April . Some Asian countries previously hit by similar viruses pursued a “test-trace-isolate” strategy. South Korea, which has had fewer than  deaths, was testing nearly , a day by mid-March – more people per head of population than anywhere . And on March , World Health Organisation director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “We have a simple message – test, test, test.” However,  days later England’s deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jenny Harries, threw doubt on it, saying: “The WHO ... is addressing all countries, with dferent health infrastructures.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jaguar land rover furloughs half","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Jaguar Land Rover furloughs half of entire UK staff amid crisisThe vehicle manufacturer said , staff have been furloughed from roles that \"are not critical during this temporary period of disruption\"ShareCommentsByBen Perrin:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsThe vehicle manufacturer said , staff has been furloughed \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Researchers at the University of South Walescreated a portable device to go with the super-quick test preventing the need for samples to be taken to a laboratory. The technology is already being evaluated by health chiefs and could be used in its care homes within weeks. The test, which has been described as low cost and quick, uses a dferent method and chemicals to the current accredited tests, avoiding any supply bottlenecks for the components. In just over a week the USW researchers, led by Dr Jeroen Nieuwland and Dr Emma Hayhurst, adapted a technique that they have been developing since  for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections.Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirrorDr Emma Hayhurst said: The really exciting thing is the potential for this technology to be used even wider than with healthcare workers. Our test could be used to help ramp up large scale community testing, running potentially hundreds of samples a day in our lab alone, with a much shorter turnaround time that the current method. It could also be developed for point of care which would, for example, offer a solution to people who perhaps live and work in more rural areas.  The test could also be used in other care settings and industries to help detect and prevent further spread of the virus. Crucially it is an affordable device which is simple to use, which should hopefully open up the options available for its use. Over the past week a number of NHS staff members who reported having symptoms were asked to provide two swabs – one for the accredited Public Health Wales test and one for the new USW test – to confirm the accuracy and performance of the underlying molecular technology. The preliminary results suggest a strong correlation between the tests. Researchers have said the molecular technology lends itself to point-of-care testing because no complex sample processing or expensive equipment is required.  The USW approach uses a swabbing and sample extraction technique which reduces cross-contamination and biosafety issues, and reduces the time taken to process the results. The team already have already developed a prototype device which costs less than £ to manufacture. This means that an affordable, mobile testing and analysis kit could shortly be available, allowing results to be available in just - minutes. Dr Nieuwland said: We have been developing our diagnostic testing  for the last few years, so we know that it works well for other infections such as urine tract infections. It was designed to be a simple, quick and cost effective test which is suitable for the diagnosis of a range of infections, so our work over the last few years has enabled us to quickly switch it to detect the underlying virus for Covid-.

In February authorities in the country signalled that the consumption and farming of wild animals would be banned on a temporary basis.The proposal followed the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in a wet market in the city of Wuhan.Although most researchers familiar with the virus and trade have suggested pangolins and bats are the source of the Covid- strain, at least one scientist has suggested bamboo rats are to blame.Do you have an unusual coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirrorReferred to as aposzhu shuapos in Mandarin, the large rodents have distinct round cheeks and are considerably sizeable. An adult bamboo rat can weigh five kilograms and grow to  centimetres long. Their heft and signature taste has earned them a place at the heart of Chinese cuisine for thousands of years. The rodents were a favoured dish in the Zhou Dynasty, which ran from  to BC, and are rumoured to help improve spleen . While the rats have long remained a minor part of Chinese culinary culture, they were shot into the limelight in  when two young men started videoing themselves breeding the rodents. The Nua Nong Brothers gave the unusual mammals a brand boost with recipe videos that attracted millions of views.  Their work inspired a nation and led the topic apos reasons to eat bamboo ratsapos to trend on Weibo. The rising popularity has also seen their value soar, with a pair of bamboo rats selling for the equivalent of £. When the ruling Communist Party put the brakes on the wild animal market in China, there were thought to be around million bamboo rats being reared for food.Many of these were in the south of the country in areas such as Guangzi, where there are thought to be , people raising million of the rodents, China News Weekly reports. One month before the industry came to a halt Dr Zhong Nanshan, Chinaaposs leading epidemiologist, warned that the epidemic may be linked to bamboo rats or badgers.  If more evidence pins the blame on the large rodent, then they may remain outlawed in the long term. While this might be welcomed by those looking to avoid another pandemic, it will likely prove costly for bamboo rat farmers. Regional governments such as the Guangxi Poverty Alleviation Office have promoted farmers raising the rodents on small holdings, with as much as  yuanavailable in subsidies for each animal. That compares with  yuanfor a chicken. It is estimated that , people in China have been lted out of poverty by rearing bamboo rats.Last month, several breeders in the county of Dongyuan, Guangdong, culled more than , bamboo rats in a desperate measure to limit their financial losses, Beijing News reported.

Lionel Vytialingam was buying food when he heard car horns and saw a small terried dog weaving in and out of traffic in Ipoh, Malaysia. He jumped in his car and followed the abandoned dog until he was able to get close enough to approach the animal. Lionel saw the dog had a soggy note attached to its collar with a rubber band, but didnapost try to retrieve it until he had gained its trust. After about  minutes, the dog plucked up the courage to approach him and Lionel carefully removed the note, while holding on to her apossticky knots of furapos, hoping it contained the owneraposs contact details or an address. Instead, he found a heartbreaking message which read: Woof! Hi! My name is Siggy and Iaposm the most loving and attentive doggy youaposll ever see. My master is very sorry he had to leave me here with you, but he just canapost look after me anymore. I am very sorry about that as Iaposm sure he is too. Please take me into your home. Please let me be part of your family. Please love me. I am a goldendoodle, I am five years old this year and I have not been neutered. I am very nice, I havenapost bitten anyone, ever! I am a good guard dog who will sit in front of your door all day, and bark at anyone who comes to your gate. Until you tell me to stop. OrI know the person very well. I can do some tricks too! I hope youaposll accept me. With love and some woof, Siggy.  The note left Lionel in tears and he decided to take the poor pup home, where he fed and bathed her, dried her off and let her sleep in a cosy bed he created under the safety of his sofa. His previously adopted dog Sammo didnapost get along with Siggy, so Lionelaposs brother is taking care of him while Lionel and Siggy stay in temporary accomodation. Lionel said: She had formed the most intense, most pleading eye contact with me from under her matted fringe. I unhooked the note, opened it up and read it right there crouched by the roadside. I broke down in tears.

It is claimed that she is now “the most important figure” in the oppressive regime. Her sudden rise to power hasn’t surprised insiders after she last month called South Korea a “frightened dog barking” following her countryaposs recent live-fire military exercise.  Youngshik Bong, a researcher at in Seoul’s Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies, told: “It is revealing that Kim Jong-un permitted her to write and announce a scathing statement about South Korea in such a personal tone.“He is clearly ready to allow his sister to become his alter ego.” Kim Yo-jong is learning quickly and many expect her to step up with questions over the -year-oldaposs health being asked on a daily basis.Leonid Petrov - a North Korea specialist and senior lecturer - added: “She has direct access to and strong influence on Kim Jong-un. “She is not associated with his purges or military brinkmanship, but knows all about them. “She is a trusted political figure who helps Kim maintain a positive public image when he is dealing with foreigners or South Koreans.” Kim Jong Unaposs absence from an important anniversary event last week fueled speculation over his potential health problems. A spokeswoman at Seoul’s Unication Ministry said: “It is possible that there was a problem with his health or safety eventemporary, though it is dficult to assess how the situation might be.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund.

john nelms over vote u turn","story":"Dundee chief John Nelms told fans a ‘yes’ vote was the best possible deal for the club after supporters questioned his U-turn in the SPFL voting saga.Managing director Nelms responded to an email from the Dundee Supporters Association, which comprises  clubs and over , members, after they demanded answers over the Dens Park side’s stance on the controversial SPFL proposal that handed titles to rivals Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers.The Dark Blues have been at the centre of the storm that engulfed Scottish football since last Friday’s requested deadline where their ‘no’ vote failed to arrive with the SPFL and subsequently saw the club holding the decisive call for five days.The club issued a statement at lunchtime yesterday outlining their side in the furore but fell short of declaring their intention to later change to a ‘yes’ vote which sparked outcry from a number of Dark Blues fans when it emerged.The vote saw the SPFL resolution passed but also brought forward league reconstruction talks with Hearts chair Ann Budge joined by Hamilton counterpart Les Gray leading the working group – a stipulation Nelms had made clear would be in exchange for a ‘yes’ to minimise the financial harm dished out to some clubs by the original deal and get the best deal for the Dee.The reaction has been mixed across the Dundee fan group, some positive, many refraining from casting judgement, but amongst that there has been real anger with some fans left dismayed and some even feeling betrayed by the change of decision from Nelms, prompting the request for answers from the DSA.The concern from many is the move did little for the club’s interests while, at the same time, gted the Championship league title to their fiercest rivals.The email sent by the DSA committee yesterday and seen by the Tele said: “We are sure everyone felt a sense of relief yesterday with the casting of the Dundee FC vote in regards to the SPFL resolution of April  but are disappointed that the club has not yet offered a statement to clary the Dundee FC position or explain the change of mind in the voting process from a ‘No’ to a ‘Yes’.“We would urge you therefore to make one as soon as possible to put an end to the conjecture which still continues.“Supporters of Dundee Football Club have been patient over the last few days while trusting that the club would make the correct decision in not just our interests and but the interests of Scottish football as a whole and would welcome a public statement of clarity.“The statement issued by the club yesterday was thought to be vague in some quarters and we feel did not clary or explain our voting position and so we would like to request that the club do this as soon as is practically possible.”Nelms moved quickly to try to assuage fears from the fans responding in a statement: “By way of further explanation of our statement from April , Dundee FC submitted its vote to the SPFL and issued its statement simultaneously.“There was no changing of our vote at any time that day as has been reported in some channels.“If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal on  April .“We have achieved the best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration that was being proposed.“Let us be clear, no matter what the proposal looked like, the majority of the clubs in the Premiership and the Championship are proponents of promotion relegation.“Any solution that did not include this would not have enough support to be passed.  Therefore, the SPFL chose to include it to expedite the conclusion, but without considering the ramications to all clubs.“Most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes did not give us much of a chance.“This is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.“As stated yesterday, reconstruction could help ensure the future of Scottish football as a sustainable and profitable one.“After speaking to numerous clubs we believe that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to establish an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.“We stated that the SPFL will have to accept and support the will of the members.  As you saw in the SPFL statement last night, they already have started this process.“In conclusion, from a very poor situation we have gotten the best result for Dundee FC and for Scottish football as a whole.“Of  teams,  have voted yes in a democratic ballot and for most, the important thing is the monies can be distributed and they can work on survival plans for their clubs.“It is time now toour focus on staying safe and planning for the future of Dundee FC.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their

You look at the English Premier League and English Football League.“Right now there is documentation about them finishing their leagues and there’s tens of millions on the line so they have to play them.“I’m assured that this work starts , but I think it’s really important for the executive of the SPFL, led by Neil Doncaster, to take leadership and he’ll get as much support as he needs from Aberdeen.”In England the Premier League and Football League have been working on plans to complete the campaign to fulfil their lucrative broadcasting demands.Cormack believes Scotland should be trying to do similar, but hopes Uefa’s meeting this week may lead to some clarity.There is a conference call tomorrow with nations and the executive committee of Uefa meet on Thursday.Cormack added: “The meetings with Uefa may lead to some decisions being made.“Meanwhile, in England, we know they are working on what is an aggressive schedule to finish their games because of the broadcasting revenue.“If we had £m on the line to finish the season then I guarantee we’d find a way of playing these games.“How long is a piece of string  We need to know what Uefa says. We said as a club last week it was unlikely and even remote.“But our point is that we didn’t get a chance to discuss this fully as clubs.“The mistake that was made was trying to force thisthrough in two days. It was a complex document and people have dferent interests.“The important needs of the lower league teams are dferent to the needs of the Premiership.”The passing of the resolution gives the SPFL board the power to declare the Premiership campaign over. Cormack has been given assurances that call won’t be made without consultation with the  clubs.He said: “The SPFL board with the vote going through have been given the ability to make that call on their own.“But I don’t believe that decision will be made in isolation to all  clubs without us having a conversation.“It might be so simple and so obvious that Uefa comes out with it and says the leagues are ended and that takes it away from everybody.“The key thing for us is that we’re looking down the barrel of a gun in some shape or formwe’re not playing football in three, four or five months from now.“All our energy should be going into how we move on from here and evaluating things like closed door games.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAt the Argyllshire Advertiser we take pride in impartiality, believing our readers have the gumption to work things out for themselves without us reporting matters in a biased way.In the past five years, the paper has spoken out on just two important issues.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

A community buy-out was, in fact, an option mooted in the bad old days, but negotiations proved dficult at that time.With a new spirit of openness, this has to be an opportunity worth grasping. Inveraray has pretty well lost its connection with Loch Fyne since the pier has been out of bounds. To have full control over the pier is something townsfolk have dreamt of for years.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water. The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water.

The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-economy-braces-biggest-recession-300-years-due-lockdown---likely-recover","story":"While adjusting to le in isolation has been dficult, businesses have been hit particularly hard by the restrictions, with the budget watchdog now warning the country could suffer its biggest recession in  yearslockdown continues into the summer.The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the economy could shrink by  per cent this spring, with unemployment levels reaching . million over the coming months - its highest level since the s.The struggling economy has sparked comparisons to the financial crash in , and the Great Depression of the s, but experts are now predicting the outcome will be much worse.Experts now believe the UK is headed for its biggest economic slump since , when the country was hit by a deep freeze that spread across Europe.Temperatures plummeted on January , bringing with it the worst winter in  years and freezing over several countries, including France, England and Russia.The lsquoGreat Frostrsquo, as it came to be known, lasted for three months and sparked food shortages, thousands of deaths in France, and a huge deficit to the economy.The coronavirus pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record  per cent by June, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas warned.A drop this big would mark the largest decline ldquoin living memory, Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR has said.However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak stressed that this forecast is just one possible scenario, and it merely suggests the scale of what the country is currently facing will have ldquoserious implications for our economy.He said: ldquoWe came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses.ldquoOur planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.ldquoOur plan is the right plan.Mr Sunak assured that the government would not stand by and will act to support the economy, adding that the OBR expects the economic impact of the pandemic to be temporary.Despite being forecast for a signicant decline, the UK is expected toto its pre-coronavirus economic growth by the end of this year, with the OBR stating this amount will depend on how long the lockdown lasts.The OBR predicts that any drop in growth will be reversed in the three months to September, as the economy starts to recover.However, it warned that the pandemic may have a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise to . million by the end of June.Unemployment levels are currently . million, marking a rise from . per cent to  per cent.Unemployment rates are expected to remain high until , before dropping back to four per cent, according to the OBRrsquos forecast."},{"url":null,"title":"11-year-olds-thank-letter-delights-ambulance-staff","story":"Sarah Brady, , a primary seven pupil at Wallyford Primary School, was taking part in the first lsquoClap for our Carersrsquo event on March  with mum Samantha.She noticed the ambulance sitting at the end of her street so quickly drafted a letter and ran over with a rose and gave it to them.The letter read: ldquoThanks for everything yoursquore doing for the world, love Sarah Brady.Samantha said: ldquoThe clap was amazing.ldquoA few days later the ambulance had to come back to my house for my partner.ldquoThe ambulance lady said that two men were in Wallyford recently and someone gave them a letter and that they were really overwhelmed.

But the behaviour results in too many people arriving in locations that have less resources to deal with an increase in patients, who need specialist and often intensive care facilities.Scottish communities angrily reacted to the influx in visitors - some resorting to barricading lay-bys and would-be camping areas - warning that their already-under pressure local health services cannot cope with the extra strain.Last month, a military aircraft was needed to transport a critically-ill coronavirus patient from the Shetland Islands to Aberdeen to receive intensive care treatment.This led to the Scottish Government announcing that ferries services were now to only be used for islanders, allowing them to continue essential journeys.Even before the official lockdown was put in place, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told accommodation providers to stop accepting bookings - a message reiterated ahead of what would have been the Easter holidays.A Scottish Government spokesperson, said: ldquoWe need everyone to stay at home to help us save lives and protect our NHS.\"We also need businesses to help us achieve this.

Writer at Large Neil Mackay reportsITrsquoS just over a year since the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand, when  people were shot dead at a mosque and Islamic centre ndash the killings live-streamed online.What marked the atrocity out as dferent from other white supremacist attacks, was that a manesto believed to have been connected to the gunman spoke of the acts being inspired by \"eco-fascism\". The manesto talks of environmentalism and population growth. It states that: ldquoContinued immigration into Europe is environmental warfare.Christchurch, however, wouldnrsquot be the last time that far-right violence intersected with the environment. Four-and-a-half months after Christchurch, on August , , a gunman shot and killed  people in El Paso, Texas. The killings were the deadliest attack on Americarsquos Latino community in history. A manesto, which police believe is connected to the alleged gunman, said the El Paso killings were inspired by what happened in Christchurch and motivated by ldquothe Hispanic invasion of Texas.The El Paso manesto is called \"An Inconvenient Truth\" ndash mirroring the title of Al Gorersquos  documentary on the threat of climate change. In the manesto, the writer says the people of America are ldquotoo stubborn to change their lestyles ldquoso the next logical step is to decrease the number of people in America using its resources. If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of le can become more sustainable.The writer also talks of oil, agriculture, and recycling the destruction of the environment and the impact of environmental degradation on future generations. ldquoOur lestyle is destroying the environment of our country, the manesto reads. ldquoThe decimation of the environment is creating a massive burden for future generations. Corporations are heading the destruction of our environment by shamelessly over-harvesting resources.One man has pleaded guilty to the Christchurch killings, and one man is awaiting trial for the attack in El Paso.Are these shootings the canary in the coal-mine, however  Are they warning us that the most extreme elements of the far-right are starting to co-opt environmentalism  Once the coronavirus pandemic is over, who knows how politics will realign and ideology sht and change.With climate change denial now recognised widely as an untenable scientic position, some extremists have latched on to environmental concerns, added them to racism and anti-immigration beliefs, and created a curdled form of eco-fascism.Professor Gary LaFree, from the University of Maryland and a former director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, has studied the role of environmentalism for a new breed of far-right extremists.ldquoTheyrsquore building an ideology, he says, adding: ldquoYou notice theyrsquore referring to each other hellip which to me makes it scarier. Itrsquos more like a social movement.Academic, activist and author Naomi Kleinrsquos new book, On Fire: TheCase For A Green New Deal, warns of the growth of eco-fascism. Klein has been called ldquothe intellectual godmother of the Green New Deal Movement. The Green New Deal envisages a greening of the economy, and reforms creating a fairer job market.Klein says: ldquoMy fear is that, unless something signicant changes in how our societies rise to the ecological crisis, we are going to see this kind of white power eco-fascism emerge with much greater frequency, as a ferocious rationalisation for refusing to live up to our collective climate responsibilities.At the heart of the problem is this: whattodayrsquos idealistic climate campaigners fail to change things  Whatactivists like Greta Thunberg donrsquot succeed in making governments act for the good of the world  Could environmentalism then be hijacked by the far right As the climate deteriorates, and governments fail to act, the far-right is already starting to seek to exploit public fears and discontent. There has long been academic theorising that in order to fix an almost insurmountable problem like climate change, society might find itself turning to some form of authoritarian \"strongman\" party or government, as liberal democracy may be too weak to take the measures required.Professor Michael E Zimmerman, a philosopher and environmental historian, describes eco-fascism as \"a totalitarian government that requires iniduals to sacrice their interests to the well-being of the lsquolandrsquo .It is easy to see how the far-right could manipulate environmental issues and pit them against immigration. So far, the far-right has been pretty much in the climate denial camp ndash but it looks asthatrsquos starting to change. In France, Marine Le Pen, leader of National Rallyndash until recently the National Front ndash has started to go green. France and Europe, says Le Pen, should be the worldrsquos ldquofirst ecological civilisation.One prominent member of RN, Jordan Bardella, said that ldquoborders are the environmentrsquos greatest ally itrsquos through them that we will save the planet.Le Pen has said the inidual is ldquonot simply a consumer or producer but ldquosomeone rooted, someone who wants to live on their land and pass it on to their children. She says someone ldquowho is rooted in their home is an ecologist and that those who are ldquonomadic hellip donrsquot care about the environment they have no homeland.The French thinker Jean-Yves Camus, who specialises in the extreme right, says environmentalism has ldquobecome part of the RNrsquos political agenda, but itrsquos a specically far-right form of environmentalism ndash very identitarian.Camus believes many far-right voters ldquosee society as like a biological organism that should be kept in its original state. According to this line of thinking, when a foreign body is introduced, it causes disorder ndash hence the anti-immigration stance. Logically, the same goes for nature: we must respect the natural order.The hardline Alternative for Germany Party has also seen an environmental sht. The youth wing of Germanyrsquos anti-immigrant party has been urging its leaders to drop climate denial.Naomi Klein says: ldquoThere is rage out there that is going to go somewhere, and we have demagogues who are expert at directing rage at the most vulnerable among us while protecting the most powerful and most culpable.Perhaps one of the biggest potential recruiting sergeants for the far-right when it comes to the environment would be any greening of industry which hurts rather than helps ordinary workers. Extremists could step in and say that they are the ones who can offer ecology and protect the poor.Already, therersquos widespread suspicion across the west that some environmental policies have done more for big business and the middle classes than either the planet or the poorest. The Yellow Vest protests in France were triggered after a backlash against green taxes which were seen to hurt the worse off in society.Josep Borrell, the EUrsquos new foreign policy chief, was recently attacked for comments he made about young climate activists. He said: ldquoI would like to knowyoung people demonstrating in Berlin hellip are willing to lower their living standards to offer compensation to Polish miners, becausewe fight against climate change for real they will lose their jobs and will have to be subsidised.Borrell may have offended supporters of Greta Thunberg, but there is a genuine risk thatany Green New Deal is executed in a way which isnrsquot socially fair, this would be a fatal error easy to exploit by a far-right movement thatrsquos starting to embrace environmentalism.The concerns about Polish miners are on point. Poland is heavily dependent on coal, and Warsaw has refused to sign up to the EUrsquos  climate targets, which would lead to coal mining being phased out.There are complaints in Romania that plans to reskill miners have benefited decarbonisation firms rather than workers. Firms are making money from the \"reskilling\" market, but jobs and investment in new sectors havenrsquot appeared.Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, one of the worldrsquos largest asset management companies, has said that because of decarbonisation ldquowe are on the edge of fundamentally reshaping finance. Could the creation of a post-pandemic green economy benefit the rich, not the poor ldquoThe danger is that the public money hellip put into greening the European economy will instead merely subsidise greenwashing, says Daniela Gabor, professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol.In other words, taxes pay for big business to show off green credentials. Meanwhile, jobs are lost, no new jobs are created, and the planet isnrsquot helped.Itrsquos a recipe for public cynicism, and risks a popular rejection of mainstream political attempts to fix the climate crisis.Labourrsquos Keir Starmer has warned that any Green New Deal must ldquomean good jobs in new green industries. Starmer says we need to recognise that ldquothe poorest bear the least responsibility and the heaviest burden of climate breakdown.The development of eco-fascism also coincides with the growing crisis for democracy in the western world. Dissatisfaction with democracy is at a record high, particularly in Britain and America. One study by the University of Cambridge found that % of those questioned were dissatisfied with democracy.ldquoAcross the globe, democracy is in a state of malaise, said the reportrsquos author, Roberto Foa. Ominously, the economic crash and the refugee crisis are both seen as contributing to dissatisfaction with democracy. Now coronavirus has arrived as a new peril.The study suggests that the rise of populism is not a cause of dissatisfaction but a symptom.In the UK, for example, satisfaction with democracy rose steadily from the s for some  years ndash peaking just after the millennium.At the same time as the appeal of democracy waned, fears over the climate rose sharply. Developed and industrialised nations are feeling the effects of climate change now, with floods and fires, droughts and other wild weather.The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, says the world is ldquoway off track when it comes to dealing with the climate emergency, and time is running out.The UNrsquos assessment of global climate found that  was a record-breaking year for heat. More people are also on the move due to extreme temperatures and flooding. Once again, the connection between the environment and migration is there waiting for the far-right to step in and exploit it.In , the worldrsquos oceans were the warmest on record, with at least % of seas experiencing a heatwave. Surface air temperatures were the hottest ever recorded. For the nd year in a row, more ice was lost from glaciers than gained ndash this caused sea levels to go up to their highest since records began.Before the postponement of the UN climate summit in Glasgow due to coronavirus, Guterres was setting some hope on Scotland. ldquoWe need more ambition on [emission cuts], adaption and finance in time for the climate conference, COP, in Glasgow, UK, in November, he said, prior to the lockdown. ldquoThat is the only way to ensure a safer, more prosperous and sustainable future for all people on a healthy planet.COP stands for the th Conference of the Parties ndash the UNrsquos Climate Change Conference. When the conference was held in France in  it adopted the Paris Agreement and signalled a step-change in how the world looked at the climate crisis, with nearly  nations agreeing ambitious goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit temperature rises.The Glasgow climate conference is now delayed until , but calls remain for it to kickstart a new green tech revolution. Researchers at Oxford University, led by Mike Mason of the School of Enterprise and the Environment, believe harnessing new technology could reduce carbon emissions by at least one billion tonnes a year.Examples of new green technology include converting cheap renewable energy ndash from wind, sun or wave ndash into zero-carbon fuel.But any Green New Deal needs to work for people as well as the planet. Unless ordinary workers are brought along, with new jobs and decent wages, then the fracture point between the economy and ecology will be a gt to extremists.Too often green measures are seen as hurting the poorest. A ban in England on the sale of wet wood and coal for domestic fireplaces, for example, was criticised for pushing people in rural areas into poverty.For Naomi Klein the rise of eco-fascism means that while therersquos a growing tendency among far-right extremists to no longer deny climate change, what they will continue to deny is any common humanity between people across the world.A far-right vision of environmentalism will be Darwinian, a brutal case of \"us versus them\", of pulling up the drawbridge. If we donrsquot act quickly and intelligently, then race and immigration could soon come to contaminate the debate about the environment.ldquoLet there be no mistake, says Klein. ldquoThis is the dawn of climate barbarism. And unless there is a radical change not only in politics but in the underlying values that govern our politics, this is how the wealthy world is going to lsquoadaptrsquo to more climate disruption: by fully unleashing the toxic ideologies that rank the relative value of human lives in order to justy the monstrous discarding of huge swathes of humanity.Klein wants to douse the flames of eco-fascism. The way to do that is to create well-paid, secure jobs for anyone whose livelihood is put at risk by the turn away from fossil fuels ndash and for the state to take on the burden of retraining workers of all ages. Thatrsquos the real Green New Deal. Thatrsquos the way to kill off eco-fascism while itrsquos still in its cradle.THE DEEP ROOTS OF ECO-FASCISMThe far-rightrsquos move to embrace the environment as part of its ideological agenda is nothing new. Itrsquos just been dormant for a long time.As with much of modern fascism, its roots lie in Nazi Germany. Nazi ideology hinged around the concept of \"Blood and Soil\" ndash the idea that Aryans had a mystical connection to their nation and a duty to protect the land.There was an almost romantic obsession with rural le in Nazi Germany, and it was seen as superior to urban living. Many Hitler Youth were sent to work on farms as ldquoonly those of German blood may be farmers.The Blood and Soil ideology found its most perverse outlet in the shape of both Nazi eugenics and lebensraum, the idea that German people should expand into lands once owned by their German ancestors. Nazi art and film also gloried nature.The first eco-terrorist was neither right nor left. Ted Kaczynski, otherwise known as the Unabomber, was a former mathematics professor who left society and his career to live off grid in the wilds of Montana.He saw himself as a revolutionary destined to overthrow ldquothe system and despised technology. Between  and , he killed three people and injured  others in a series of bomb attacks across the USA against universities, airlines and other industrial targets. Kaczynski even tried to bring down a passenger jet.Like todayrsquos eco-fascists, Kaczynski wrote his own manesto entitled Industrial Society and its Future, in which he justied his bombings by saying that modern le was destroying humanity. The manesto begins: ldquoThe Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.Kaczynski was arrested in  by the FBI and is now serving le without the possibility of parole in a federal supermax prison."},{"url":null,"title":"unremembered-scotland-new-book-reveals-fascinating-snippets-nations-history","story":"Getting there had involved overcoming the forces of nature, biding time for tides and the weather to align in an act of grace that would allow a small craft to be hauled on to the narrow, shingle beach.Patience was rewarded. As Patrick Baker paddled his kayak past wobbling purple and white jellyfish and the occasional porpoise, battling to beat the temperamental currents, the deserted island of Belnahua took shape.Once ashore, he trekked over the beach and the overgrown grass to reach deserted terraced homes where dozens of slate quarry workers and their families once lived. Long since abandoned, the dilapidated walls and rusting machinery remain rooted, crumbling monuments to an almost forgotten age when Scottish island mined slate put a roof over the world.ldquoBelnahua was very ghostly, says Baker, an Edinburgh-based outdoor writer whose new book The Unremembered Placesexplores some of Scotlandrsquos wild, often overlooked locations and unravels the fascinating stories embedded in their past.ldquoIt was eerie and poignant and beautul, he continues. ldquoThe journey to Belnahua adds to its mystique. The island has that rare frozen-in-time quality to it.ldquoLots of the places I ended up visiting had that same feeling.Part travelogue and part social history, Baker has recorded his journeys to locations that have fallen off the beaten track: hidden caves, a quiet Highland reservoir with a deadly human toll linked to its construction, and secluded islands.Despite doing the footwork to become familiar with each before setting off, often these \"unremembered\" places still managed to capture Baker off-guard either by their enigmatic beauty or a tiny detail that shed new light on their seldom-told histories.At Belnahua, once at the epicentre of a mammoth slate industry which saw it and its neighbouring islands send Dalradian slate around the world, Baker picked his way through the \"ghost village\" with its abandoned homes, corroded machinery, rusted steam-driven crane and flooded quarries.Beyond the physical remains, he unravelled a much deeper story of island communities surrounded by turbulent waters which carried an astonishing number of vessels ndash a fair number of which would end up wrecked as they battled against the harsh, stormy Atlantic waters.ldquoThat brutality of the winter storms and their location on the edge of the Atlantic, would have made it an incredible place to live, says Baker. ldquoAt one point the water around Belnahua was one of the busiest watercourses around the UK, which is incredible to think of.A series of economic and natural calamities including a storm which Baker describes as being ldquoof epic proportions devastated the industry, leaving ft deep mines flooded by the swell of seawater which drenched their workings, and families with no work or reason to stay.Once home to more than  people at the slate industryrsquos peak at the end of the th century, by the s the island was empty.ldquoIt feels like it has been deserted, reflects Baker, whose book links the growth of the slate industry with bustling sea traffic and the rise of lighthouses to guide vessels on their way.ldquoIt was a rapid turnaround of being a very populated island with many people living on a tiny patch of land, to being completely deserted within a matter of weeks.ldquoIt has a feeling of rapid desertion to it. Itrsquos quite eerie but fascinating with machinery lying where it was left and no-one going to remove it.ldquoThe houses are there, he adds. ldquoBut what struck me was the row of deserted cottages which housed the slate miners and their families.ldquoIt banks to a small beach that is just footsteps from the front door to the water. I stood there and thought what an incredible place to live, but equally what a very hard and brutal place.ldquoItrsquos only really when you visit these places that you can transpose yourself into what it must have been like to live there and experience that.ldquoAnd Belnhua is very visceral and very real.While some \"unremembered\" spots are remote and challenging to reach, such as Blackwater Reservoir in Lochaber where he was taken aback by the small graveyard and the human cost of creating the dam, others are far closer to urban le.The Glen Loin Caves near Arrochar in West Dunbartonshire are the reputed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his army after the Battle of Methven in . However, Baker points out that much more recently they were a focal point for working-class sporting prowess.For two decades from the s, groups from the hard-working shipyards and poverty-stricken Glasgow tenements made the area their playground, taking up weekend residence in the caves from where they would climb the rocky walls of the \"Arrochar Alps\".The climbing clubs they formed would go on to lay the foundations for the sportrsquos modern standards, techniques and ethics.However, as years passed, the location of the caves they frequented became largely forgotten Bakerrsquos search for them resulting in a frustrating challenge over jagged rocks, through pines and across overgrown gashes in the hillside before finally stumbling into the dark, gaping entrance.ldquoSome of the places are pretty remote and hard to get to which may be a discouragement to people seeking to visit them, says Baker, as he explains the balance to be struck between drawing attention to secluded, forgotten spots and attracting people to visit.ldquoWe want to share the wonderment we are seeing and share these stories, he adds, ldquobut we donrsquot want to degrade the places or their mystery.Thatrsquos a particular issue for the \"wild\" islands he visits, dotted across Loch Awe and Loch Shiel, havens for wildle, some harbouring centuries-old graveyards or, in the case of Eilean Fhianain, once home to Irish missionary Saint Finnan and with its ruined chapel and burial grounds.Other islands revealed another side to their previously well-documented character.Baker explored Inchkeith Island, three miles north of Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth, aware of its prominence as a stop-off point for vessels between Fe and Edinburgh since the th century but surprised to discover its links to a bizarre attempt to invade the Port of Leith.ldquoI often had an idea about the story that was going to unravel in a particular place, and then found out other elements, says Baker, whose book covers eight destinations, each with its own character and signicance.ldquoIt was fascinating to find out about Inchkeithrsquos strategic importance and how, in , it was used as a sort of staging post for a fleet under the command of Scots-born John Paul Jones, who effectively founded the US Navy.A squadron of five ships had gathered at the mouth of the estuary near Dunbar, sparking panic in towns along the coast.Sailing under a commission for the Continental Navy for the American Colonies, John Paul Jones was known for attacking British naval and merchant ships and launching land offensives.His sights on this occasion, writes Baker, were set on Leith.Having penned a letter threatening to attack the port, his vessels took anchor at Inchkeith Island to await their next move.As luck had it, a fierce westerly gale put paid to Jonesrsquos plans. Having been prevented from reaching the port, Jones decided it was ldquoimpossible to pursue the enterprise with a good prospect of success.Baker, who has previously written about stories and landscape of the Cairngorms, says while the \"unremembered\" locations explored in his book may seem disparate, they share common links.ldquoScotlandrsquos wild histories ... speak of immeasurable social change, of the movement of people through time and landscape, he writes. ldquoYet they are often lost, overlooked or passed by.ldquoThey still have cultural relevance, but we donrsquot tend to give them enough signicance. Thatrsquos the common theme.The Unremembered Places by Patrick Baker is published by Birlinn on May "},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  39 s Country Life  an army at work on the home front","story":"It wasnrsquot until we moved to the country that I needed a diary the way fish need water. We got the keys to the cottage on a brilliantly frosty Friday and moved our belongings in over the weekend. Until then, wersquod forgotten that we had nothing to sleep on. Two nights in a nearby hotel was our last experience of domestic warmth for many months to come. A mattress was delivered on the Monday, which was also the day the first tradespeople arrived, to measure for shutters. With Christmas looming, we needed to put things in place as fast as possible, ahead of the long festive shutdown or, as that chapter in our memoirs will read, The Big Freeze.It would be quicker to tell you who hasnrsquot been over the door these past two years. Thanks to ill-fitting windows, draughty doors, a leaking roof, and a central heating system suffering from poor circulation, for the first three months I worked in the kitchen, as close to the boiler as I could get. Some books are kept under wraps until the day of publication, but the one I was battling with was typed from beneath layers of thermals, wool and eiderdown, with a hot water bottle on my lap where once there had been a cat.The extent of our igloo-like crisis was brought home the day we stood in front of the French windows, discussing triple glazing with the man from Everest. His breath and ours met as we spoke, sending up a mushroom cloud above the packing boxes. Snow fell steadily outside, blown sideways by a gale, like a film directorrsquos idea of a backwoods scene. Somehow it also managed to get inside, through the jambs. At this point the comparison with an igloo, which is better built and insulated, collapses.In the months since, we feel aswersquove got to know half of the Bordersrsquo tradesmen. Each week the diary has been stuffed with appointments, as we set about tackling all our problems, some immediately evident, others only making themselves known after stormy weather or excavation.The local economy must surely have taken an upturn since we arrived. Diary entries from the week we arrived to the Friday before lockdown began show that we have had window fitters, joiners , plumbers, heating engineers, roofers, painters, locksmiths, glaziers, IT experts, telephone engineer, loft insulators, pest controller, kitchen fitters, electricians, wood-burning stove suppliers, carpet cleaners, carpet layers, stone masons, carpenters, plasterers, chimney sweep, fencers, drystone dykers, and a landscape gardener, all contributing to the home front.We even had a man with a scythe to tackle the so-called lawn which, after a fortnightrsquos absence in the first springtime, had turned into a waist-high meadow. After that he came every two weeks with his Rolls-Royce of a lawnmower and extendable shears, to keep the ancient beech hedge under control. Hisevery spring after the long winter is a bright spot on the calendar.Men ndash and apart from one Polish window fitter and a locksmith who replaced several door latches they have all been men ndash have inspected the chimneys by binoculars and ladder, crept into the crawl space under the roof with torch in mouth, and delved beneath floors in an attempt to trace the labyrinth of pipes. Irsquove seen the original th-century lath and plasterwork exposed in the kitchen, and been shown a field drain predating the cottage at the front. The old cart house at the back, which later became a cobblerrsquos, was reached by a flagged path, and remnants of this, which had served for  years and more, were exposed when our tumbledown old wall was rebuilt. That would explain why, previously, whenever Alan attempted to drive a spade into this part of the garden he would shudder ashersquod had an electric shock.Clearing the front flowerbed a couple of weeks ago, I pulled out a long-buried rubber pipe, perished with age, which disappeared, goodness knows where, under the Buddleia. While I was tugging, Alan came upon a smooth oval stone, so hefty he could barely budge it. It was either the mould for a giant Easter egg, or the first rugby ball in the Borders.If there is one common factor with the army that has worked on the house, it is rugby. An astonishing number of tradesmen are either players or former players. All but a very few are avid followers. One chap was undergoing treatment for his latest injuries when he first turned up, having on earlier occasions broken his back and a leg at play. He was clearly in a lot of pain but, several months and many injections later, he was finally fit to rejoin his team.Give how physical their work is, you can see why so many of them are sportsmen. There was one young man who, unbeknownst to us, was clambering around our rooftop without any sign of a harness, nearly giving our neighbour across the green palpitations. For the space of five days while he worked, the front door stood wide open ndash it was January ndash but when I askedthe cold bothered him, he said he liked it. He never put the heating on in his flat.Two months later, in the wake of the Beast from the East, the kitchen was installed and the door stood ajar for a further five days. This time I had to work upstairs, typing in rhythm to the bass beat on the joinerrsquos radio, and thereby generating a frisson of heat. He too seemed not to notice the Arctic blast. All of them seem exceptionally tough and strong. Which is just as well, because therersquos a lot more work still to do."},{"url":null,"title":"rab-mcneil-retail-rules-exercise-obsession-load-bs","story":"I DONrsquoT want to be one of those people who complain about the behaviour of others during the coronavirus. Everyone has a story to tell, and my brief one simply involves a visit to the supermarket.This is a nerve-wracking experience now, less frequent than it used to be and hedged in with so many rules that you fear breaking merely through forgetfulness or habit. So you approach the entrance, saying to yourself: ldquoRemember to do this and not to do that. Donrsquot get into a fight. Donrsquot pick your nose.And then you get in and find a young woman blocking the narrow entrance aisle so nobody can get past, while she texts something. At last, after causing a back-up at the door, she finally finishes and, ignoring the wipes and free gloves, goes over to the fruit and veg, where she starts picking up ious peppers with her hands, testing them before putting them back. Unbelievable.I mention it partly to tell you a story about something even more unbelievable that I saw in a supermarket back in BV . This middle-aged woman was doing the same as the young pepper-woman, only with bakery rolls. She picked up several and felt them for consistency. Then, when she had made her selection, she used the provided tongs to put them in her bag.Somewhere in her brain she must have acknowledged that you were supposed to use the tongs, but she hadnrsquot computed that these were provided to stop you handling the products.

Oh joy. If only it could be extended to include family friends and friends. Imagine a ban on cheek-kissing.

But, on the escalators, thatrsquos to allow busy, important people to overtake.You know that people will just do the same on the pavements as they already do on the roads when you leave a decent distance between you and the car in front, and the impatient maddies overtake into it and fill up the space.So much for humans. Animals will also be affected by the new rules. Cats will be kept indoors, meaning the gardens of neighbours wonrsquot be so full of excreta and mangled songbirds.Back to humans, and another revolutionary suggestion is that muzak could be turned off in shops so that people didnrsquot have to move closer to each other to hear what theyrsquore saying.Yoursquove got to admit this is all rather grand.

I nearly did that myself when, bereft of my weekly gym visit, I rescued a whole load of equipment from the garden shed and the attic, and nearly broke my back trying to assemble it.I must say though that, once it was up and running, and I had a wee go on it, I felt marvellous afterwards. Endorphins and whatnot whizzed round my heid and I said to myself: ldquoI must do this more often.Never done it again since. The stuff just sits there in the spare bedroom, or man-cave, along with all the guitars I canrsquot play and woodworking and DIY tools that I canrsquot work.Instead, I have concentrated on exercising my mind, catching up with a load of reading of actual books.

Remove the dish from the oven and allow to cool. Meanwhile heat one punnet of raspberries with the icing sugar in a pan until the raspberries start to pop and the sugar has dissolved.

All the countries of the world are in a state of financial crisis. We must get back to where we were before we consider further radical change. If we ever do, that is...The other strand of thought goes: The place we were before, with the UK Government sacricing health and social careon the altar of profit, prioritising jingoistic wars over the war on poverty and ignoring the suggestions of the Scottish Government to take a dferent route was how we got in this mess. We must take this chance to overhaul the system and find a new way.As the UK Government keeps telling us, our last upheaval of such magnitude was the Second World War. People cheered Churchill for winning the war, but this did not blind them to the need for fundamental change. At the first opportunity they voted the Tories out and brought in a Labour Government. The remnants of the innovations brought in by Attlees Government, though watered down by subsequent Tory and Labour Governments, are what we rely on to save us today.At the end of this crisis we must take the chance for fundamental change, for the chance will not come again.Mary McCabe, Glasgow G.TOM Gordon is right to consider how Covid- has damaged the cause of independence . But Covid is not the only problem for the true believers in the one true church of Scottish nationalism.The first real crack in the campaign for independence was losing the  referendum. The next, in the eyes of most Scots, was refusing to accept the democratic result of that referendum. The next wound, this time self-inflicted, was the report of the SNPs own Sustainable Growth Commission. The Commission was set up by the SNP to provide an economic case for the break-up of the UK but merely succeeded in revealing that the case was as weak as its opponents had said, and would it require at least a decade of deep austerity just toto current level of prosperity, after which time we might, just maybe, meet the criteria for EU membership. Then came Brexit. The pain and distress caused by attempting to disentangle our -year partial union with Europe only served to highlight the futility of trying to break up our three hundred year-old all-encompassing union with England.As for Covid: the First Minister is fond of claiming this or that event as a ldquomaterial change, justying the need for a second independence referendum. The irony is that the Covid pandemic is a real material change, but not in favour of her campaign. Covid shows the value of the Union and the advantages of having a large and strong economy, a huge network of academic, industrial and medical expertise on hand to address the existential problems and strong enough to absorb economic and societal shocks far out of the ordinary. And please dont mention the oil price.Mr Gordon is right: Covid- is a serious challenge to the true believers in independence. But in reality, the case for independence was always weak.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, Largs.TOM Gordons contention that the UK has been better together ignores the appalling lack of preparation shown by the Westminster Government in dealing with the virus together with a lack of transparency and ineffectual leadership. The First Minster has been resolute and empathetic consistently and inspires a confidence that Boris Johnson and his assorted chums can only dream of.Mr Gordons supine argument against independence appears to boil down to the attempted economic rescue plan from the Treasury that will, hopefully, mitigate against the worst excesses of the effects of the virus on our economic lives. An independent Scotland, hopefully as members of the EU, would not only be in a position to reinvigorate our economic le but would also benefit from support from other EU nations which, post Brexit, will undoubtedly hamper economic resurgence in the UK, regardless of Mr Gordons threadbare hopes.It is interesting to note that the Irish republics reaction to the pandemic was not only quicker in cancelling sports events, closing businesses and in adopting a pragmatic, dogma-free style of leadership than the UK. It was also more effective in controlling the virus and initiating large-scale testing amongst the population and,when adjusted for population figures, Britain has suffered more than twice the amount of deaths than Ireland has at present. An independent Scotland, as Nicola Sturgeon continues to demonstrate, would be just as prepared and efficient as any other country in the world, the more sowe were unfettered from the clumsy and inept shackles of Westminster.Owen Kelly, Stirling.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

Itrsquos also the job of journalists to point out how badly other people are running the country. Irsquom yet to be convinced they should be running it themselves.:Cabinet ministers rally behind Johnson after suggestion he was missing in action at start of virus outbreakBut this is what crises like coronavirus do: they reveal, and expose, what people are like, but they also transform, and change, people too, and Irsquod be surprisedthe Prime Ministerrsquos time in hospital hasnrsquot changed him in some way. Speak to doctors and nurses and theyrsquoll tell you that intensive care has a profound effect on anyone whorsquos ever been a patient there. You tend to reassess your le when death brushes up against you.The changes,any, that have happened to Mr Johnson may become clear in time, but we can hope for one at least. Some of the nurses who treated him in hospital were migrants whorsquod come to the UK to work in the NHS and yoursquod like to think that fact would make the PM reconsider the benefits of immigration and go for a dferent kind of Brexit. In that sense, perhaps the coronavirus will have shted him a little to the left.You wonder toothe effect is more widespread: we now have a Tory government, so recently wreathed in austerity grey, that has overseen an unprecedented expansion in state benefits and support, paid for by a massive increase in public debt ndash no wonder the new Labour leader Keir Starmer is struggling to find something to disagree with. The crisis has also made some people reconsider their political assumptions, which is only right and proper: many facts have changed, so many opinions must change too.My hope is that the effect will work on everyone to some extent: left, right, Remain, Leaver, unionist, nationalist. For example, Irsquod like to think that some of the Scots whorsquove been inclined towards independence will ask themselves whether coronavirus doesnrsquot demonstrate the social and economic benefits of nations working together in unions.Equally, other people may be thinking again about what the state should be doing for its citizens and I hope that would include the PM, although it wonrsquot be easy for him ndash as a journalist and politician, hersquos railed against the nanny state now, suddenly, he finds himself wearing nannyrsquos apron.That second category ndash people whorsquove looked again at their views on state support ndash is particularly interesting and I would certainly include myself in that group. Irsquove seen lots of friends lose their businesses and incomes in the last few weeks and Irsquove seen them try to access state benefits or the other government schemes. Itrsquos been upsetting and unsettling and in the end it may not even work ndash therersquos no guarantee theyrsquoll get what they need to see them through.In some ways, whatrsquos happened has exposed the problems with any kind of means-tested system: it takes time to process, it costs a lot of money, and it can lead to unfair cut-offs between people in similar circumstances. But there are problems with universal benefits too: theyrsquore also expensive and you spend some of the money on people who donrsquot need it. Both systems have their drawbacks.However, the Covid crisis has particularly underlined the problems with our current set-up. The sudden influx of people needing help means a lot of bureaucracy and expense itrsquos also inefficient, potentially unfair, and inclined towards abuse. We know, for example, that a lot of people who are entitled to help have not appliedconversely, some companies have furloughed staff while getting them to do work on the side.All of this bureaucracy and abuse could potentially have been avoided ndash and I find it hard to believe Irsquove come round to an idea I wouldrsquove once considered loony left-wing ndash by a system that works to a basic, bottom-line income thatrsquos paid no matter your circumstances. It would mean everyone would be guaranteed a basic level of support without having to go through a long process to access it and we would not be facing such a sudden and catastrophic surge in spending. There are also good, Conservative reasons for supporting a universal income provided it came with a reduction in other benefits: it would make the pubic sector smaller, andit improves peoplersquos health, it might reduce the cost of the NHS.The NHS, as it happens, as well as social care, is another area where reassessment is going on. To some extent, therersquos been a little bit of cant in the criticism of the government handling of coronavirus ndash an unprecedented crisis situation is never going to go entirely smoothly and it should be judged by the circumstance of the crisis rather than before it. But for a long time the UK and Scottish governments have talked about spending increases on the NHS and social care without addressing the question of whether we are spending enough. At the end of all this, we urgently need a realistic assessment of what the system actually needs.We should question other shibboleths too. Even where I am in the middle of nowhere in Ayrshire Irsquove been appreciating the lack of cars on the road and planes in the sky it was so quiet the other day I heard a sheep fart. So perhaps, for a start, we could address the ludicrous cheapness of air travel by taxing it more heavily ndash certainly, the SNPrsquos been moving on the issue and has repudiated its old policy of big cuts for airlines. A lot of people might also be much more sympathetic now than they were towards financial disincentives on owning cars.:Mark Smith: The problem with the Scottish Governmentrsquos laws on Covid  They donrsquot go far enoughIrsquom not saying any of these ideas are madly radical and Irsquom not saying my sympathy for them qualies me as a leftie. But this crisis has changed the lives of every person in the country, and principles and assumptions that we took for granted have been undermined or swept away altogether.

Points will be awarded for such things as being able to speak English, having a job already lined up and meeting appropriate skill levels. They will also have to meet a minimum salary threshold, which the guidance informs is generally £,, although a lower salary might be accepted in some circumstances.Under this new system, low-skilled workers will not be able to receive visas to live and work in the UK.The new system however, will not apply to EU citizens already living in the UK by December , this year. They will be eligible to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.Highlighting the impact immigrants have had in the fight against coronavirus, Mr Carmichael called on the government to rethink its plans and support key workers.“When the immigration proposals were first announced earlier in the year I called them short-sighted and a risk to the long-term future of island communities,” he said.“We are already seeing the potential harm we risk to our communities and our country. It is time that the government started rethinking its plans.“Around the UK we are seeing the positive impact that immigrants are having as key workers in the fight against coronavirus. That the government has not reflected on this at all in developing its advice on immigration policy is disappointing. If immigrants can be essential workers in our country’s time of crisis, then they deserve our support to remain here afterwards.”Mr Carmichael added: “Last week I joined my colleague Christine Jardine in calling for foreign nationals working in the NHS in this crisis to have the right to remain.

The quiz, devised by Steph and the fundraising team at CLAN, includes questions on local knowledge as well as current events, entertainment and travel.Steph said: “We have had a fantastic response from people, not only from the north-east but across the UK to the CLAN Sunday Sofa Quiz.#We were looking for a way to continue to engage with our supporters, keep people entertained at home, and to help raise vital funds for people affected by cancer.#Over  teams took part this weekend, with the number taking part growing every week. It’s a fun thing for all the family to take part in and raises money for CLAN at a very dficult time for the charity.“Being in lockdown is challenging for everyone, but even more so for those faced with a cancer diagnosis. That’s online fundraising is help us continue our telephone, email and online resource centre, as well as CLAN Haven, our bed and breakfast facility for those attending cancer treatment at ARI.”The Sunday Sofa Quiz can be accessed through CLAN’s Facebook page, and also through its website at clanhouse.org.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue. Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK. Let#s allow them, women and man alike, to be fully welcomed as valued members of our communities, with equal status.Let#s make the changes needed to fully include them and their families and so appreciate the strength in ersity that is their much appreciated contribution to modern Shetland, modern Scotland and modern Britain.Peter#s choice of poetry is particularly relevant during a week when British farmers chartered planes to collect  farm workers from Romania.The manager of the airline says he has already put in a bid for the next six flights.These Romanians form the first link in a long chain that magically re-stocks our supermarket shelves while we lie sleeping in our beds every night.For those with an apatite for further contemplation, I would recommend the following article:Thanks for the helpful and interesting link Malcolm. It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward. He had to pay my dental bill and a £ fine.

That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in . I hope that recording will make its way into Tobar an Dualchais one day.I met Willie Matheson just the once long ago – Allan insisted I come with him to the hospital where Willie was in a wheelchair, frail but with bright eyes and a welcome smile. I was just at the very beginning of coming to an understanding of Gaelic culture, but there, with my hazy stumbling knowledge, I felt included.Such brief encounters can mean so much. – The Sufferings of Christ.

The project came about when Village Blinds was forced to close temporarily due to the ongoing COVID- pandemic.“Although we had taken the decision to close temporarily, we wanted to do something to help in providing a product or service for our incredible NHS staff and care workers,” explained Harold. “With the urgent need for scrubs so highly documented, we knew this was something practical that we could help with.”With many fabric manufacturers also closed temporarily, Harold struggled to source a bulk fabric initially, until he spoke to Kevin Devlin, managing director of fabric manufacturer William Clark and Sons in Upperlands, Maghera.“Kevin kindly agreed to bring back some of his staff to produce the fabric we neededwe placed a minimum order of , metres,” continued Harold. “A friend immediately launched a fundraising campaign to raise the five-figure sum required to buy the fabric and, within days, we exceeded our target thanks to the kindness and generosity of hundreds of people.”“We had then started to cut and distribute the fabrics within our own factory to enable our stitcher volunteers to get to work. With the demand being so pressing, however, we had to switch to auto machine cutting of the scrubs, working with Bradfor’s from Rostrevor, who kindly offered their services free of charge. This allowed the , metres of fabric to be cut into pieces ready for stitching.”Harold and Alison distributed the fabric to what they described as “an exceptional band of stitchers”, made up of over  volunteers spread right across Mid and East Antrim – including Ballymena, Broughshane, Cullybackey, Cloughmills, Ahoghill and Larne. Groups involved included ‘Bannside Stitchers’, ‘Cloughmills Crochet Club’ and ‘Tullygarley Sewing Group’.“We are deeply indebted to each and every person involved either with the groups or as iniduals for their help and expertise,” said Harold. “Many of these amazing women are well over the age of  themselves and have been in isolation for weeks. With many of them professional stitchers from days gone by, the speed at which they have been able to work is outstanding and the workmanship and quality coming back from them is absolutely impeccable.“This project has had a hugely positive impact on them in one way or another. As well as being physically unwell, many of them were feeling very down and isolated by the ongoing lockdown. The opportunity to use their talent and skill in this way has really brought new le to them.”Harold and Alison have been operating a drop off and pick up service, distributing fabric to stitchers across the borough and picking up dozens of pairs of completed scrubs just days later.Over , pairs of scrubs are now in the process of being distributed, with some having gone already to Antrim and Causeway Hospitals and a number of nursing homes in Mid and East Antrim, as well as in Lisburn and Belfast.A collective statement from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Group Party Leaders – Councillors Gregg McKeen, Timothy Gaston, Keith Turner, Gerardine Mulvenna, Eugene Reid and James McKeown – praised Harold and Alison and their group of volunteers for their efforts.“In recent weeks we have seen many fantastic examples of businesses in Mid and East Antrim being proactive and really going out to their way to do anything they can to help in the fight against COVID-.“Harold and Alison McCloy, their ‘band of stitchers’ and all those who helped with this project in any way, are to be commended for this remarkable display of thoughtfulness, selflessness and generosity. Exemplying the outward-looking values that characterise the people of Mid and East Antrim, their kindness will be felt by hundreds of frontline NHS and care workers at a time of great need.”Harold and Alison are continuing to raise funds throughout the campaign, with new project being planned to help the NHS and local charities.

Learn to switch out of work-modeThe biggest challenge for working parents is learning to switch between two dferent mindsets - work-mode and parent-mode.When we#re in work-mode, we tend to be very goal-focused and task-oriented. But when it comes to family le, children need us to deploy dferent strengths.They need emotionally attuned parents who are curious, playful and empathetic, who can slow down and prioritise connecting and listening over getting the job done.Children are naturally chaotic and focused on the moment. If we approach them stuck in our efficiency-focused work-mode, we quickly get frustrated with them.. Make space for playfulnessPlayfulness is an essential ingredient in happy families. Children and adults need it. If you take the playfulness out of parenting, all you#re left with is drudgery.Playfulness isn#t the same as doing lots of activities. Cajoling a herd of children in and out of the car to ballet rehearsals and football matches when lockdown is over doesn#t add up to a fun family le. Similarly, while we might be stuck indoors a bit more at the moment, a bit of silliness is good for everyone.Creating more space for playfulness will give you room to breathe, to relax, to laugh a little moreand enjoy being a member of your family.. Prioritise quality momentsWhen we#re stuck in get-the-job-done work-mode, we tend to focus on all those tasks that need completing during family time. Feeding, washing, laundry, spelling homework, reading, telling off, chasing down lost items...But families are made up of relationships, not tasks. If we sht our thinking about parenting away from a list of activities to be completed or a project to be undertaken and see our job as parents in terms of building relationships with our children, that opens the door to a very dferent dynamic.Building a relationship is about chatting, laughing and slowing down for a few minutes to listen when our children have something to say - really listening with all our attention, not just half our brains. It#s through listening that we connect with our children on a deeper level and get to know them.. Use your attention smartlyWhen we#re busy, it#s easy to slip into the trap of ignoring children when they#re being good and overreacting to behaviour we don#t like. Your attention means everything to your children and they#ll do pretty much anything to get it.Working parents are often racked with guilt about not being able to give their children enough attention. But it#s not how much attention we give that#s the crucial issue, it#s where we direct it.Creating a happy family dynamic isn#t about finding extra hours or minutes, it#s about parenting smarter by targeting your attention towards the behaviour you want to encourage.. Set children up to succeedAvoid constant firefighting by setting some clear, simple and positive ground rules. Children are used to having golden rules at school or nursery, so have some at home too. The best rules help children focus on what good behaviour looks like, so they do it more often.If the kids are bickering, introduce a ground rule like #be a team# to encourage alternative behaviour. If mean comments are the issue, then #use kind words# might be a good rule. Or,physical aggression is the problem, #be gentle#.. Don#t try to do it allParental involvement is a great thing, but taking over and doing too much for our children isn#t good for them. Running around picking up after children who are old enough to do things for themselves is not an act of love, it#s an act of developmental sabotage.It means you#ll never have enough time to enjoy being a member of your family.Sometimes, when it comes to parenting, less really is more.The Work Parent Switch by Anita Cleare is published by Vermilion on April , £.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo Stephen Davison Pacemaker PressBy Lisa SmythApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland may have to remain in lockdown until July, according to a Northern Ireland expert in viral epidemics.However, Dr Michael Donnelly said removing social isolation measures slowly and carefully could potentially stop a second surge of the deadly virus.Dr Donnelly, a clinical epidemiologist, said it is imperative that people across Northern Ireland are not complacent when it comes to reducing the spread of coronavirus.He was speaking as figures released on Sunday revealed one further person has died from Covid-, bringing to  the number of people here who have lost their lives during the pandemic.Read MoreDr Michael Donnelly:Opinion We must brace ourselves for an onslaught of Covid- cases but by July the worst will be overThere is still very much we don#t know about this virus, said Dr Donnelly.There are some people who will become infected who get a temperature and a slight cough and there are other people who it will kill.We still don#t have effective treatments, we can give patients paracetamol and oxygen, but we#re finding out that ventilators that we had pinned so much hope on might not be as effective as we first thought.Research has shown that % of patients who are ventilated end up dying.There are going to be signicant measures in place for some time yet, it#s important that we don#t jump the gun. There will be a very high price to paywe get it wrong.We#re already looking at what has gone wrong, but I would say the biggest mistake that has been made has been to not take this virus seriously enough.This isn#t a rehearsal, this is real and people are dying. We are beginning to see less people dying, but that doesn#t mean we can relax.It might be inconvenient to have to stay at home, but the choice is very simple. If sitting in the house for a few weeks is the price you have to pay to stay alive, it seems to me to be a fairly good price. You will have the rest of your le to make up for isolating now.While statistics released by the Public Health Agency on Sunday show  people in Northern Ireland have now died, the total death toll is likely to be signicantly higher.This follows the publication of new figures on Friday, showing Covid- deaths were a third higher than originally reported.Another  people have tested positive for the virus, bringing the total to ,, with a total of , iniduals tested.Dr Donnelly said he believes increasing the number of people being tested for the virus, as well as establishing who has immunity, will play a crucial role in lting lockdown measures.He said officials should use antigen and antibody tests that have already been developed, despite concerns about their effectiveness.We don#t have the luxury of time to make sure they are perfect, he said.We have to use what is available to us now. However, he stressed it is vital that a vaccine is safe to use.If we are rolling this out to millions of people we don#t want to find out that it is harmful, he said.Despite this, he said he is optimistic that a vaccine can be found before the end of the year.Although he warned that it may have to be altered each year, similarly to the influenza vaccination.He continued: If we open everything up gradually, we can stop a second wave.I would like to think we will be through this by the first week in July and similarly I would like to think that people who are shielding will also be able to begin toto normal.The key to this is testing who has the virus and establishing who has had the virus and has some immunity, but it is important that we remove social distancing measures slowly.Officials are coming under increasing pressure to reveal their exit strategy once the predicted surge is over, amid claims the Cabinet is split over whether to risk more deaths to save the plunging economy.Speaking at the daily briefing in London on Sunday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson dismissed calls to spell out the exit strategy from coronavirus lockdown - despite claims ministers in England want schools to reopen after May .Mr Williamson told the daily Downing Street briefing he was sorry that children were having to suffer through the crisis but would not give a date for aof schools.Meanwhile, the Department of Education has not responded to a similar query over when schools here may reopen, or whether it has ruled out the possibility of pupils ing to classrooms before September.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those workers are based in the Northern sector which takes in Derry, Strabane and Limavady. It comes after the Derry News revealed earlier this month that  workers were off across the Trust area because of COVID- - the illness that can affect your lungs and airways which is caused by coronavirus. Of those employees,  worked at Altnagelvin Hospital. There was a relatively even split between the numbers self-isolating due to symptoms of their own and those isolating because family members had symptoms. googletag.cmd.push Testing has been ramped up in dferent parts of NI, including Derry where a facility has just opened at City of Derry Rugby Club, to ensure that health and social care staff are kept safe. It is also hoped that testing will allow staff who are following government guidelines by isolating - but are not actually sick - toto work so they can assist during the first wave of coronavirus cases. However, according to the latest figures available  staff members are still absent. In a statement to the Derry News on Friday, a spokesperson for the Western Trust confirmed: “Whilst a number of staff have ed to work following a period of absence some staff have commenced new episodes of absence related to coronavirus. googletag.cmd.push “The total number of staff absent as at th April is . Since the introduction of testing on th March  and up to th April  a total of  Northern Sector staff have been tested – this covers both hospital and community staff.” Approximately , people responded to a workforce appeal by the Trust to allow it to cope with an increased demand on services in light of the coronavirus pandemic. That included retired doctors and student nurses who have joined the frontline. A quarter of those applicants have commenced work in a range of roles. A spokesperson explained. “The Trust recently launched a workforce appeal for staff and have appointed  staff to date. “The recruitment team is continuing to process a large number of applications.” Northern Ireland is nearing the end of what was described as the first wave of cases which was expected to peak between April -. Under this ‘reasonable worst case scenario’, the projected number of cumulative COVID- deaths in Northern Ireland over  weeks of the epidemic would be ,. The latest Public Health Agencybulletin, as of April , reports  deaths. It is believed that this peak may be less severe than first anticipated but last Thursday saw the highest daily rise with  COVID related deaths in NI hospitals. That total was matched on Friday and a further  people tested positive, a development Health Minister Robin Swann described was a ‘wake up call’ as he warned against complacency. On Saturday a further  deaths were registered and one more person was added to the overall death toll on Sunday. TESTING Almost , people have been tested for COVID- in Northern Ireland - over , of them health care workers. The current target is set at over , tests per day with a view to scaling up over time and expanding priority groups. The test centre at City of Derry Rugby Club will assist with that upscaling. Criticism has been levelled at the government for limited testing in the community and contact tracing as that will be crucial when it comes to estimating population immunity and designing an exit strategy to move out of the current lockdown. Speaking last week Minister of Health Robin Swann said: “Testing of health care workers has been a key priority of mine and I am glad that in recent weeks we have tested over , of our frontline staff. “That’s important for them, and it’s also important for the people they support such as the residents in our care homes.” He continued: ”An expert working group has also been established to lead on the expansion of testing across all our laboratory services, both within Health and Social Care facilities, and also to consider options for the utilisation of other testing facilities including within the commercial sector. “There is a NI Testing Strategy that has already been shared with the Executive and the Health Committee. In that I have made it clear that the overall testing policy will be adjusted over time as testing capacity increases, and priority groups for testing are expanded. “Similarly the strategy also includes a pledge that testing will soon move towards surveillance of COVID- in the population to inform planning of services including surge capacity, and to estimate population immunity.“  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chandigarh in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

To this day, the  All-Ireland winning team remains Derrys flagship group. The foundations were dug long before Anthony Tohill plucked both throw-ins in the lashing rain of Newry, that started the ball rolling towards Sam. This week Michael McMullan delves deeper, back to where it all began. On that famous September Sunday in , Seamus Downey nipped between Mark OConnor and John Kerins before fisting Damian Cassidys cross-shot to set off an explosion of red and white on Hill  behind. It was the final shudder Derry needed to wade clear of the early Cork storm and en their strides towards Sam Maguire. googletag.cmd.push Every dream begins somewhere. The s was greeted with a raft of MacRory and Hogan Cups, following on from St Pius Vocational Schools glory. Added in was an Ulster U title and four All-Ireland minor final appearances – producing two wins. It was a golden era that helped assemble the crux of a team that would dine at the top table for most of a decade. Tradition emerges in cycles. The s saw Derry seniors regularly at Croke Park. They lost a NFL final to the Dubs, won three Ulster senior titles, losing a further two finals. It was a team that Mick ODwyer termed the greatest team never to win footballs top prize. Their example, inspired the generation coming after them. googletag.cmd.push But Derrys waves of success had already begun. St Columbs Derry won the MacRory and Hogan Cup in , the same year Tommy Diamond captained the Oaks minor crop to the Tom Markham Cup. An All-Ireland U followed three years later. It was natural progression. This success, needed inspiration to come from somewhere. Its about having an example to follow. They needed the earliest pioneers to put Derry football on the map. *** According to Derry GAAs history book, produced in , the first official county board meeting took place in September . All six clubs present have since dissolved, but of the  present at the start of , only Claudy and Foreglen exist to this day. St Patricks Waterside are credited by the Derry People with having the first team to represent the county, when they played Strabane in a game at Lford. After nine attempts to get the GAA fully operational, in a period that saw Derry win two Ulster hurling championships and reach four football finals, it wasnt here to stay until . Ulster Council official Benny Fay, of Cavan, organised an exhibition game between Newbridge and Ballinderry. After the game, the county board was formed of  officials, two from each club. In May that year, Derry beat Antrim in the opening round of the Ulster junior championship, before beating Tyrone in the semi-final, but they lost to Donegal in the decider. Later, in , they entered the league but were defeated by Tyrone in their first game. It was the start. In  a new city board emerged and their secretary, Sean Dolan, later presided over a meeting in Claudy to elect a North Derry board. By , the county had entered its first minor team which would supply seven players to the senior team who began the building process. It also contained future GAA President Paddy McFlynn. It wasnt until the s that titles began to regularly arrive. It was a spell when Derry won the Ulster junior championship, the now defunct Dr Lagan Cup , the Dr McKenna Cup and pride of place - the  NFL title.   NFL Champions From that team, goalkeeper Charlie Moran, Sonny McCann, John Eddie Mullan, Mickey McNaught and Roddy Gribbin would form the spine of a team that took Derry into the next decade. They reached the league semi-final of , only to be narrowly beaten by All-Ireland champions Meath. The same year, a strong junior team lost to Mayo in the All-Ireland final and three years later, the seniors pushed a star-studded Cavan team all the way in a league game. The momentum was building with every passing year. In , Derry beat Armagh in the Dr McKenna Cup, just nine months after the Orchard side had contested an All-Ireland final with Kerry. Twelve months later, in , a win over Armagh would see Derry contest their first Ulster senior final since . No longer was the top level of provincial football a one-game season, before being knocked out on their ear. Derry were beginning to challenge. In the decider, they came up against a Cavan team in search of their th title. Derry had seven of the team that would play in their first ever All-Ireland senior final four years later. They gave the Breffni men all they wanted before going down - to -. The winners had Peter ODonohue to thank for his display of accuracy from frees. Derry were getting closer and closer. The  season ended with another appearance in the final, this time going down to Tyrone by two points. Their time was just around the corner. *** The  season was the best in Derrys history, at the time, but it began in the unfamiliar surroundings under the Twin Towers of Wembley Stadium. The British GAA rented the iconic venue to host a tournament, known as Wembley at Whit. It became a hit and lasted until the s. Derry took the field before Galway, in front of an attendance of ,, making them the first ever GAA team to step on the hallowed Wembley turf. The Tribesmen lted Sam two years earlier and ran out eight point winners over a Derry team on the rise. The  season saw Derry win both the Dr McKenna and the Dr Lagan Cups. It was on the championship stage where they laid their greatest stamp. Derry opened with a narrow three-point win over neighbours Antrim at Casement Park. It was all the more signicant, as the Oakleafers had to come from behind in the closing stages. It set up a clash with Cavan in the semi-final, who took three games to get over Monaghan. Derry started sluggishly against the Ulster kingpins before pulling away to book their place in the final. It was a novel pairing with Derry and Down both vying for a first title. It was manager Roddy Gribbins side who came out on the right side of the battle in Clones . The Ulster champions were now poised for an All-Ireland semi-final clash with Kerry. Before that, Derry played the Dr McKenna Cup final in early August, something that would be unheard of now. They hammered Armagh - to -. *** It set Derry up for the biggest game in their history. After years challenging at All-Ireland junior level, this was the pinnacle. And it was Kerry standing in their way. In their ranks were newcomers Mick ODwyer at wing back and Mick OConnell in attack. On a tricky day for football, the Kingdom began with the first of two Tadhgie Lyne goals and led - to -. By half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead. The Oakleafers matched a fancied Kerry side every step of the way and went into a four point lead before Lyne grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on in the final moments to book their place in the final on a - to - scoreline. It was time to challenge for Sam. Derry were a young side, but benefited from the experience and nous of manager Roddy Gribbin, who would come on later in the final, to bring down the curtain on a  year senior career. The Dubs were primed after losing the  final to Kerry and nine of the starting team were back, including Kevin Heffernan, Paddy Haughey and ace free-taker Ollie Freaney. Dublin had the wind at their backs and attacked the Hill  end in the first half. Haugheys control on the ground set up Heffo for a point to settle down the home side. It took an angled kick from Brendan Murray to get the Oaks off the mark. But back came Dublin and led - to - at one point in the first half, with Freaney and John Timmons doing much of the damage. Derry began to find their feet, but were wasteful in front of goal. Up popped Dinny McKeever to notch their second point, before two Sean OConnell points had his side within a goal of the Dubs. The interval lead was - to -. OConnell was on target early in the second half, but Derry needed a Patsy Gormley save to deny full-forward Johnny Joyce.  The build-up to Owen Gribbins goal Another OConnell free had Derry back to within the kick of a ball. Then they were level. Twenty-five years before Downeys fisted goal, Derry were again attacking the Railway goals. Owen Gribbin did the spadework earlier in the move. Chuck Higgins and Brian Mullan went close in a goalmouth scramble before Owen Gribbin finished to the net. The sides were level - to -. They needed a break to swing their control into something that would ask questions of Dublin. Their brief glimmer of hope was quashed when Des Ferguson goaled for Dublin shortly after. The changing of the game as the introduction of Maurice Whelan to the Dublin defence, allowing Lar Foley to push towards midfield where he negated the influence of Jim McKeever. A second Dublin goal pushed the margin to eight points, but OConnell and Owen Gribbin, with a fisted effort, rounded off the scoring, but Dublin were - to - wi nners. McKeevers performances in the All-Ireland series saw him awarded the first Texaco award for player of the year. Later in the season, Derry completed the treble of Ulster titles by seeing off Donegal in the final of the Dr Lagan Cup. It couldve been a perfect season, but instead it laid the foundations for the success that followed.

To be honest though, it’s easy. Derry is, in fact, unique because there isn’t another club championship in Ireland that has hosted Enda Muldoon or Patsy Bradley. And when I saw that I’ve compiled a club All-Star team without Conleth Gilligan or Shane McGuigan or Benny Heron or Emmett McGuckin, I thought two things. One, I hate myself. And two, Derry club football is special. . Eoin Mailey After  seasons playing senior football with Ardmore, Eoin Mailey has always stood out as a man who could cut it at any level. It would be an insult to a goalkeeper of such calibre and experience for me to list out the qualities that made him a top class number one. Just know he has them all. googletag.cmd.push h. Oisiacuten Duffy At St. Columb’s College, Oisiacuten was a dogged defender who’d stick to his man and guarantee you that no forward being shadowed by him would enjoy his day. In the space of a couple of years, he went from being a brilliant corner back to a dominant central player, so inspiring and so important in defence and attack. . Brendan Rogers When was the last time a full back caused the opposition such panic and headaches in the build-up to big games  Brendan Rogers has shut down the best forwards in the country but he has also been one of Slaughtneil’s most valuable players in transition. When he pumps the afterburners, it’s like he’s gliding up pitch on a moped. googletag.cmd.push . Gareth McKinless McKinless is nearly sadistic with the pleasure he derives from crushing the best laid plans of an enthusiastic attacker. As far back as  when he was switched on to Michael Murphy in Omagh, he’s been an irreplaceable hammer in the Ballinderry arsenal, used wherever they’ve needed him to bring the pain. . Jimmy O’Connor When I was younger, I had this idea in my head that top football players without exception had to be six feet tall and weighing  stone. Then I got roasted by Jimmy O’Connor. And for over a decade, I’ve seen him terrorise junior and intermediate teams from wing back – and he was doing it before wing backs were supposed to. . Chrissy McKaigue Tireless, supremely intelligent and, most importantly, uncompromising. Slaughtneil took their championship tally from one to five in four years, winning three Ulster titles and winning the adoration of everyone in the nation. Chrissy McKaigue was the face of that revolution and he was the beating heart of it too. . Paul Cartin Legend has it that, on a calm and clear day on the River Foyle, you can still hear the faint echo of the whelps that followed Paul Cartin’s shoulder tackle on Joe Diver in the quarter-final in Celtic Park in . Banagher’s daring dreams might’ve been futile in the end, but stories will be told about Paul Cartin long after we forget who won and lost. . Patsy Bradley Remember Mary K Burke’s photo of Patsy Bradley flying horizontally above Ballinderry heads through the air to get a finger nail on the ball  Take that action, multiply it by  minutes and multiply that by  years and you’re not even close to Patsy Bradley yet. Heart, hands, hardcore athleticism. The best ball-winner, in the air and in defence. . Enda Muldoon For all the big moments, Enda Muldoon was orchestrating them. It was his back-spinned pass to Raymie Wilkinson that finally undid Banagher in . It was his telepathic diagonal ball for Collie Devlin that broke Slaughtneil. It was Muldoon in the sky, it was Muldoon taking hits to free others, it was even Muldoon at  controlling the play. It was always Muldoon. . Niall McNicholl Captained Castledawson to their first ever championship title in  and led them with utter distinction on their road to a another two. A player who always managed to find time on the ball and a player who always managed to get on the ball even with all the work he subjected himself to. . Chrissy Bradley They’re still researching how a man with so many target dots on his head can still find so much space and freedom. You don’t win four championships in succession without top class forwards and, as a scorer and as a playmaker, Sammy Bradley has been one of the best throughout Slaughtneil’s rise. . Sean Leo McGoldrick Sean Leo McGoldrick is just better than you or I at football. It’s just easy for him. Imagine how you see the game, on and off the ball, Sean Leo sees that same game in at least  per cent slower motion. He’s been unfalteringly exceptional for Eoghan Rua – as he was for Derry. . Lee Moore Lee Moore is one tough football player. He’s not a Fancy Dan corner forward who needs sunshine and hard ground to excel. He can win dirty ball , he can hold his own and no matter the day he’ll still be one of the most lethally accurate kickers of a ball you’ll see. . Colm McGoldrick I think I’ve played against Colm McGoldrick four times and, no exaggeration, I have never laid a hand on him. I’ve tried to tackle him, loads of times, but failed at every chance to even touch him. It’s freakish how powerful he is yet so evasive at the same time. The football he’s played for Eoghan Rua was at a standard that would’ve ripped inter-county defenders apart. . Eoin Bradley Throughout the first half of the decade, Eoin Bradley was showing in so many dferent games that he was one of the finest footballers in the land. Glenullin might not have enjoyed much success in that time but Bradley was unmarkable – at ,  or . It was carnage what he was doing to teams and almost poetic that he was fighting losing battles despite taking scalps all around him.

Schools officially closed because of the coronavirus pandemic on March . At the time, key workers were told that schools would remain open to provide supervised learning only for children who ‘absolutely need to attend’. Some parents have had dficulty finding places for their children including senior health care workers in the city. A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “Figures collected for Wednesday  April for Derry City and Strabane District Council showed that  schools responded to a daily survey as being open, with  children reported as attending open schools.

Figures collected for the same day the previous week show that there were  children reported as being in open schools. “An interactive map displaying schools open for supervised learning can be accessed on the Education Authority website.

Terence McMacken played in the first ever game, has been player of the year and now holds the position of club secretary. He spoke to Michael McMullan... Last September, a bumper attendance flocked to a packed Roe Park Hotel in Limavady to mark  years of Dungiven Celtic. A celebration of a story that evolved from early jottings in the late s, before the club stretched its wings to fly to the top of intermediate football by the early noughties. The thriving youth scene means Dungiven Celtic is here to stay. Its all thanks to the people involved, according to club stalwart and current secretary Terence McMacken, as he carries the baton held by his late father John Joe. googletag.cmd.push All-time leading goalscorer Seamus Harkin is now the club chairman. Every week, the club fields seven -a-side teams, now has added a snowballing girls soccer string to its bow - under the leadership of James Doran - and last year hosted almost  kids at their annual summer camp. Currently, like every sporting venue around the globe, their Ballyguddin home lies dormant. The lock-down has left the sporting landscape a deserted one. For Dungiven Celtic, its a pit stop on a race that began in June . “Back then, there was a lot of summer soccer played,”McMacken outlines. “We played summer cups and people who were enthusiastic about the game got involved. Every townland would have had a team.” googletag.cmd.push Feeny FC were in vogue, playing their games where Banaghers Fr McNally Park is now situated. Many players from the Dungiven area would have turned out for them. They had the makings of a decent side, but soon dissolved. Almost immediately, Dernaflaw Rovers sprung up, playing mainly in cup competitions before the realisation dawned of a hunger for more action in a more regular and organised format. There was the inkling to join the Derry and District Sunday morning leaguefor the start of the   season. “A meeting was called in Sam ODonnells house and that is how it started.” McMacken adds. “Sam had played on the Feeny team at the time.” And there it was, Dungiven Celtic was founded. *** With the clubs green and white hooped jerseys on order from Seamus Dorans sports shop in Dungiven, the club kicked off their existence in ODonnells red and white striped kit. By the end of that season, the club were in the green, white and black colours associated with the club to this very day. It all began with a trip to the Brandywell on Sunday, August ,  for the clubs first game, against Moville who were one of the Donegal teams in the DD league. Vinny Hargan scored a hat-trick in the - win. Between the posts was Dungiven and Derry Gaelic goalkeeper John Sommers. Also on the team were stalwarts Gerard Kelly and Terence McMacken. “We didnt really know what to expect,” McMacken recalls. “We had played in friendlies at the time, there was no real social media, so we thought this would be a good Moville team wed be playing against. “We played very well. We may have been a bit inconsistent, but we had a lot of good footballers around here and were better than we gave ourselves credit for.” By the end of , the club won their first trophy when they ed victorious from the Brandywell with the McKinney Cup thanks to two goals from Hugh Doherty. “We beat Brandywell Harpsin the final and they were the top team in the city at the time, so that was a big win,” McMacken adds. Saturday football then began, when the club entered a team into the North West senior league, with many of the players mixing it with a DD game on a Sunday, as well as playing Gaelic games. At the age of , Gerry McElhinney came to play for Dungiven Celtic. He would be waiting at Park bridge every Saturday where he would be collected for a game. By , he was an all-star Gaelic footballer with Derry and was playing on loan from Celtic at Finn Harps. “From Dungiven Celtic, Gerry moved to Distillery and was playing very well for them before being snapped up by Bolton Wanderers,” recalls McMacken. “I can alsoremember Anthony Tohillplaying for Park out at Ballyguddin on the Saturday before he went on trial at Manchester United.” By the end of the s, there was talk of a new Northern Ireland Intermediate league on the horizon. “It was for clubs who were quite ambitious,” McMacken begins. “The Irish league, at a higher level, was a closed shop. There were local clubs, who wanted to play at a higher level, but had no outlet. Some people in the club said well not and others wanted to give it a go and see where it goes.” It was the beginning of the climb. *** In August , Jack Doherty was Dungivens goalscorer in a - defeat to Cookstown United at the Curragh Road in the intermediate league cup. The next leg of the journey began. In the team was Scot Dougie Wood, who had spells with Sunderland and Raith Rovers, before moving to Ireland, where he won both league and cup honours with Derry City. “He came to us in his mid-s and was Dungiven Celtics player manager until he was around ,” McMacken states. The clubs longest serving manager Jim McGroarty then came on board. A Lettershandoney man, he played with Finn Harps before going over the water to Stoke City. After ato Ireland, he had a spell with Sligo Rovers before going back to the Harps. “When we won our first intermediate trophy , we beat Derry City in the final of the North West Challenge Cup,” McMacken adds. “Dougie had stepped down as manager, Jim was back playing for Sligo on a Sunday, so he took over as manager.” Another constant during that era was Martin Hazlett, who sadly passed away last year. Terence McMackens diligent record keeping charts Hazletts  appearances for the club. He played in the clubs first game at intermediate level, was player of the year in the  season and picked up the award for the sixth time, some  years later.  Martin Hazlett celebrates cup glory for Dungiven Was he the clubs greatest player  “There is no doubt about it, he was a wonderful player,” came McMackens prompt reply. “He always came to play a game properly prepared and he was always in good shape. He took his football seriously and I always thought he couldve played where – a higher level.” Hazlett was very much a home bird and lived beside the pitch, playing right up until the clubs golden era at the late s and was the glue to pull the team together until the younger crop game along. “We had always had decent teams, but theleague was of a very high standard. Quite a number of the teams, they had people getting paid and were professional teams. We were holding our own, but were never good enough to win it.” In the Irish Cup, the club had two impressive runs during the s. They reached the sixth round in the   season, before going down to Loughgall. Along the way, they defeated local rivals Limavady United. The following season, they took on Irish League champions Crusaders at Seaview, going down - after giving a good account of themselves. It helped keep the momentum going and after knocking on the door for a few years, Intermediate league success was to follow. *** In the beginning, Dungiven Celtic played their games between the county school, a pitch on the Hass Road and on the Garvagh Road, where Paacuteirc na nOacuteg Gaelic pitch is now situated. “The council bought a field up at the Curragh Road and it has been developed into the Sport Centre,” McMacken points out. “Then we moved to Ballyguddin. We rented it for years and we eventually bought it and developed it. It was a field with fencing around. In , they dug it up and made a pitch out of it.” Terences father, John Joe, had got involved in the club after ing from Belfast where he was working and supporting Belfast Celtic. He was following the Derry and Dungiven GAA teams, before being asked to get involved in Dungiven Celtic. “He played major role in the club from then on. He kept it going in bad times during the troubles, when it was tough going,” said Terence, who later wrote a poem as a tribute to his late father. “He didnt get to see the pitch finished. When they came into work on the pitch, he died a week after.” Terence now looks after the pitch. Seamus Harkin hails the endless hours he puts into it. “Youll probably find him out there any way, just making sure it is in pristine condition.” Dermott McCloskey was another who poured his le into the club after his playing days, whether it was coaching or whatever needed done. “Dermott was a big influence in procuring the pitch on a permanent basis and developing it,” McMacken adds. Another club stalwart remembered at the club dinner was Patsy Donaghy. Not many Dungiven Celtic players will remember him not being around the club during his letime. He famously reminded Gerard Kelly to stay on his feet. “Get up Kelly, you need studs on your arse,” he would say. “Patsy was a permanent fixture,” McMacken recalls. “He never played, but he was the club linesman – one of those guys. Every club has them...and the flag was pointing one way most of the time.” So many offered time over the years to take Dungiven Celtic from Sam McDonnells house to their new home at Ballyguddin, but by the early s the first team was really beginning to come of age. McMacken, who would rather be watching the local underage blossom than watching soccer on the telly, remembers being down at the pitch one Saturday as the they young guns began to filter into the first team. An onlooker expressed how well the team was playing. “Ill tell you what...youve a team there for  years,” McMacken was told. And so there was. Of the  players that formed the crux of that squad about  of them wouldve been there all the way through. For most of a decade. “You might have had the odd boy going away to England or America, but it was dferent times then – boys were there to train and to play,” McMacken added. “We had a lot of boys playing Gaelic and hurling, they mixed it up the best. All three codes were doing very well. “The fact it was a community thing means there were days when you had to do without guys, thats the way it has to be.” It brought McMacken to the story of a weekend when Dungiven Celtic were down to play an Irish Cup tie in Belfast against Donegal Celtic, on the same Saturday Dungivens Gaelic team were set to play Bellaghy. The Belfast club accepted the request for an earlier kick-off to accommodate five players to jump into a car and head to Bellaghy. “We won -, they were a really good team. It was an outstanding game and our boys were shattered after it,” said McMacken. Emmett McKeever was man of the match and was one of the players on their way to Bellaghy for part two of their super Saturday. Dungiven beat Bellaghy and later the that night, McMacken was informed that McKeever was the star of the show for the second time that day. “I didnt even know how he was able to walk again after the way he played. There was two games where he was man of the match in one day.” It was the   season when the breakthrough came with the clubs first intermediate League title. They lost only once, to Strabane, during their -game march to glory. They were - down in one game, away to Roe Valley, before Seamus Harkins hat-trick pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. Harkin bagged another two goals in another important clash, as Celtic saw off Dergview and they never looked back. The following season was an even better one, with all three teams – firsts, reserves and thirds – all winning their respective league titles. The firsts needed to avoid defeat in the final game of the season in a decider with Strabane, a game that ended scoreless, and Dungiven had retained their title. Six days later a - win over Park saw the reserves crowned champions and the thirds made it a clean sweep, but they did it the hard way. After going six games without a win, they won  of the remaining  games. The firsts added the intermediate challenge cup and the McGrogan Memorial Cup, to round off a season that brought five trophies. After the gap of a year, Dungiven came back to win their third Intermediate League title to cement it as the clubs most memorable period. Fast forward to the present day and the future looks equally rosy. In recent years, the club were honoured by the IFA as the Club of the Year. “Dungiven Celtic Football has consistently excelled in its work for youth football in the local area,” read part of the response from the judging . “The club’s community work has also been exemplary having successfully managed to build signicant participation in the local area.” After becoming an established club, the award rubber-stamps their commitment to the future “We have come a long way and it can fall apart very quickly,” is the take of Terence McMacken. “It is like any other club, it depends on the people. We are lucky at the moment, we have very good people involved. What we have....one, two or three people couldnt do.” He refers to the parental support and how the club is run very much on the GAA model, for the community and with everyone rowing in behind each other. McMacken refers to other clubs in Dungivens league paying their players, but he is adamant their way is the one that needs to remain. “Theyhave loyalty, that is the big thing. It is hard to get that in soccer. It is a dferent game, there are dferent rules and it is run dferently. “We are playing teams on Saturdays where players are getting paid, where our guys are putting in a fiver to play. It is a thing we think is right.” The money goes towards the running of the club and all the admin fees that are hidden from the eye of a player every Saturday. The underage players all contribute a pound, which helps towards the booking of training facilities. Other clubs have players getting offered money here and there with goal bonuses. “Then there are clubs, like ourselves, who arent. I wouldnt like to see it changed. You are asking them to be part of a club, to sell tickets or whatever, the same as the six-year-olds.” The balls might be flying around Ballyguddin before the season is out, but the chances are they wont as players are kept tucked up at home for the safety of the nation in the facing the coronavirus outbreak. When the action s, the surface will be like a carpet and there will be smiles on the kids faces as they mix with their peers once again. The meeting in Sean ODonnells house was only the beginning. The club has been passed on, with interest. Its in a healthy state. Heres to the next  years.

Terence McMacken played in the first ever game, has been player of the year and now holds the position of club secretary. He spoke to Michael McMullan... Last September, a bumper attendance flocked to a packed Roe Park Hotel in Limavady to mark  years of Dungiven Celtic. A celebration of a story that evolved from early jottings in the late s, before the club stretched its wings to fly to the top of intermediate football by the early noughties. The thriving youth scene means Dungiven Celtic is here to stay. Its all thanks to the people involved, according to club stalwart and current secretary Terence McMacken, as he carries the baton held by his late father John Joe. googletag.cmd.push All-time leading goalscorer Seamus Harkin is now the club chairman. Every week, the club fields seven -a-side teams, now has added a snowballing girls soccer string to its bow - under the leadership of James Doran - and last year hosted almost  kids at their annual summer camp. Currently, like every sporting venue around the globe, their Ballyguddin home lies dormant. The lock-down has left the sporting landscape a deserted one. For Dungiven Celtic, its a pit stop on a race that began in June . “Back then, there was a lot of summer soccer played,”McMacken outlines. “We played summer cups and people who were enthusiastic about the game got involved. Every townland would have had a team.” googletag.cmd.push Feeny FC were in vogue, playing their games where Banaghers Fr McNally Park is now situated. Many players from the Dungiven area would have turned out for them. They had the makings of a decent side, but soon dissolved. Almost immediately, Dernaflaw Rovers sprung up, playing mainly in cup competitions before the realisation dawned of a hunger for more action in a more regular and organised format. There was the inkling to join the Derry and District Sunday morning leaguefor the start of the   season. “A meeting was called in Sam ODonnells house and that is how it started.” McMacken adds. “Sam had played on the Feeny team at the time.” And there it was, Dungiven Celtic was founded. *** With the clubs green and white hooped jerseys on order from Seamus Dorans sports shop in Dungiven, the club kicked off their existence in ODonnells red and white striped kit. By the end of that season, the club were in the green, white and black colours associated with the club to this very day. It all began with a trip to the Brandywell on Sunday, August ,  for the clubs first game, against Moville who were one of the Donegal teams in the DD league. Vinny Hargan scored a hat-trick in the - win. Between the posts was Dungiven and Derry Gaelic goalkeeper John Sommers. Also on the team were stalwarts Gerard Kelly and Terence McMacken. “We didnt really know what to expect,” McMacken recalls. “We had played in friendlies at the time, there was no real social media, so we thought this would be a good Moville team wed be playing against. “We played very well. We may have been a bit inconsistent, but we had a lot of good footballers around here and were better than we gave ourselves credit for.” By the end of , the club won their first trophy when they ed victorious from the Brandywell with the McKinney Cup thanks to two goals from Hugh Doherty. “We beat Brandywell Harpsin the final and they were the top team in the city at the time, so that was a big win,” McMacken adds. Saturday football then began, when the club entered a team into the North West senior league, with many of the players mixing it with a DD game on a Sunday, as well as playing Gaelic games. At the age of , Gerry McElhinney came to play for Dungiven Celtic. He would be waiting at Park bridge every Saturday where he would be collected for a game. By , he was an all-star Gaelic footballer with Derry and was playing on loan from Celtic at Finn Harps. “From Dungiven Celtic, Gerry moved to Distillery and was playing very well for them before being snapped up by Bolton Wanderers,” recalls McMacken. “I can alsoremember Anthony Tohillplaying for Park out at Ballyguddin on the Saturday before he went on trial at Manchester United.” By the end of the s, there was talk of a new Northern Ireland Intermediate league on the horizon. “It was for clubs who were quite ambitious,” McMacken begins. “The Irish league, at a higher level, was a closed shop. There were local clubs, who wanted to play at a higher level, but had no outlet. Some people in the club said well not and others wanted to give it a go and see where it goes.” It was the beginning of the climb. *** In August , Jack Doherty was Dungivens goalscorer in a - defeat to Cookstown United at the Curragh Road in the intermediate league cup. The next leg of the journey began. In the team was Scot Dougie Wood, who had spells with Sunderland and Raith Rovers, before moving to Ireland, where he won both league and cup honours with Derry City. “He came to us in his mid-s and was Dungiven Celtics player manager until he was around ,” McMacken states. The clubs longest serving manager Jim McGroarty then came on board. A Lettershandoney man, he played with Finn Harps before going over the water to Stoke City. After ato Ireland, he had a spell with Sligo Rovers before going back to the Harps. “When we won our first intermediate trophy , we beat Derry City in the final of the North West Challenge Cup,” McMacken adds. “Dougie had stepped down as manager, Jim was back playing for Sligo on a Sunday, so he took over as manager.” Another constant during that era was Martin Hazlett, who sadly passed away last year. Terence McMackens diligent record keeping charts Hazletts  appearances for the club. He played in the clubs first game at intermediate level, was player of the year in the  season and picked up the award for the sixth time, some  years later.  Martin Hazlett celebrates cup glory for Dungiven Was he the clubs greatest player  “There is no doubt about it, he was a wonderful player,” came McMackens prompt reply. “He always came to play a game properly prepared and he was always in good shape. He took his football seriously and I always thought he couldve played where – a higher level.” Hazlett was very much a home bird and lived beside the pitch, playing right up until the clubs golden era at the late s and was the glue to pull the team together until the younger crop game along. “We had always had decent teams, but theleague was of a very high standard. Quite a number of the teams, they had people getting paid and were professional teams. We were holding our own, but were never good enough to win it.” In the Irish Cup, the club had two impressive runs during the s. They reached the sixth round in the   season, before going down to Loughgall. Along the way, they defeated local rivals Limavady United. The following season, they took on Irish League champions Crusaders at Seaview, going down - after giving a good account of themselves. It helped keep the momentum going and after knocking on the door for a few years, Intermediate league success was to follow. *** In the beginning, Dungiven Celtic played their games between the county school, a pitch on the Hass Road and on the Garvagh Road, where Paacuteirc na nOacuteg Gaelic pitch is now situated. “The council bought a field up at the Curragh Road and it has been developed into the Sport Centre,” McMacken points out. “Then we moved to Ballyguddin. We rented it for years and we eventually bought it and developed it. It was a field with fencing around. In , they dug it up and made a pitch out of it.” Terences father, John Joe, had got involved in the club after ing from Belfast where he was working and supporting Belfast Celtic. He was following the Derry and Dungiven GAA teams, before being asked to get involved in Dungiven Celtic. “He played major role in the club from then on. He kept it going in bad times during the troubles, when it was tough going,” said Terence, who later wrote a poem as a tribute to his late father. “He didnt get to see the pitch finished. When they came into work on the pitch, he died a week after.” Terence now looks after the pitch. Seamus Harkin hails the endless hours he puts into it. “Youll probably find him out there any way, just making sure it is in pristine condition.” Dermott McCloskey was another who poured his le into the club after his playing days, whether it was coaching or whatever needed done. “Dermott was a big influence in procuring the pitch on a permanent basis and developing it,” McMacken adds. Another club stalwart remembered at the club dinner was Patsy Donaghy. Not many Dungiven Celtic players will remember him not being around the club during his letime. He famously reminded Gerard Kelly to stay on his feet. “Get up Kelly, you need studs on your arse,” he would say. “Patsy was a permanent fixture,” McMacken recalls. “He never played, but he was the club linesman – one of those guys. Every club has them...and the flag was pointing one way most of the time.” So many offered time over the years to take Dungiven Celtic from Sam McDonnells house to their new home at Ballyguddin, but by the early s the first team was really beginning to come of age. McMacken, who would rather be watching the local underage blossom than watching soccer on the telly, remembers being down at the pitch one Saturday as the they young guns began to filter into the first team. An onlooker expressed how well the team was playing. “Ill tell you what...youve a team there for  years,” McMacken was told. And so there was. Of the  players that formed the crux of that squad about  of them wouldve been there all the way through. For most of a decade. “You might have had the odd boy going away to England or America, but it was dferent times then – boys were there to train and to play,” McMacken added. “We had a lot of boys playing Gaelic and hurling, they mixed it up the best. All three codes were doing very well. “The fact it was a community thing means there were days when you had to do without guys, thats the way it has to be.” It brought McMacken to the story of a weekend when Dungiven Celtic were down to play an Irish Cup tie in Belfast against Donegal Celtic, on the same Saturday Dungivens Gaelic team were set to play Bellaghy. The Belfast club accepted the request for an earlier kick-off to accommodate five players to jump into a car and head to Bellaghy. “We won -, they were a really good team. It was an outstanding game and our boys were shattered after it,” said McMacken. Emmett McKeever was man of the match and was one of the players on their way to Bellaghy for part two of their super Saturday. Dungiven beat Bellaghy and later the that night, McMacken was informed that McKeever was the star of the show for the second time that day. “I didnt even know how he was able to walk again after the way he played. There was two games where he was man of the match in one day.” It was the   season when the breakthrough came with the clubs first intermediate League title. They lost only once, to Strabane, during their -game march to glory. They were - down in one game, away to Roe Valley, before Seamus Harkins hat-trick pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. Harkin bagged another two goals in another important clash, as Celtic saw off Dergview and they never looked back. The following season was an even better one, with all three teams – firsts, reserves and thirds – all winning their respective league titles. The firsts needed to avoid defeat in the final game of the season in a decider with Strabane, a game that ended scoreless, and Dungiven had retained their title. Six days later a - win over Park saw the reserves crowned champions and the thirds made it a clean sweep, but they did it the hard way. After going six games without a win, they won  of the remaining  games. The firsts added the intermediate challenge cup and the McGrogan Memorial Cup, to round off a season that brought five trophies. After the gap of a year, Dungiven came back to win their third Intermediate League title to cement it as the clubs most memorable period. Fast forward to the present day and the future looks equally rosy. In recent years, the club were honoured by the IFA as the Club of the Year. “Dungiven Celtic Football has consistently excelled in its work for youth football in the local area,” read part of the response from the judging . “The club’s community work has also been exemplary having successfully managed to build signicant participation in the local area.” After becoming an established club, the award rubber-stamps their commitment to the future “We have come a long way and it can fall apart very quickly,” is the take of Terence McMacken. “It is like any other club, it depends on the people. We are lucky at the moment, we have very good people involved. What we have....one, two or three people couldnt do.” He refers to the parental support and how the club is run very much on the GAA model, for the community and with everyone rowing in behind each other. McMacken refers to other clubs in Dungivens league paying their players, but he is adamant their way is the one that needs to remain. “Theyhave loyalty, that is the big thing. It is hard to get that in soccer. It is a dferent game, there are dferent rules and it is run dferently. “We are playing teams on Saturdays where players are getting paid, where our guys are putting in a fiver to play. It is a thing we think is right.” The money goes towards the running of the club and all the admin fees that are hidden from the eye of a player every Saturday. The underage players all contribute a pound, which helps towards the booking of training facilities. Other clubs have players getting offered money here and there with goal bonuses. “Then there are clubs, like ourselves, who arent. I wouldnt like to see it changed. You are asking them to be part of a club, to sell tickets or whatever, the same as the six-year-olds.” The balls might be flying around Ballyguddin before the season is out, but the chances are they wont as players are kept tucked up at home for the safety of the nation in the facing the coronavirus outbreak. When the action s, the surface will be like a carpet and there will be smiles on the kids faces as they mix with their peers once again. The meeting in Sean ODonnells house was only the beginning. The club has been passed on, with interest. Its in a healthy state. Heres to the next  years.

It is the latest jinx in a long series of mishaps which have bedevilled the garage proprietor.The Rice family moved to Drumaness in what seemed the final chapter in a long running wrangle over a smoke problem at their home in Carlisle Park, Ballynahinch.The fire destroyed almost everything and it was in response to the ldquoraw deal which Mr Rice was getting that the Drumaness committee was formed.The Drumaness Community Action Committee is only eight-strong, but a spokesman pointed out that they had the backing of the whole community.A collection was taken around the Drumaness district last week and raised more than pound for Mr Rice. Since then donations have been pouring in and already another pound has been collected.The spokesman added: ldquoWe think he [Mr Rice] is getting a raw deal and we are determined to do something about it.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Work is well underway on a pound, environmental improvement scheme for Ballynahinch Square.The scheme, which will give the much-maligned square a major facelt, has been brought about after much pressure from the local chamber of commerce.The chamber has been pushing for the resurfacing of the square for over a decade, but the breakthrough didnrsquot occur until late last year when negotiations between the owners, the Ker Estate, and the Department of the Environment were finally completed.The scheme will entail the resurfacing of the square, the planting of shrubs, the building of a lsquositting wallrsquo and the re-use of flower boxes. It is expected to be completed within several months.NEWCASTLE mdash The Northern Ireland Tourist Board is to pump pound, into Newcastlersquos Harry Ferguson Festival this summer.Newcastle Town Committee, organisers of the festival, were pleased to hear of the Boardrsquos agreement to sponsor entertainment at a cost of pound, when they met last week.More than half of this amount, which was requested by the Town Committee, will go towards bandstand entertainment.However, the committee also discussed a reply from Down District Council regarding pound, assistance towards the festival. They noted with regret that the council was again unable to give them any support.The committee agreed there was great interest in the town on their ambitious plans, particularly the initiative to build a replica of the Ferguson monoplane, and it was agreed that an appeal for funds to local businesses, hotels and guest houses would have to be made in the near future.Mr Fergusonrsquos daughter will be coming to Newcastle on July and it is hoped she will attend the Miss Newcastle ball, which will be held in the Slieve Donard Hotel that night, and the festival parade the following day.DOWNPATRICK mdash A call has been made this week for the public to help stamp out vandalism in the Downpatrick area.It comes from Downpatrick councillor, Mr Cecil Maxwell, who felt he had to speak out after three incidents at Downpatrick Cathedral last week when excrement was littered around the building.ldquoIt is sad that a holy place is vandalised, especially in Holy Week, he said. ldquoThe time has come for the general public to stop this sheer vandalism.Appealing for more co-operation from the public with the police, Mr Maxwell pointed out that other churches and schools in the area had also suffered severely at the hands of vandals.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar Choral Societyrsquos ninth annual concert, Sing A Rainbow, will be presented next Tuesday and Wednesday in the War Memorial Hall, Crossgar.Such is the standard of this musical event that the society plays to full houses every year and there is no doubt that this yearrsquos production will be correspondingly attended.

I liked the balance of having the occasional day at home and the rest of the week in the office.ldquoI think the boys are definitely happy at having mummy home all the time and we all are enjoying that but they miss their school friends.

He also rode many to finish either second or third during the season.The original fixture list for  is now null and void so the original dates for Downpatrick and Down Royal, when we hopefully get back to normal sooner than later, will be all change to those originally sent out to members.An interesting fact that I learned with interest at the weekend was that Willie Robinson, who rode Laffy to win the  Ulster National at Downpatrick for the Queen Mother, was retained by Major John Corbett of Tyrella to ride for him.This was in the s before he moved to England as stable jockey to Fulke Walwyn. O course Laffy was stabled at Major Corbettrsquos establishment prior to running in the Ulster National, being trained in England by Peter Cazalet.With no racing in Ireland or England at the present time, it is a good chance to do some reading and a book just recently published, The Story of Dundalk Stadium, is a must for local racing fans.As most people know Dundalk mdash always thought about as the third local track, despite being in Co Louth mdash holds some great memories for locals, too many to record here.A feature by Frankie Fitzsimons is most interesting and he recalls the day that his father and namesake, brother Brian and himself, all rose in the famous Sweet Afton Hunters Chase back in .Frankie senior finished fth on Royal Knight, now owned by Tom Kerr from Ballygowan, while Brian rode Satin Link, also owned by Kerr, whose colours were red with the initials THK on them. Frankie finished third on Bright Cottage in the colours of Brightrsquos Arnold Ennis, who at that stage was a farmer but later turned his farm into a popular golf club.The book records that Frankie senior won the Sweet Afton in  on Fort Wayne, trained by Major John Corbett at Tyrella. He also rode Copper Cottage, trained beside Downpatrick Racecourse by Ned Altern in . He also won the race in  on Copper Ridge, like Copper Cottage owned by Major T W Hughes, this one also trained by Ned Altern. This race was won in  by Frigid Fox, owned by S J Martin from Ballynahinch and ridden by his son Raymond.In later years this race became known as the Tallanstown Hunters Chase and was won by Bald Joker in the colours of Christine McBratney and ridden by her brother-in-law Colin, now a trainer at Crossgar.Frankie Fitzsimons junior rode a few winners under rules, but the one that he will always recall was when he rode Palo to victory in the opening hurdle race of the day at Dundalk in , the horse being owned by the well known busy draper, Downpatrickrsquos Joe Rea, and trained by Peter McGreevy.Back in  owner trainer Tom McConnell, from Carsonstown, near Saintfield, and Darragh Cross amateur Barney Jones recorded their first ever success when successful with loving star in the bumper race.Barney told me recently that on their way that day they collected a lot of bets to place on the horse and as his mouth got dry when he rode he was sucking a sweet that stuck to the roof of his mouth at the start.In  Farranfad farmer and horse breeder Brian Kennedy pulled off a   shock when he saddled Star of Venosos in his green and white belt colours to win the valuable CarrollHandicap Hurdle under Harry Rodgers, now a trainer.This was Brianrsquos first ever success as a trainer and although he only held a licence for a short time he also saddled his charge to win the Ulster Cesarewitch at   at Downpatrick when,memory serves me correctly, it was ridden by Ards jockey Philip Lowry.Lots of other names like Miss K R Payne, Leslie Crawford, Willie Rooney, Jeremy Maxwell, Sammy Shields, Robin Kidd and Pat McAteer feature in the book that brings back some great memories of a popular course, no longer the same to some of us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

Clearly the vast majority of people heeded the advice they had been given, but there were a number of issues involving young people drinking together, the councillor continued.ldquoThe lsquostay at home messagersquo has got through but there is no room for complacency. We need to keep this up and while I appreciate that it is dficult and frustrating for many to stay at home and only venture outside for essential supplies, there will be light at the end of the tunnel.Cllr Clarke said while everyonersquos focus was on doing everything they could to stay safe, he believed that the pandemic will pass.ldquoWe all have a role to play to ensure that this happens as soon as possible, he said. ldquoPeople are yearning for ato normality, but we all need to play out part to ensure that this happens.Cllr Clarke said the impact of the lockdown was having a major impact on businesses in Newcastle who rely heavily upon tourism and who are suffering as a result of the current restrictions on businesses opening.ldquoBusiness has been devastated and I hope that those who have been forced to close will be provided with all the help and support they deserve moving forward, he continued.Cllr Clarke also praised all frontline NHS workers and Newry, Mourne and Down Council staff for continuing to deliver services in the face of the pandemic.He added: ldquoWe owe these people so much. They have stepped forward to help in their own respective fields and deserve our thanks.ldquoAll NHS staff have been fantastic as have local authority directors, who are working from home, and a number of other frontline staff. Refuse collection workers who have maintained normal service levels throughout the pandemic and are to be congratulated.Police confirmed that province-wide, officers issued  fines to people who did not heed the message to stay at home to prevent the spread of coronavirus over the Easter weekend.

Itrsquos a service he says he and his staff have been proud to offer.He has pupils whose parents are key NHS medics, including a couple who are both respiratory consultants, and knows the need to provide a place of shelter and safety for children of key workers is critical.ldquoEvenI had to keep the school open for one child of an NHS worker, it would be worth it, he said. ldquoMy head has said lsquoshut the schoolrsquo like the rest of them, but my heart says we are in this together and wersquove got to do our part.ldquoHowever, Irsquom not condemning any school who has closed as they have probably done so for the best of reasons.ldquoI sat in tears on Sunday evening as I didnrsquot know what I was doing was right in keeping the school open or not. We are one of the few schools offering cover for the weekends and all over Easter. Not one of my staff refused to come in to take a turn to keep the school open.ldquoIrsquove had  or more people offering to come in and help. Irsquove a great staff and they all pull together. At the end of the day, we have done our very best to safeguard the children and staff.Thankfully, Mr Moore has not received any reports of coronavirus amongst his pupils and staff, and he hopes that this status will continue.Known for not taking himself too seriously, Mr Moore has been entertaining and educating his pupils with hilarious Facebook videos of himself as educator turned entertainer. Using his considerable wit and cuddly toys as pretend schoolchildren, the principal of  years has taught mathematics, the importance of punctuation and much more over the last few weeks.He describes the incoming principal, Mr Fegan, as ldquoalmost like a son to me, and is equally proud of his other two former vice-principals, Mr Niall Stevenson and Mrs Lorna Stitt , who left the school to become principals of Downpatrick Primary School and Portavogie Primary School respectively.Mr Moore taught in primary schools in Belfast and Lisburn after he qualying in . He came to Academy as vice-principal in September  and taught a composite P-P class.He took over as principal from Mr George Smyth just five years later. The school at that time only had  children mdash it now has  children registered with double classes in all year groups and the nursery.ldquoI was appointed acting principal and Irsquove been acting principal ever since, quips Mr Moore.ldquoThe highlights for me have been many. Itrsquos been a honour not only to see children develop and flourish, but also my staff. Irsquom delighted with how my vice principals have gone on in their careers and that Mr Fegan has now been confirmed as the incoming principal after first coming here as a student teacher.ldquoIrsquove taken as much pleasure at seeing how some of my former pupils have fared in their careers and le as much as our AQE results, which are excellent. The school has also had three outstanding inspection reports in my time and apart from perhaps three rooms, the school has been completely refurbished.ldquoThe children are great ambassadors and a lot of them go on to to Down High School or Saintfield High School or Belfast grammar schools and quite often end up as head boy or head girl.His official send-off mdash a special assembly with an eveningat Temple Golf Club on June  mdash has been postponed.ldquoPersonally, itrsquos not ideal but there are people losing their lives, incomes, jobs, business are crashing, doctors and nurses putting their lives on the line, I will come back at a later stage and there will be a chance for everyone to say goodbye,said Mr Moore.ldquoTo be honest, Irsquom more upset for the Ps as most of them have been with us for eight years. Wersquove had to cancel going to Edinburgh, their leaving show which was going to be The Lion King in my honour.He said that his greatest delight at the school has been his pupils.ldquoThey are the main reason for my y tenure. It has been a joy to be their principal, he added.ldquoIt has also been an honour to have worked alongside the board of governors, both past and present, who have shared my vision for the school and supported me in its realisation.ldquoI am indebted in particular to the late Rev Alan Delamere, Mr David Donnan, Mr Geoffrey Perrin and currently Mr Peter Shaw for their leadership at the helm.ldquoThe current members of our teaching and non-teaching staff continue to reflect the professional dedication and loving care of their predecessors. I have been truly blessed to have a staff who have had a collective desire to put children first.Mr Moore also paid tribute to the parents and s for their ldquodaily partnership with the staff and your personal support to me as principal for over two decades.He and his we, Lynne, who live in Saintfield, share five children together and he says retirement will bring him a chance for them both to travel ndash when the travel ban is lted ndash and for him to devote more time to his beloved sports mdash hersquos a major football and rugby fan.He has been approached to do some educational consultancy work when he is officially retired but is happy to limit that to just several days a week.Mr Moore added: ldquoI can honestly say that during my time at Academy I have never wished that I had been a school leader anywhere  or that I was employed in an alternative profession.ldquoI will definitely shed a tear or two when I go. They will get over me, of course, as nobody is irreplaceable, but I will certainly miss the children and staff. I will not miss the responsibility of the day to day running of the place, but Irsquom a social animal and I will really miss everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Legacy.jpg","title":"The legacy of John de Courcy  ","story":"THE story starts in  when the Norman soldier-adventurer, Sir John de Courcy, went north from Dublin, the headquarters of Norman power in Ireland, and arrived at Downpatrick on February .De Courcy was a man of great physical strength and size. He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor. Chambers and passages were constructed along with a staircase rising to the walk wall.For over two centuries from  the history of the castle is barely documented. It appears that the Magennises seized Dundrum sometime in the th century and held it intermittently until it was surrendered to the Crown by Phelim Magennis in . The Savages appear to have been the owners when the Earl of Kildare took it in .The castle was granted to Lord Cromwell in , then sold in  by his grandson, the first earl of Ardglass, to Sir Francis Blundell.During the rising of  the Magennises retrieved the castle, but it was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, who partly demolished it in . By  the castle and grounds were placed into state care.Perhaps more than anywhere  in Ireland, Dundrum reflects the Anglo-Irish spirit ndash the work of the great de Courcy, the soldier-knight adventurer. Today Dundrum Castle is a ruin. De Courcyrsquos other achievement in Ulster, Carrickfergus Castle, is the best preserved Norman castle in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 When.jpg","title":"When Stirling Moss came to Downpatrick  ","story":"A RETIRED Downpatrick motor dealer has expressed his ldquotremendous sadness at the death of Sir Stirling Moss at the weekend.The motor racing legend, who was , was the guest of honour at the opening of Mr Billy McCormickrsquos refurbished Black and White garage in .It was a major event in the town and there were hundreds of people outside the newly renovated premises in Church Street, all eager to get a glimpse of one of the worldrsquos top sports stars.Mr McCormick has fond memories of the occasion. ldquoIt was a big day in every sense.

Please try again later.Submitting...That group’s proposals were suddenly published late on Friday night – a classic slot in which to ‘bury bad news’.However, it has now emerged that in the Department for the Economy’s haste to publish the list just before pm on Friday, it made an error.A source engaged in the process told the News Letter that the list which had been made public was “the wrong document” and contained several mistakes.The department also failed to publish an accompanying document which the advisory group had drawn up.That document, a ‘narrative’ which explained the process and also set out how other businesses which believed they had wrongly been excluded from the list could ask to be included, was not made public by Diane Dodds’ department.Another source, from industry, said that the list which had been published had involved a classic political fudge: “Michelle will be very comfortable with the list. But Arlene will be very happywith the fact that it is only advisory, so has no legal force.”A third source said that what was published was “very, very close” to the actual document, but it was “not what was agreed” and contained “a few omissions”.Three weeks ago Ms O’Neill had said she would use “every legal power” to shut non-essential businesses.However, that position appears to have implicitly receded with the publication of the list as advice and with no legal weight which would allow Stormont to shut workplaces which ignore it.The News Letter asked DfE whether it would make clear what omissions had been made from the document.The department said: “While the Priority List is intended to be a fluid document to reflect the changing nature of this crisis, there were some omissions from it due to a clerical error. These omissions are now being rectied.”The department confirmed tonight that the correct list has tonight been published and is available at this link: https:www.nibusinessinfo sites default files Priority-Sectors-List-V.pdfBreweries, explosives and oven shops in essential categoryThe list of essential businesses includes everything from oven shops to car mechanics and breweries – although because it is only advice, any business is free to ignore the advice and open anyway.The list also includes the wholesale trade in live animals, agricultural retailers, officer suppliers, refrigeration sales and repairs, newspapers, scientic research and development, private health services and explosives suppliers, along with scores of other categories.The list was drawn up by the engagement forum established by Economy Minister Diane Dodds to advise on which businesses should be classed as essential and how workplaces could be made safer.The forum is chaired by the Labour Relations Agency and includes representatives from business organisations, trade unions, councils, Stormont, the Health and Safety Executive, Public Health Agency and Food Standards Agency.In a late-night statement on Friday, Mrs Dodds said that she had presented the list of “priority businesses” to the Executive that day and it had agreed to publish it along with a document giving guidance on safe working practices during the pandemic.Mrs Dodds said that those on the group had been “united in their determination to work together towards a common goal”.She added: “The list is published for advisory purposes to allow companies to make their own decisions. If a company can work within the social distancing guidelines then it should do so.”She said that the list was “fully supported by both business and union representatives on the forum”.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Every council needs to cut out waste and prioritise key services without resorting to punishing tax hikes on their residents.”The Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, John O’Connell said: “The coronavirus crisis means that frontline council services are more crucial than ever, but at the same time household budgets face an enormous squeeze.“There are plenty of talented people in local authorities who are focused on delivering more for less, but that is needed across the board.“The country needs every council to cut out waste and prioritise key services without resorting to punishing tax hikes on their residents.“These figures should shine a light on the town hall bosses who’ve got it right, but also allow taxpayers to hold to account those who aren’t delivering value for money at this critical time.”The TaxPayers’ Alliance’s Town Hall Rich List  can be found athttps:www.taxpayersalliance town_hall_rich_list_A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

And Connor is worried this might be the case in the north.“If it’s not safe for crowds, how can it be safe for players ” he questioned. “Unless players are consistently checked once a week, but then all you need is one player to get the virus within that period of time and suddenly he’ll spread it and the league will probably have to be shut down completely.Institute manager Sean Connor. : jpimedia“I was quite confident about the season finishing, but I was listening to Newstalk on Sunday and the GAA are saying that there will be no big crowds here and no football until there’s a vaccine, which makes it very worrying, because you could be talking  months or longer for that to happen.“Look, I don’t know what to do but you can’t just stop football for  months - that would be unthinkable.”Connor also strongly feels that tough decisions will need to be made in terms of when to completely call off the   season.“If we can’t get back playing by the start of August, then I think some football clubs will go to the wall,” he explained. “I just fear what would happenwe don’t start the new campaign.NIFL , have to be looking towards making a decision about starting the new campaign and almost writing this season off.“As I said,this season isn’t starting by August, then decisions have to be made because when are you going to start the new season  I thinkwe get things going by the end of August, you would have to start fresh and it would give everybody time for a pre-season. Yes it would be unfortunate that this season would be wiped out, but that’s the way you would have to do it.“If you end up playing this season out into August then when do you start the new season  There’s lots of ramications. It’s a very dficult decision for anybody to make but maybe the sensible thing would be, which I know suits us, to finish the season as is with no relegation and we promote the top two teams in the Championship andgo with a  team Premiership for one season.“It’s easy to say that we’ll have a summer league in the   season, but when do you come back to your normal season or do you never come back. To me that’s a step that just throws everything out of sink. That’s why I think it’s much easier to stop as we are, top two of the Championship are promoted and we have a  team Premiership, give it a go for a season.“Maybe that’s the way forward, maybe we need  teams in the Premiership, to get away from playing each other four times a year and maybe it will put some freshness into the league. If we had  teams in the Premiership and we play each other three teams, that’s  games and just one extra game that we are playing at the moment.”The former Dundalk manager has been using ious social media apps like Zoom, Whatsapp and arranging Conference calls as he stays in regular contact with chairman Bill Anderson, his coaching staff and players, during the COVID- pandemic and he wants to wish ’Stute supporters well.“I speak to the chairman every two days, I have Zoom video conferences with the coaching staff and we have a Whatsapp group chat for the players, where we send the players their training programmes and they reply with their results from the sessions, so we are keeping busy that way.“Yes, using social media isn’t ideal but it’s not bad and it’s giving some of our players who have wee niggles, the chance to get rid of their niggles while other players are getting some really good fitness work done. The only thing you are missing is obviously the group work and the tactical work and that’s a big miss.“But hopefully we can get over this current situation and I can’t wait to see everyone soon, back at the Brandywell and I hope the Institute fans are staying safe and staying active.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
