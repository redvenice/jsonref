Turkey threatens us.

Some of the show was great – notably, Olivia Colman’s gloriously ebullient Best Actress speech, Rami Malek’s equally endearing response to winning Best Actor          I loved Spike Lee behaving in the same lunatic way he does at New York Knicks gamesBut what it didn’t do was make me laugh.Instead, it dripped with insufferable identity politics, Trump-bashing, and a series of box ticking awards that smacked of Hollywood trying to make itself look as worthy and virtuous as possible.‘I can’t believe a film about menstruation won an Oscar’ wept director Rayka Zehtabchi for her (powerful) film Period. End of Sentence.Really?I’d have been more shocked if it hadn’t.After all, the main winners last night were a film about a gay immigrant rock star, a film about a black superhero with an almost entirely black cast, a film about racial injustice in segregated U.S. South in the 1960s, a film about a black detective who goes undercover with the Ku Klux Klan – and Roma, a beautifully made but almost unwatchably dull, depressing and painfully slow black-and-white film about a Mexican maid, in Spanish with subtitles.I’m not disputing the inidual merits of any of the winners, but it’s hard not to avoid the conclusion that Hollywood – whose Academy voters are predominantly old white guys – is now doing everything in its power to avoid more of the‘White Oscars’ backlashes of recent years.Even the red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s magnificent!’ screamed Twitter.          The red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s ridiculous!’ I screamed back.In the end, the only real amusement came from watching people I’d never heard of, and frankly was quite happy never to have heard of, making fools of themselves on stage during the seemingly endless tedious production categories.The hapless trio from Vice who won the make-up and hair award made collectively the worst speech in Oscars history - a bumbling, stumbling, jabbering, linguistic fiasco that became the perfect evidential argument for sliding these kind of awards into commercial breaks, as was intended this year until a massive furore from ‘the industry’ forced the producers to do a U-turn.But at least they were riveting, for all the wrong reasons.When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting the names of what seemed like every single human being he’d ever met.I counted at least 40 people on his turgid list of mainly nonentities.          When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting names Important to him, I’m sure – but utterly irrelevant to the billion people watching around the world.Oh for a trap door that could have sucked him down into the bowels of the Kodak Theatre and spared us this orgy of self-indulgence.And what about the ridiculous woman who made Free Solo, the extraordinary documentary about climber Alex Honnold? She barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her on stage!          Documentary maker Chai Vasarhelyi (in gray) barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her! ( second from right)But for me, the single most depressing moment came with presenting duo Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic.‘I want these people to like me to a degree that is embarrassing,’ gushed Mulaney, and you could see he really meant it.‘Wait, why are we still here?’ exclaimed Awkwafina, as they remained on stage to introduce a second award.  The single most depressing moment came with  Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic. Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?I asked myself the exact same question, with this supplementary: Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?Yet today, I’ve read many people raving about them and saying they were so ‘hilarious’ they should host the whole show next year.To which I say: Hayi!

Securing the necessary changes to the backstop is not the only thing the Government is doing to build support for the deal across the House of CommonsAnd to protect workers’ rights, a concern for many MPs as we leave the EU, we will give Parliament a vote on whether it wishes to follow suit whenever the EU changes its standards. The UK leads the way on workers’ rights, environmental protections and health and safety – as we leave the EU, we will continue to enhance them.I firmly believe that a deal is within our grasp.Yesterday I committed in Parliament to give MPs a second meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement by March 12 at the latest. I am confident that we can win that vote. But because many MPs are worried that if we lose that vote Parliament would not have time to make its voice heard on the next steps, I gave two other assurances.If the Government has not won a meaningful vote by March 12, we will ask MPs if they support leaving the EU on March 29 without a Withdrawal Agreement.If the House rejects leaving on March 29 without a deal, the Government will bring forward a motion on whether Parliament wants to seek a short limited extension to Article 50.And if the House votes for an extension, we will seek to agree one with the EU and bring forward the necessary legislation.But I do not want to see Article 50 extended.Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on March 29.

His cynical political games would take us back to square one.Instead, Parliament should do its duty so that our country can move forward.We want to leave the EU with a deal that gives us the best of both worlds: a close relationship with our nearest neighbours and the chance to make the most of our talents and resources by building new relationships with growing economies around the world."},{"url":null,"title":"Dont waste foreign aid budget international agency staff says Penny Mordaunt","story":"    International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt (pictured leaving Downing Street today) has drawn up plans for the UK to take more control of how we help countries around the worldMiss Mordaunt believes that by spending a larger share of the money on programmes UK officials have picked they will have better control of how it is used – making sure it is focused on this country\u0027s priorities. The shake-up will also allow Britain to take credit for its generosity by putting the UK Aid logo on items it has paid for, such as food packages.International agencies that want to maintain funding will need to do more to demonstrate they are providing good value for money, with the extension of a \u0027payment by results\u0027 system.\u0027Leadsom went off like a firework\u0027: Inside the seething...\u0027I\u0027d rather go on holiday\u0027: Nigel Farage says he would...Share this articleThe Department for International Development has criticised its multilateral partners for \u0027too much inefficiency, especially in back-office functions\u0027.It warned in a 2016 review: \u0027We are clear that organisations tasked with assisting some of the world\u0027s most vulnerable people must bear down on their own costs.\u0027This includes stricter control of daily allowances and travel expenses but also the pay levels of senior staff and boards.\u0027 It singled out Unesco – the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation – the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Caribbean Development Bank for criticism, while health-focused organisations including the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance drew praise.

Who could blame her for looking for a way out? The right playbook however is Churchill\u0027s. Keep buggering on,\u0027 writes David Davis. Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street to address Parliament on TuesdayAs we enter the end game in negotiations with the EU, it would be folly of the highest magnitude to take No Deal off the table now because it takes away our leverage in negotiations and is against our national interest.Let\u0027s be honest. Many of those who want to take No Deal off the table are not seeking to ensure the UK obtains the optimum Brexit deal. Their real agenda is to block Brexit or secure one which is little more than a Brexit in name only.Various Commons amendments drawn up by Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper in discussion with some Conservative Remainers, which would veto a No-Deal outcome, were wrecking amendments that would leave a poisonous constitutional legacy and break the solemn commitments made in the Conservatives\u0027 2017 election manifesto. Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s support only reinforces my view of this.It is time instead to focus on what actually unites our Government, our party and our country. Record numbers of Britons who voted for Brexit want it delivered on time. Above all we all want an orderly exit from the European Union.            The Haltemprice and Howden writes: \u0027Mrs May\u0027s announcement yesterday in which she conceded two Commons votes on Brexit in mid March is the wrong move. It sends the wrong message to the EU. Opening up the possibility of ruling out No Deal, or extending Article 50, may harm our negotiating position.\u0027 Mr Davis is pictured at the launch of a proposed UK-EU free trade agreement in London on February 6The public has always been ahead of and more relaxed on No Deal than politicians. They are right to be. An anonymous civil servant recently said there are \u0027hundreds of No-Deal plans across all government departments just waiting for the green light from ministers to be made public\u0027. I know this to be true. Most of it I initiated in my first days as Brexit Secretary. It will be a sad day indeed if British politicians show such contempt for the public, and I fear the electoral consequences for my own party.For MPs now to try to blackmail the Government into surrendering its negotiating position, rip up constitutional conventions and seize control of the executive in order to obstruct Brexit, is an abuse of the parliamentary process and an affront to democracy.If MPs use the enormous powers they enjoy to thwart the expressed will of the people, that is a constitutional travesty. Such a blatant dismissal of the wishes of the public is contempt for democracy and for millions of Britons.Conservatism is based on pragmatism and realism. Which is precisely why we should now hold our nerve and see these negotiations through. The passing of the Commons amendment by Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady last month with its legally binding changes to the Northern Ireland backstop showed the way forward for the Prime Minister. It showed that there is a majority in Parliament for an improved EU withdrawal agreement and orderly Brexit.What on earth will be the consequences for our party if we don\u0027t do this? Only this weekend the Conservatives\u0027 national convention voted overwhelmingly in favour of leaving No Deal on the table and no delay to Brexit. It said scuppering the UK\u0027s departure from the EU would \u0027damage democracy and our party for a generation\u0027.We must unify the party around the Brexit the British people clearly voted for and offer them the optimistic future they deserve. It is also in our national interest.The Prime Minister should ignore those ministers currently having a panic attack about the prospects of No Deal. Their fears are certainly exaggerated. More critically, while No Deal might – might – be economically difficult, No Brexit would be a democratic disaster.Ignore the saboteurs, the wreckers, and the blackmailers. Don\u0027t concede ground. Free our minds of doubt and danger. We can achieve it. Hold our nerve and deliver what we promised."},{"url":null,"title":"Decathalon stores scrap plans sell hijab France runners France","story":"    A model sports the Decathlon head covering, meant for runners and athletesThe controversy is the latest in France over face- and body-covering garments worn by Muslim women. The hijab covers the hair but leaves the face open.While opponents of the attire say it subjugates women, its defenders argue that items like the sports hijab allow Muslim women to take an active role in society.Iranian Instagram influencers begin wearing hijab and delete...Models in headscarves and Islamic robes take to the catwalk...Austria\u0027s burqa ban comes into force this weekend, but also...German judge tells Syrian woman she must remove her Islamic...Share this articleIn 2004, France, home to Europe\u0027s largest Muslim population, banished the hijab from the classroom and government offices.

Mr Thissen had to hike through bushes to avoid police patrols before he could enter the games hall    Untouched: The site looks as though it has been undisturbed since the nuclear disaster in 2011 apart from the odd looted vending or cash machineApart from looted vending and cash machines, the spot still had stacks of tokens, winnable cuddly toys and games galore - all surfaces covered in a thin layer of radioactive dust.Mr Thissen believes the site appears to have remained untouched since the Fukushima nuclear disaster - which saw more than 160,000 people flee, leaving homes, belongings and their old lives behind.He said: \u0027The noise inside a SEGA hall is overwhelming, different loud sounds come from each arcade and they also contain a lot of visuals and flashing lights to attract people. Players are totally absorbed in the games.\u0027So it was strange to find a normally vibrant place totally silent and sombre, no lights, visuals or sound.\u0027While I was walking around, I suddenly heard stuffed animals say I love you.\u0027          Some of the winnable toys and games had batteries which were still in working order and Mr Thissen even heard stuffed animals saying \u0027I love you\u0027           Mr Thissen believes that without the radioactive dust covering the entire place, looters would have stolen the arcade games themselves and sold them on for more money. Pictured is a SEGA games hall that, by comparison, has not closed down          A thin layer of radioactive dust covers all of the old games and has served to deter any potential looters from disturbing the pristine site\u0027It was crazy to see the batteries still worked.

But because of the nuclear disaster everything is left behind.\u0027People fled during the Fukushima disaster and it appears to be in almost the exact same state as it was left.          The earthquake triggered a subsequent tsunami which destabilised a nearby nuclear power plant that would change the future of Fukushima forever           Following the disaster the government put up exclusion zones to try and minimise radiation contamination as much as possible \u0027Soon the whole area will be history. The clean-up and rehabilitation happens really quick and former red zones are coming back to life.\u0027That\u0027s why I think it\u0027s important to show the real aftermath of the disaster before all traces are gone.\u0027A magnitude nine earthquake - the strongest ever experienced in Japan - hit the region in March 2011, and a subsequent tsunami destabilised the nuclear power plant that would forever change Fukushima.The spot has remained near-lifeless and hidden from the outside world behind government exclusion zones - put in place for fear of radiation contamination.Some of the games included Sonic the Hedgehog, Donkey Kong, House of the Dead, and many more, including toys of Disney characters, talking bears and more.Mr Thissen who visited the site for his YouTube channel, Exploring the Unbeaten Path, wasn\u0027t surprised by the extremely-pristine condition of the games hall.          Some of the games included in the abandoned site are Sonic the Hedgehog, Donkey Kong and House of the Dead (pictured)          Mr Thissen believes that part of the reason the site is so untouched is because people living in Japan respect the boundaries put in place by authority Having visited multiple spots within Fukushima, he believes the people of Japan respect the boundaries put in place, which has helped to preserve it as a near eight-year-old time piece.Mr Thissen said said: \u0027I wasn\u0027t surprised, because almost everything is left untouched in the forbidden zone.\u0027Everywhere else in the world these buildings would be totally looted after a few weeks.\u0027The Japanese people really respect the rules and never trespass, even if doors are wide open.He initially spotted the locations during his trip in 2017, but was unable to reach it.Now having gone back to document the dying remains of Fukushima, he hopes others will respect and appreciate the hall too.Mr Thissen added: \u0027We drove by this location in 2017 on route six - at that time the only open road which goes through the red zone - and I really wanted to see it.\u0027But because there was a lot of activity in the red zone - demolition, renovation, radioactive clean-up - we didn\u0027t manage to get there.\u0027We went back to document more of the forbidden zone of Fukushima, like this SEGA hall.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"EU negotiator Barnier insists trying deal Brexit","story":"    Emmanuel Macron\u0027s intervention, at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured), comes amid mounting pressure for a long delay of up to two years          Michel Barnier insisted he was doing \u0027all I can\u0027 to get a Brexit deal today with just 30 days until Britain is due to leave the EU          But the EU negotiator insisted again he would not re-write the Irish border backstop -despite Theresa May saying it is the only way to get MPs to agree the deal            Standing alongside Mrs Merkel, Mr Macron said: We would support an extension request only if it was justified by a new choice of the British.But we would in no way accept an extension without a clear objective,He added: \u0027As Michel Barnier has said, we don\u0027t need more time, what we need most of all is a decision.\u0027  This morning Mr Barnier said again he would not re-write the Irish border backstop -despite Theresa May saying it is the only way to get MPs to agree the deal.Mr Barnier played down the prospect of a short extension to the Brexit talks making any difference to the outcome.He said the UK had to make a \u0027firm decision\u0027 on what it wanted as it left the bloc, echoing the EU\u0027s message since Mrs May\u0027s deal was crushed by 230 votes in January.Mr Barnier told France Info Radio today \u0027I am doing all I can\u0027 but added that the border backstop \u0027cannot be renegotiated\u0027. Are Tory Brexiteers ready to BACK May\u0027s Brexit deal?

It’ll even find the best route to schoolForm-filling, missed voicemails, endless phone calls – recruiting temporary teachers at very short notice can be a cumbersome process for both candidates and the school. Admin like this takes up valuable time that could be much better spent doing what matters most: being in the classroom. At a time when both schools and teachers are under increasing pressure to get it right first time, temporary recruitment is an area that’s ripe for reinvention – and tech such as the Affinity Hub app is leading the way.“At 7am, our recruitment offices would be flooded with calls from schools, all trying to get staff for that day because teachers had called in sick or were unavailable,” says Marie Kirwin, project manager for the Affinity Hub. “Teachers would come out of school and find a barrage of voicemail messages offering them jobs for tomorrow. We wanted to create a system that would give our candidates and our clients control of their own recruitment.”With all the necessary admin online, candidates save time using the Affinity Hub well before they step into a school. Before their agency interview, they can upload their vital documentation via the hub, meaning no piles of paper getting lost in the post. If something is missing, out of date or incorrect, the agency can let the candidate know before they come in, so they don’t have to make another trip.Once they’re registered, candidates can change their availability status and accept or reject roles with a touch of the screen. Previously, they would have to ring their consultant every week with their availability – which could change very quickly. There are no fiddly timesheets to fill in and get signed: they simply touch in their phones when they arrive at the school to record the exact times of their arrival and departure. All these timesheets and pay slips can be viewed at any time, and the candidate is automatically joined to the company’s employee loyalty scheme, allowing them to accrue points to get benefits.When the next role comes up, there’s no need for candidates to ring or text with their availability – they simply select the opportunities that best suit them. And the app will even find the best route to the candidate’s school automatically, using Google Maps.Better tech suits schools as well: they can manage their entire process themselves in a very short time. Creating a job on the app takes just a few moments before it’s pushed out to candidates. A talent pool facility allows them to send that opportunity out to a selected group of candidates who have done well working at the school previously.The entire process can be done via the hub. “It’s much quicker and sleeker – and it means only one set of login details, too, which is a big bonus in this day and age,” says Esme Bianchi-Barry, MD of Monarch Education, an education recruitment business brand within Affinity Workforce, which has been trialling the hub with its candidates.The app also suits the schools of today. Many multi-academy trusts manage their recruitment over several schools via a single office. The hub allows them to see exactly where the needs are across these schools in real-time, meaning that any gaps can be filled quickly and easily. Having all this information on a single system also gives them the data to plan ahead. “They can draw out certain trends,” explains Bianchi-Barry. “For instance, is their cover booked first thing in the morning? Or is it mainly pre-booked? What kind of teachers do they need most commonly? Analysing these trends means that they can improve their forward planning, and budget more efficiently. It’s hard to gather this data when you’ve got five or six different schools using five or six systems across 15 suppliers.”Having the day-to-day recruitment taken care of also means that schools and recruitment consultants have time to focus on the bigger picture together. “Consultants are able to focus on the more complicated roles, or the newer schools that might not have people in, or new roles,” says Kirwin.Of course, no app or piece of tech can be a substitute for person-to-person interaction. “We are very clear that we don’t want to take away the human element of the candidate and consultant relationship,” says Bianchi-Barry. “So much good stuff comes from that. It helps us place the right candidates, and do right by both candidate and client. But the app makes the admin so much easier.”Making the recruitment process better is a win for everyone, says Kirwin. “For schools, it’s a vital time-saver. And it could even help attract more teachers into this area at a time when teacher recruitment numbers are down. We can show newly qualified teachers, for example, how the hub makes it is easier to work in this kind of environment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a8aefd54f7fd85e11ddabde63cd7ee11f1d5320/0_70_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b9ac855d296ecb24e02652568bef4ad","title":"the uninhabitable earth review david wallace wells","story":"Enough to induce a panic attack ... a brutal portrait of climate change and our future lives on Earth. But we have the tools to avoid itYou already know it’s bad. You already know the weather has gone weird, the ice caps are melting, the insects are disappearing from the Earth. You already know that your children, and your children’s children, if they are reckless or brave enough to reproduce, face a vista of rising seas, vanishing coastal cities, storms, wildfires, biblical floods. As someone who reads the news and is sensitive to the general mood of the times, you have a general sense of what we’re looking at. But do you truly understand the scale of the tribulations we face? David Wallace-Wells, author of the distressingly titled The Uninhabitable Earth, is here to tell you that you do not. “It is,” as he puts it in the book’s first line, “worse, much worse, than you think.”The book expands on a viral article, also titled The Uninhabitable Earth, which Wallace-Wells published in New York in the summer of 2017, and which frightened the life out of everyone who read it. Writing at length, he is even more remorseless in his delineation of what the not nearly distant enough future probably holds for us. The book’s longest section, entitled Elements of Chaos, is composed of 12 short and brutal chapters, each of which foretells a specific dimension of our forecast doom, and whose titles alone – Heat Death Dying Oceans Unbreathable Air Plagues of Warming – are enough to induce an honest-to-God panic attack.Wallace-Wells identifies a tendency, even among those of us who think we are already sufficiently terrified of the future, to be strangely complacent about the figures. Yes, we know that climate change will cause sea level rises of between four to eight feet before the end of this century, but then again what’s a few feet if you happen to live a couple of miles inland? “That so many feel already acclimated to the prospect of a near-future world with dramatically higher oceans,” he writes, “should be as dispiriting and disconcerting as if we’d already come to accept the inevitability of extended nuclear war – because that is the scale of devastation the rising oceans will bring.”This all makes for relentlessly grim reading, particularly in that first section. As is generally the case in any sustained exposure to the subject of climate change – a subject that can seem increasingly like the only subject – a kind of apocalyptic glaze descends over even the most conscientious eyes, a peculiarly contemporary compound of boredom and horror. (“Human kind,” as the bird in TS Eliot’s Four Quartets sagely points out, “cannot bear very much reality.”) It’s a problem of which Wallace-Wells is clearly aware. “If you have made it this far, you are a brave reader,” as he puts it, somewhere past the halfway point, acknowledging the likelihood of the material he’s sifting through causing despondency in anyone considering it. “But you are not merely considering it,” he clarifies, “you are about to embark on living it. In many cases, in many places, we already are.”That last point turns out to be one of the most crucial of the book’s warnings. Because as dire as the projections are, if you are surveying the topic from a privileged western vantage, it’s easy to overlook how bad things have already got, to accept the hurricanes and the heatstroke deaths as simply the unfortunate nature of things. In this way, Wallace-Wells raises the disquieting spectre of future normalisation – the prospect that we might raise, incrementally but inexorably, our baseline of acceptable human suffering. (This phenomenon is not without precedent. See, for example, the whole of human history.)For a relatively short book, The Uninhabitable Earth covers a great deal of cursed ground – drought, floods, wildfires, economic crises, political instability, the collapse of the myth of progress – and reading it can feel like taking a hop-on hop-off tour of the future’s sprawling hellscape. It’s not without its hopeful notes: in a sense, none of this would even be worth talking about if there were nothing we could do about it. As Wallace-Wells points out, we already have all the tools we need to avoid the worst of what is to come: “a carbon tax and the political apparatus to aggressively phase out dirty energy a new approach to agricultural practices and a shift away from beef and dairy in the global diet and public investment in green energy and carbon capture”. The fact that the route out of this hell is straightforward does not mean, of course, that it won’t be incredibly arduous, or that we should be confident of making it.The book, however, is less focused on solutions than on clarifying the scale of the problem, the horror of its effects. You could call it alarmist, and you would not be wrong. (In the closing pages, Wallace-Wells himself accepts the charge as “fair enough, because I am alarmed”.) But to read The Uninhabitable Earth – or to consider in any serious way the scale of the crisis we face – is to understand the collapse of the distinction between alarmism and plain realism.

It’s a shame that looms large in the history of the Chagos Islands, an archipelago whose tiny size is in perfect contrast to the scale of the wrongs its people have witnessed. They are wrongs stretching back centuries, since the British formally acquired the islands from France – as part of the bigger colony of Mauritius – and forced slaves from Mozambique and Madagascar to work on British-owned coconut plantations.That original sin was compounded when, granting independence to Mauritius in the 1960s, Britain used a combination of bullying and blackmail to hive off the Chagos Islands so that they could remain colonised, leaving Britain free to do with the islands as it wanted. What Britain wanted, it turned out, was to forcibly remove the local population – sometimes referred to in official documents as “Man Fridays” – leaving the territory available for cold war-era US defence facilities. The papers documenting this sorry process were – along with those that report other state-sanctioned colonial crimes such as the murder and torture of Mau Mau insurgents in Kenya – sent to Britain and “disappeared” by the Foreign Office, to avoid scrutiny or accountability.Now that these documents have come to light – many because of legal action brought by Mau Mau survivors – Britain has continued to oppose justice for the Chagossians. The UK’s lawyers, led by solicitor general Robert Buckland, did concede that Chagossians were treated “very badly” during their removal from their home. But the islanders speak better for themselves. Liseby Elysé recounted how Britain stopped the shipment of food and medicine from Mauritius on which they relied, until they had little choice but to board a ship for Mauritius, leaving almost everything behind. Elysé was pregnant at the time, and when she arrived four days later, she lost her baby. “Conditions in the hull of the ship were bad,” she told the international court of justice (ICJ). “We were like animals and slaves in that ship.”But the Chagossians’ plight did not end there. Those who ended up in the UK more recently fell to the mercy of the “hostile environment” immigration policy in the same way as the Windrush generation. Some of the Chagossians’ descendants now have deportation to worry about in addition to their other woes. Worse still, this deportation would not be to their home islands, obviously, because Britain still prohibits that.In the meantime, the Chagos island of Diego Garcia, which became a US military base, has become a well-known case. Britain let the Americans use it for extraordinary rendition, as a hub for flights transporting terror suspects to be interrogated “off grid”, illegally tortured by the CIA, and then transferred to the now notorious detention facility at Guantánamo Bay. Between slavery, colonialism, ongoing human rights violations, the war in Iraq, the removal of documents and even the Windrush scandal, it’s hard to think of a single better example than the Chagos Islands of everything that is wrong with the legacy that the country we currently inhabit has created. Now the ICJ has said the UK must make amends. Remarkably, given that most of the former British empire was dismantled more than 50 years ago – including Mauritius, granted independence in 1968 – the world’s court has ruled Britain must finish what it started. The decolonisation of Mauritius will only be complete, the Hague-based judges said, when the Chagos Islands are returned to Mauritian rule.Britain the colonial power – as we were called during the unedifying process of attempting to defend this state of affairs in the world court – is not quite the image its leaders are trying to project just now. The irony of that was not lost on Philippe Sands – the British professor of international law representing Mauritius – who couldn’t resist quoting Boris Johnson. “No country wishes to be a colony,” Sands said in his closing remarks, before citing the former foreign secretary’s stance on Brexit. “The UK does not wish to be a colony, yet it stands before this court to defend a status as coloniser of others.”All this was watched by no fewer than 31 nations, including key European players – such as France, the Netherlands and Germany – key Commonwealth partners and former colonies, including India and members of the African Union. Not one was willing to defend the UK’s substantive position except the United States, which has an obvious vested interest in the continued operation of the military base .This decision, and what happens next, will be pored over by international lawyers for years to come. The Chagossians, who are now celebrating the unlikeliest of victories against the nation that changed the course of their lives, say they are going home. But for the rest of us, it’s a legal arrow that strikes at the heart of our delusions of grandeur. Britain is the nation that wants to be seen as an oppressed EU “colony”, while nostalgic for the status that came from dominating, oppressing and abusing others. Quite fitting then, that this week of all weeks, the empire should strike back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63a84768362c58369715e3aec2dbcfbf85c275bb/0_165_5391_3235/master/5391.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4831daaacb2d95a6bbf20c31b4fae76c","title":"tory plans no deal brexit medical shortages","story":"“A no-deal Brexit … is expected to have an immediate and drastic effect on supply chains” for medicines. From the pen of an op-ed writer, such language might seem alarmist. But this comes from a report published this week in the Lancet, a world-class scientific journal – and it should terrify you.But what we don’t know is which medicines will be affected. The secretary of state for health, Matt Hancock, knows. The Commons health and social care select committee asked him to publish a list of the medicines and medical products for which his department had supply concerns. But despite the public interest, he refused, citing “commercial confidentiality”. And he’s muzzled suppliers with non-disclosure agreements so they can’t tell us either.The government has sought to reassure patients that its contingency plans are robust, but the Lancet report says “stockpiling arrangements cannot cope for more than a few weeks”. The Lancet also notes that some affected products, such as radioisotopes needed for treating some types of cancer, simply cannot be stockpiled.How the government plans to deal with shortages was the subject of a brief, private consultation last year. What it suggested was a “serious shortage protocol” dealing with “in particular … a scenario with multiple large shortages”. Those are words that should alarm you – which may well be why the government has not used them in any of its public documents.Subsequently, it has legislated for serious shortage protocols. The government, if or when shortages arise, will now permit pharmacists to substitute a different “strength, quantity or pharmaceutical form of a prescription-only medicine, or a different prescription-only medicine” to that prescribed by your doctor. No longer would your medicines be prescribed by the doctor who knows your medical history – instead, it would be a pharmacist acting in accordance with a protocol drawn up by the government.These measures break public promise the government has made: “If there are any shortages of particular medicines after EU exit, the same system will be in place – your doctor will advise you of the best alternative to treat your condition.”This latest legislation has alarmed medical organisations, some of whom did not even know of the proposals. The National AIDS Trust, for example, has said: “We are deeply concerned that these changes were made without proper consultation. Prescribing HIV medication is a complex process which must take account of a multitude of factors. The only person qualified to safely alter the medication prescribed to a person living with HIV is that person’s HIV consultant.”Staggeringly, the government seem to be driven by a desire to save costs on a no-deal Brexit. Its own explanatory notes state that: “The main benefits of the protocol would be the NHS cost savings associated with GP time” – even though, as if it were mere afterthought, “there may be some risks to patients.”We at the Good Law Project believe that there is another big problem with serious shortage protocols: they are unlawful. Last week we wrote to the government threatening urgent judicial review proceedings if they refused to withdraw the power to make them.How should the government respond to such a threat? It seems unthinkable that it might take the country over the no-deal cliff without knowing whether it can use a key measure to try and alleviate harm to the health of millions of people. It has even recognised in correspondence that there are “potentially serious public health implications” if SSPs cannot be used. So how, in such circumstances, can it contemplate no deal?We think it’s time the government came clean. Serious shortage protocols could be dangerous and may well be unlawful. No responsible government should expose its own people to such risks. We need to delay Brexit – and plan properly.If you wish to support Good Law Project’s judicial review of serious shortage protocols, you can do so here.• Jolyon Maugham QC is a barrister and director of the Good Law Project"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da33d20373125c50cfd476ee4a4308f4390df9e/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bf03cc55021c7461d929a753b03e0de","title":"can data sharing improve our wellbeing","story":"As the use of artificial intelligence becomes increasingly widespread across the health industry, could machine-powered software help reduce illnesses?Healthcare is on the brink of a technological revolution that will transform the way we think about medicine and how we care for ourselves.Voice and digital assistants could one day detect suicidal tendencies in the speech patterns of users and refer them to therapy. Hospitals will use algorithms to analyse data about populations to understand when to expect a flu outbreak. Doctors will turn to artificial intelligence (AI) systems to help them prescribe the right drugs.These innovations will be enabled by harnessing the abundance of data flowing from medical equipment, electronic health records, wearable devices, analysis of our DNA and even our digital communications.For Femi Ladega, vice-president and chief technology officer at DXC Technology’s healthcare ision, the advent of AI will offer new avenues for turning data into a medical tool that will be just as important as stethoscopes, scalpels and x-rays. “We are in a new wave of healthcare where the use of AI and machine learning will start to turn the deluge of data we have got into contextual specific insights that enables truly personalised care. That is where the industry is heading,” he says.These new insights and knowledge from data will become vital – doctors won’t just access data about a patient. AI-powered software will also tell them about the implications of that data – to make them actionable. If they are about to prescribe drugs to a patient, the system would automatically recommend the best medicine for the patient, taking into account many more characteristics and factors than it would be possible for the doctor to consider. This would then be presented to the doctor to prescribe.But for this new reality to come about, physicians and healthcare providers must first find effective technology that allows them to gather, share and analyse data.As a step on the path to this digitally enabled health system, DXC has launched a new data platform that allows health providers to connect information from a range of sources such as care records and medical history. DXC Open Health Connect brings together data from hospitals, doctors’ surgeries and electronic medical records, and offers doctors context about the implications of that data. The system can help doctors identify at-risk patients and suggest preemptive measures to prevent them from getting ill, reducing the chance of them being admitted to hospital.“We are trying to use the profile of an inidual to give them a wellness programme,” says Ladega. In future, for instance, sophisticated software systems will analyse patient profiles to identify those who are at risk of developing diabetes, then target preventive programmes at them. If the outside temperature drops below a certain level, software could analyse a hospital’s local population to determine the number of people who are susceptible to lung disease or asthma at lower temperatures. That insight could be used to estimate hospital demand and predict that in the following hour or two, there is likely to be a rise in visits to A\u0026ampE. The hospital could then put in place plans to cope with the rise in numbers.Another way AI could improve healthcare is by using digital assistants to detect depression among users from the words they use when interacting with the assistants and from their tone of voice. Men are often reluctant to talk about their mental wellbeing, but they may be willing to open up to a robotic voice assistant. “The system converts the voice to text and picks out sensitive words that could highlight the risk of depression. Once you pass a threshold, the system will automatically book you an appointment or create a channel for you to talk to somebody,” explains Ladega.DXC uses a model of data sharing called FHIR, pronounced “fire”, which stands for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. This is a standard for sharing health information across IT systems. So, if someone is involved in a road traffic accident, the hospital could access their medical history and other relevant information from all their previous healthcare interactions. FHIR allows health providers to build APIs, pieces of software that allow different computer systems to share information.“That model forces the democratisation of information in a standard way,” says Ladega. “In this day and age of big data, you have to work on open data, and this has got to be based on open architecture. That way, you remove any constraints to information sharing,” he adds.He predicts that the 21st century will see the rise of a “genomic generation”, who use personal genomic services to analyse their own DNA data to understand their genomic makeup. This will influence their lifestyle choices, for instance avoiding sunbathing if they are genetically prone to skin cancer. Citizens will take greater responsibility for their own healthcare using data from wearables and fitness trackers.“The genomic generation is going to bring a different dimension to the patient-provider relationship, and we will feel better for it. The trend I see is that health and wellness is going to be redefined in the next five to seven years,” says Ladega.The new era of shared data will bring about improvements in health similar in significance to historic advances in medicine such as vaccines and penicillin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49b87a4a7c08acf50111722f4959a765faf3c0c0/0_130_5100_3062/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6a261fee371654733811354d7a88037","title":"what is your experience of zero tolerance behaviour policies in schools","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers, parents and young people about their schools’ discipline policiesThis year has seen increasing criticism for zero tolerance behaviour policies used by schools – from putting children in isolation booths as punishment for breaking school rules, to excluding them for apparently minor indiscretions.This month the TES and Schools Week reported that a multi-academy trust had been using a strategy called “flattening the grass”, in which students were publicly humiliated in assemblies and made to cry in order to establish the MAT’s expectations of students’ behaviour when it takes over a new school.Whether you’re a teacher, parent or young person over the age of 16, we’d like to hear from you.What experience do you have of zero tolerance behaviour policies?

The latest swimwear, from high-tech trunks to whimsical costumes, makes it easier than ever to take the plungeNationwide, there is a boom in wild swimming. Even the fashion pack, rarely ones to embrace the great outdoors, have got involved. Anne-Marie Curtis, editor-in-chief of Elle, swims regularly at the Kenwood Ladies’ Pond on Hampstead Heath in London, as does designer Louise Gray.Four years ago, printmaker Katherine Anteney entered a triathlon. While training, she remembered how good swimming felt – the peace and the adrenaline, the pleasure of spreading your fingers wide in cool water or kicking your legs in a firm breaststroke. She began visiting lakes regularly. “At first I wore a wetsuit, but ditched that pretty quickly as it felt like it kept me removed from the water.”I’ve swum in the ladies’ pond every week, all year round, for three years. My swimming partner, Sarah Regh, whom I met in the pond during my first ever visit, is an expert in unusual swimwear. Her current costume is covered in a bold shark print. “It’s from Batoko and is made from recycled materials,” she says. Her top tip is flip-flops for the dash from changing hut to water’s edge. “I would pick flip-flops over hat, gloves and swimsuit, any day they are key to warming up quickly. They provide vital insulation between the ground and my body and allow me to focus on getting dry.”Today, Anteney’s favourite swimming spot is the river Test in Southampton. Even in the winter, she will swim a handful of times a month, and the local train now greets her and her swimming partner Pam with a hoot. “Where we get changed is called the Slab. It’s a concrete culvert right next to the tracks on the mainline to Salisbury. We always get a honk and a wave. Those poor fellas have seen our bare bums too many times.”Anteney advises swimming with a companion for camaraderie and motivation. “We swim upstream heads up and chatting, and then back with head-down crawl. In the winter, we wear woolly hats and I keep my glasses on, because then I have an excuse not to put my face in.” Occasionally, they go in the dark with head torches. She would advise investing in neoprene shoes for warmth. “I hate getting mud on my feet,” she says. “Earplugs help keep you warmer but they mean you can’t do much chatting, so I’ve stopped wearing them. I have learned the importance of getting warm quickly afterwards and anticipating the afterdrop (where your core temp carries on dropping after you get out). I couldn’t live without my Dryrobe.” This combines a windproof outer shell with a synthetic lambswool lining.If the thought of plunging into the cold – and open water often is cold, even in the warmer weather – in just a swimming costume fills you with horror, a wetsuit is always an option. Consider the thickness carefully, says consultant Charlotte Goodhart, who swims in the West Reservoir at Manor House, north London. “My advice would be to wear a wetsuit of at least 2mm thickness – the water might not feel that cold but you’ll gradually get quite chilly – though gloves and socks aren’t as necessary.”Ben Alden-Falcone is a sea man. He swims regularly along the Kent coast, in particular in the Walpole Bay Tidal Pool in Margate. Three years ago, he swam the Channel as part of a relay of three. “I definitely got the short straw starting first in the pitch black of a very cold early morning. Then, on my next hour stretch as the sun came up, plume upon plume of red jellyfish surfaced. You couldn’t swim round them – there were thousands. I got stung to bits – it looked like I had been whipped.”Unlike Goodhart, he still wouldn’t recommend a wetsuit: “For me, a wetsuit kills a key joy of cold-water swimming – the freedom. I want to feel the water, even if a twig or bit of seaweed makes me jump occasionally.” He wears tight swimming shorts instead. And goose fat, for the Channel, surely? “I think the goose fat is a bit of a rumour we had Vaseline to stop chafing.” He’s a fan of ear plugs, but says the best preparation is temperature-checking. “My No 1 tip is always acclimatise to the water temperature (especially if you don’t go regularly) by dipping your feet into the water for a couple of minutes first. This will cool your body temperature and reduce risk of a shock to the heart.”Before you grab your goggles, consider your swimming aims, says Anteney. “The last thing it’s about is exercise,” she says. “It’s about being in the water and feeling it all around you. Being at eye level with nature. An early-morning swim before work makes the rest of the day manageable. It keeps me sane – even though everyone else thinks we are insane.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The latter will likely prove a hit on the red carpet – where the label regularly appears – thanks to it drawing the fine line between empowerment and sensuality. Meanwhile, the masculine military-style wool coats that opened the show in grey, white and black, showed that it wasn’t just about clothes for a special occasion.Staged in a giant mirrored box erected in the Fontaine du Trocadero against the glittering backdrop of the Eiffel Tower, Vaccarello created something of a light show of his own. Inside, a lightrod installation behind two-way mirrored glass was on such a large scale that it rivalled the lights of the famous landmark outside.The second part of the show, in which models walk in UV light on the other side of the giant screens did, however, serve more than a creative purpose. Under an ultraviolet lens, the new line of flouro shoes that the brand is introducing for next season seemed to walk themselves, making the footwear the most memorable takeaway from the collection.It was a savvy move given Vaccarello’s form for creating the most lusted after shoes of seasons past. The slouchy, thigh-high boots covered in 3,000 rhinestones on each foot, which he designed in 2017 and which went viral after Rihanna wore them, were on waiting lists around the world despite their $10,000 (£7,545) price tag. Saint Laurent will be hoping that they help them make their revenue target of €2bn by 2022, which CEO Francesca Bellettini said last November they were on track to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/340ca58f071f34d34046d6e12885f0b192f10eba/0_93_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ebb6e46bc105884caf5d04b30e83601","title":"alejandro gonzalez inarritu first mexican cannes film festival jury president","story":"The Birdman director will oversee prize deliberations at the film festival in May, making him the first person from his country to do soAlejandro González Iñárritu has been named president of this year’s Cannes film festival.

Though unapologetically sweet, it’s surprisingly light – until you add a big dollop of ice-cream, of course.50g unsalted butter, plus extra to grease175g medjool dates1 tsp bicarbonate of soda75g walnuts (optional)80g golden caster sugar80g dark muscovado sugar1 pinch salt2 cloves175g flour1 tsp baking powder2 eggsFor the sauce115g unsalted butter75g golden caster sugar40g dark muscovado sugar140ml double creamHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6) and get the butter out of the fridge to soften, if you haven’t already. Stone and roughly chop the dates – though sticky, this process should be relatively easy with a small, sharp knife.Medjool dates are softer and richer in flavour than some other common varieties, so are the best ones to use for this recipe, if you can find them. Put all the ingredients for the sauce in a small pan. Put over a low heat until the butter melts, stirring regularly to encourage it, then mix together, turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Simmer for about four minutes, until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.Grease a 24cm x 24cm baking dish with butter. Pour half the sauce into the prepared dish, tip it this way and that until the base is completely coated, then put the dish in the freezer while you make the batter. Leave the rest of the sauce in the pan for now. Boil a kettle of water.Put the dates and bicarb in a heatproof bowl and pour over 300ml boiling water to cover. Leave them to soften while you get the rest of the batter ingredients ready.If you’re using the walnuts (pecans would also be nice), heat a small, dry frying pan over a medium-high heat, toast them until fragrant, then tip out on to a board and roughly chop.Put the butter and both sugars into a large bowl or food mixer, add a pinch of salt, then beat vigorously until very light and fluffy. Grind the cloves to a fine powder and, in a separate bowl, whisk with the flour and baking powder. Beat the eggs in a cup or jug.Beat the eggs, a little at a time, into the butter and sugar mixture, until thoroughly incorporated, then use a large metal spoon to fold in the dry ingredients, being careful to knock as little air out of the mixture as possible. Finally, fold in the dates and their soaking water, plus the walnuts, if using.Take the dish out of the freezer and pour the batter on top of the sauce. Tip the dish to level out the batter, then bake for about 30 minutes, until just firm to the touch in the centre. Towards the end of the cooking time, reheat the remaining sauce in the pan.Heat the grill to medium. Using a skewer or similar, poke small holes all across the top of the baked pudding, then pour the sauce over the top. Remembering it will still be hot, put the dish under the grill until the top is molten and bubbling – keeping a watchful eye on it, because sugar is quick to burn.Serve the sticky toffee pudding immediately, with ice-cream, custard, creme fraiche or Greek yoghurt. Alternatively, bake the pudding itself ahead of time, but don’t add the remaining sauce until you’re ready to serve. Cover the pudding with foil, then reheat in a 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4 oven for about 20 minutes, then continue with step 8."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ab12b846055213ddb9fcf12ac8fdd67944fe1ec/36_75_2487_1492/master/2487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e689b32c5c7a664a955456882e562e7","title":"which defenders have scored hat tricks from open play football the knowledge","story":"Plus: cross-national cousins, bossing the FA Cup without lifting it and the greatest age difference between team-mates. Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“How many defenders have scored a hat-trick from open play?” asks Jack Tanner.Not that many, is the short answer, if our pretty extensive search is anything to go by, Jack. There are few defenders who have achieved the feat with the aid of a penalty, Denis Irwin, Fernando Hierro and – bizarrely – Gary Gillespie among them. And then we move on to examples of defenders who achieved the feat from open play but not while playing in a defensive position. For some reason we can’t fathom, Steve Staunton, a left-back for most of his career, leapt off the bench to score a second-half hat-trick for Liverpool at Wigan in the League Cup in October 1989, but he replaced Ian Rush in a forward position. No defender has scored a hat-trick in the Premier League, though Steve Watson, converted from a full-back into an attacking midfielder by David Moyes at Everton, did the trick in a 4-0 win over Leeds in 2003 so is about as close as it gets (Irwin’s Manchester United hat-trick came in Europe).But if we want a perfect example to answer the question, how about goal-plundering centre-back Aden Flint, who scored three goals from open play for Bristol City in an extraordinary 8-2 walloping of beach-bound Walsall on 3 May 2015, as City celebrated winning League One in style. Flint’s goals consisted of a volley, an insouciant back-heelrabona finish (obviously) and a close-range tap-in. “I said to the strikers at the end of the game that they should be ashamed of themselves when someone like Aden has gone out there and scored three,” cackled manager Steve Cotterill. Flint scored 15 in total for the season. No wonder Middlesbrough forked out £7m for him.“Former central defender and current conservative politician Alpay Özalan scored three goals from open play for Turkey during 2002 World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia,” writes Önder Susam. “The then-Aston Villa player scored two headers and poked one into the empty net, which was from an offside position. Those were his only goals for Turkey in any official game. I wish he was remembered for this rather than his antics against Portugal in Euro 2000 or his shambolic defending against Switzerland in a 2006 World Cup play-off.”Here’s Chelsea centre-back Magdalena Eriksson scoring a hat-trick of headers from corners for Sweden against Iran in 2016. One, two, three …Oh, and Stan van den Buijs scored a hat-trick for Anderlecht in January 1995. The trouble is, he was playing for Germinal Ekeren, the poor chap.However, Bernd Jatzwauk has unearthed a four-goal gem from the Bundesliga. “Bernard Dietz scored four goals as a defender for MSV Duisburg against Bayern Munich on 5 November 1977.” They came in the 20th, 49th, 75th and 78th minutes in the 6-3 win. “He went on to become the most prolific goalscoring defender in the history of the Bundesliga with 77 goals.” None appear to have been penalties or free-kicks.“I was listening to the BBC’s World Football podcast recently where Pat Nevin shared the surprise news that he and Terry Butcher are cousins,” reports Michael Fryer. “Does anyone know of any other cousins who played for different countries?”Dirk Maas points us in the direction of Mark Viduka (Australia) and Luka Modric (Croatia). Unlikely relations you might think, but they are cousins through the former Leeds striker’s father, Joe, who emigrated from Croatia in the 1960s. Dirk has done his homework, adding that Marcos Assunçao (Brazil) and Marcos Senna (Spain) are cousins, as are Manuel Fernandes (Portugal) and Gelson Fernandes (Switzerland), and Granit Xhaka (Switzerland) and Armando Sadiku (Albania). Former Wales defender Eric Young can name the ‘Guv’nor’ as a cousin, former England and Manchester United midfielder Paul Ince.“There is at least one example of brothers playing for different countries,” writes Harry Curtis. “John Hollins (Chelsea, QPR and Arsenal) played one game for England in 1967, while his older, goalkeeper brother Dave Hollins (Brighton and Hove Albion, Newcastle United and Mansfield Town) played 11 games for Wales.” Pete Stanford chips in with a cross-national brotherly example too. “Chris Nurse (ex-Aldershot Town, Tamworth and Puerto Rico Islanders) played for Guyana, while his older brother Jon (ex-Dagenham \u0026amp Redbridge and Stevenage Borough) played for Barbados.And how about the Boateng brothers? Kevin-Prince has represented Ghana, while his half-brother, Jérôme, is a Germany international.“Which manager has won the most FA Cup games without ever lifting the trophy?” ponders Steven Wild.Chris Rawson thinks it has to be ‘Ol Big Head: “From Brian Clough’s early beginnings at Hartlepool United in October 1965, to the last sad few weeks at Nottingham Forest in May 1993, the great man’s various teams won 40 FA Cup ties over that period. He only ever managed one team in a final, the infamous 1991 game, in which Paul Gascoigne was carried off, and Tottenham won 2-1 after an own goal from Des Walker.”“Cesc Fàbregas is linking up really well with Dennis Bergkamp, a man old enough to be his father,” wrote Rob Coke, in August 2004. “What is the greatest age difference between two team-mates in English football?”Cesc Fàbregas (17) and Dennis Bergkamp (35) dovetailed gloriously in Arsenal’s storming start to the 2004-05 season. But they were nowhere near the record. In the absence of any cold, hard facts on the subject, we had to settle for a couple of examples: during USA 94, Roger Milla (42) and Marc-Vivien Foé (19) lined up alongside each other for Cameroon. But no tale of old and young team-mates would be complete without the word ‘Beasant’: Big Dave (43) and Leighton Baines (17) both took part in Wigan’s LDV Vans Trophy defeat to Doncaster in November 2002.“Which other players have ‘done a Kepa’ and refused to be substituted,” wonders George Jones.“Leicester’s sacking of Claude Puel has left loanee signing Youri Tielemans in an unusual situation,” begins Padraic McCafferty. “The Belgian played under both Leonardo Jardim and Thierry Henry at Monaco and will soon be playing under his fourth club manager in a single season. Has there ever been a player who has played under as many?”“I’m a (very) amateur footballer, and was recently forced to sub myself off having suffered a migraine attack during a floodlit evening game.

Politicians everywhere should draw inspiration from the Chelsea keeper, whose decision to decline to be substituted by Maurizio Sarri is regarded by some as the harbinger of Britain’s complete social breakdown (more on that possibility later).First, though, to events at Wembley Stadium. As Kepa put it in a statement issued in the immediate wake of the action: “I regret how the end of the match has been portrayed.” As always with these passive formulations, one is left to surmise who or what is the subject of the verb. In this case, given the verb in question is “portrayed” and the events in question were taking place on the medium of live television, delivered in real time via multiple camera angles, the subject of the verb is basically “your own eyes”. Kepa is accusing your own eyes of stitching him up.In some ways, this apology template is simply a new and improved version of apologising to “anyone who may have been offended”. The latter classic formulation also suggests the entire thing is somehow the fault of the offendee, who has taken an active decision to lose their shit – a decision that the bigger person is now wearily having to deal with.However – and inevitably, perhaps – the above turned out not to be Kepa’s last apology on the subject. Late on Monday night, a formal Chelsea statement was forthcoming, in which the £71m keeper took another run at the situation. “I have thought a lot more about yesterday’s events,” this asserted. “Although there was a misunderstanding, on reflection, I made a big mistake with how I handled the situation.” Now you tell us. The news comes as something of a guilt trip for those of us who had already sent our own eyes to bed with no supper for their inaccurate portrayal.The wider issue, of course – and there must always be a wider issue! – is what Sunday’s drama of insubordination means for football. Does the game’s Doomsday Clock stand at two minutes from anarchy? Should dissenting players be keelhauled, as pirate mutineers once were, but which would now involve being dragged beneath and round the chassis of a Bugatti Chiron (quite a squeeze)? There seems to be a developing consensus in some quarters that footballers are these days multimillion-pound corporations, whose power and private staff will eventually relegate all managers to junior personnel.I have some sympathy with the notion that managers are not quite what they used to be. But blaming it all on player power seems to look the wrong way, when the players too are grist to much bigger mills.The brilliant film writer David Thomson (a lifelong Chelsea supporter, as it happens) has written interestingly of what happened to footballers once the game became primarily a televised spectacle, and particularly since the technical innovations and multiple camera angles that the likes of Sky have brought. Long ago the stadium fans were a player’s only audience, but elite footballers now “know they are part of a system of close-ups and slow-motion”. Hugely performative goal celebrations would have been regarded as bad taste in the past today they are what the medium demands. Players have become far more theatrical to adapt to the small screens via which they are mostly seen – and so have managers, as Sarri’s operatic gesticulations on Sunday also demonstrated.Even were it not so bound up with the big money, that specific consciousness of oneself as a TV star arguably made footballers more inidualistic and less bound by the sense of subservience to a team. Furthermore, the marketers’ attempts to reach and ensnare vast global audiences has deliberately exacerbated the notion of football as a dramatic TV show rather than “merely” a sport. Plotlines are spoken of and personal rivalries played up in a fashion once the preserve of soap opera.But football is no longer just a TV event it is now a social media one, too. Executives at leading clubs speak unabashedly of “content”, which might be actual football, but might equally be some made‑for‑Instagram stunt. The biggest club brands consider themselves to be in the entertainment industry.To an extent we have yet to fully understand, we have all been corrupted by the mediums via which we mostly experience football – first television, but now social media. And increasingly, we all collude in our own corruption. The Sarri-Kepa bust-up was widely reviewed as the most watchable two and a half minutes of Sunday’s final – and you could tell this, because people were lighting up social media with the observation. You don’t get that with 30 minutes of serviceable but uneventful play – much to the disappointment of the various platforms, whose business model relies on drama. In as turbo-capitalist an environment as top‑flight football, then, you have to assume the market will instinctively adapt and provide this type of content more and more. There are plenty of modern football executives who will privately admit that a killer clip is more important than any match for driving global fan engagement and value for their sponsors.Perhaps this is why Chelsea as a club feels able to “move past” the histrionics of Sunday. It might have been a headache for the manager, but he’s only at best a supporting actor. For the big studio moneymen, that two-and-a-half-minute clip was an excellent day at the office. Drama – and it doesn’t really matter what sort – is always a great result."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8a24138473b773ae539d32c401e0e3082c541e8/0_336_8196_4917/master/8196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2de35c032f923c30d2761663013ca2e3","title":"david hockaday leeds massimo cellino manager","story":"The former manager recalls his whirlwind 70 days at Leeds, including transfer frustrations and ‘a dysfunctional squad’From a lavish stay in the Dolomites to 1am wake-up calls and dressing-downs at Elland Road courtesy of Massimo Cellino, there are so many bemusing and bewildering moments to reflect on that David Hockaday knows he could write a book. So much so that, after an hour, it feels as if we have barely scratched the surface about his wild, white-knuckle 70-day ride at Leeds United.Infamously parachuted into one of the biggest jobs in the country almost five years ago on the back of three covert meetings with the then owner, the 61-year-old became the first victim of the madness under the previous regime at Leeds.Other than his regret at failing to shore things up at Bradford, when Leeds were leading with eight minutes to play in his final game, he is immensely proud to have followed managers such as Don Revie. Listening to Hockaday, who since 2016 has been head of male football at South Gloucestershire and Stroud college (SGS) on the outskirts of Bristol, speak brutally about his six matches in charge is staggering Hockaday believes he has greater resources – in terms of the staff – at SGS than he did at Leeds.“But he said: ‘I want you to be my head coach.’ I said: ‘What, like your manager?’ And he said: ‘Yes, I want you to be my coach.’ I was like: ‘OK, interesting,’ and I was sort of playing poker. I said: ‘I can handle the coaching, that’s not a problem,’ but said: ‘There’s a few things we need to talk about.’ He said: ‘You can recommend players but I will have the final say.’ He said: ‘You pick the team, you train them and I don’t interfere with that,’ and, to be fair, he never ever did.”Hockaday says he was shut down after recommending Virgil van Dijk, then of Celtic, as well as Craig Cathcart and Mark Hudson as preferred centre-back options. A move for Conor Coady, available on a free, never made it past Cellino either. “Flipping heck,” Hockaday says, asked about what might have been. “Don’t make me cry. I was scratching my head being told ‘no’ about those I had recommended while we were getting in these Italian-based players who were nowhere near it. That’s what killed me.”Hockaday fought to convince Cellino, who he says liked to be referred to as Mr President, to pay for food after training. “I basically had an under-23s team and a lot of disenchanted senior players. It was the most dysfunctional squad I’ve ever played with, trained with, coached – whatever. It was a terrible environment.“I don’t know what they are doing with the swimming pool at Thorp Arch now but you know when you see the westerns with all the tumbleweed? It was like that, because none of it was being used. It was a massive facility ‘too expensive to run’.”The real fun and games, Hockaday says, began when he and coach Neil Sullivan took goalkeeper Marco Silvestri away from the squad to work on his kicking. “I found out quite quickly that the Italians reported back to the president … I had a phone call from Cellino to say: ‘Get yourself to Elland Road.’ I get there and he says: ‘What are you doing, embarrassing my goalkeeper?’ I said: ‘Right, hang on a minute, what’s he like with the ball at his feet?’ He went: ‘He’s not that good.’ I said: ‘Does he need to work on it?’ He said: ‘Yeah.’ I said: ‘Do you know what we’ve done? We’ve taken him to another field and worked on it.’ He said: ‘Good work, well done.’ That sort of thing went on every day.”Since joining SGS, Hockaday has enjoyed great success. The defender Kasper Lopata, who joined Brighton, and the striker Antoine Semenyo, who joined Bristol City, are the most salient success stories, and Saikou Janneh, also signed by City, is another export of the full-time programme.“I’m going to leave a legacy here,” Hockaday says. “I’m going to build something incredible.” As for Leeds, he smiles. “It was a brilliant experience, I learned a lot about myself. ‘Can I handle the shit?’ Yes, I can. ‘Can I handle players at that level?’ I think so. I’m such a massive Leeds fan now I love them to bits. It was only three months but it is a massive part of my life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1d9590eb20d82c52a73a41139117578f6aa6f09/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f78b608a63a600126e9571834545a3bd","title":"january transfers europe premier league","story":"The transfer window hasn’t changed much in the Premier League but some new signings are impressing on the continentBy Martin Laurence for WhoScoredA month after the January transfer window closed, one could almost forget it happened for most Premier League clubs. Very few players made eye-catching transfers and even fewer have gone on to make a significant impact at their new club.Gonzalo Higuaín’s move to Chelsea was perhaps the biggest of the month and he enjoyed an impressive start in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge, scoring twice against Huddersfield in his home league debut. However, he hasn’t scored since then and did not start for Chelsea in the League Cup final. New signings have had a bit more success across the continent. Here are six who have made an immediate impression at their new clubs.Even though Tyler Adams had been a first-team regular with New York Red Bulls for the best part of two years, the young midfielder has exceeded all expectations at RB Leipzig. The 20-year-old USA international has started four games for his new club and they have won all four. He was not in the starting line-up for their league game against Hoffenheim on Monday night, but he came on at half time and helped swing the momentum in Leipzig’s favour to ensure they earned a point. With one assist, 14 tackles, eight interceptions and 10 dribbles, Adams has adapted to his new surroundings in no time. Rating: 7.36It was a surprise to see Luis Muriel left out of Fiorentina’s starting XI at the weekend, but boy did he make an impact from the bench. The 27-year-old scored a spectacular free-kick from all of 35 yards as his new side came from 3-1 down to steal a point at the death against Inter, taking his goal tally to five in seven games for Fiorentina.Muriel is making up for lost time after a frustrating end to his Sevilla career. He played just 364 minutes in La Liga and the Europa League this season for the club – but still managed to pick up three goals and three assists. Whether played on the left of a front three or through the middle, the Colombian forward has already proven a shrewd signing. Rating: 7.42Monaco were the most active club in the January transfer window – and for good reason. They needed their new signings to make a quick impact and Gelson Martins has been an instant hit. With Leonardo Jardim back at the helm, Monaco have clawed themselves out of the relegation zone, picking up 10 points from their last four matches – more than Thierry Henry managed in his 12 league games in charge – though, in fairness, the rookie manager did not have Martins in his side.The Portuguese winger left Sporting Lisbon for Atlético Madrid in the summer on a free transfer and failed to make any impression whatsoever in Spain – with his playing style never likely to suit Diego Simeone – but he has been influential in Monaco’s resurgence. His four appearances have coincided with the club’s unbeaten run and he has played his part in all four matches. He picked up an assist in his league debut – a 2-1 win over Toulouse – and has scored in his last three games. Rating: 7.46Martins struggled to win over Simeone, but Álvaro Morata already has the trust of his new manager. Much maligned over the last year at Chelsea, the 26-year-old has had his confidence restored in Madrid. He scored his first goal for the club in their 2-0 win over Villarreal on Sunday, which followed his assist for the only goal of the game as Atleti scraped past Rayo Vallecano the week before.His hold-up play has been strong so far. With eight shots, 10 successful dribbles and 21 aerial duels won in his first four league appearances for his new club, the striker is bidding to regain his place in the Spain squad and has every chance of doing just that. Rating: 7.52Poland international Krzysztof Piatek just loves a fresh start. The 23-year-old left his homeland to sign for Genoa in the summer and scored in nine consecutive appearances at the start of his career in Italy – scoring 14 times in that spell – to earn a move to Milan.He has gone on another scoring streak for his new employers, scoring in each of his first five starts for the club. Piatek already has five league goals in as many Serie A outings for Milan, including a sensational cross-body volley at Atalanta. He cost £31.5m yet could still prove to be a bargain as the club chase a Champions League return. Rating: 7.53Grifo has a habit of returning to his old clubs. The Italian has had two spells at Hoffenheim and this is now his second stint at Freiburg, the club where he has been at his best. He played a key role as they club won promotion to the Bundesliga in the 2015-16 season and he is scoring goals for them again this season.He has already won the fans’ hearts for a second time, having scored twice and set up two more goals since rejoining the club. In fact, he has had a direct hand in more goals (four) than he managed before the winter break at Hoffenheim. With 22 goals and 21 assists in a little over two seasons with Freiburg over his two spells, there is clearly something in the water in the Black Forest as far as the 25-year-old is concerned.

There were no details on pricing the announcement said it would be “competitive”.However, BritBox will not have the latest BBC and ITV shows, which will remain available through the catch-up BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub services. Other broadcasters are expected to join the service later, with Channel 4 known to have taken part in discussions, which were revealed by the  last year.ITV has pledged to invest up to £65m in the joint venture over the next two years. The publicly funded BBC would not comment on whether it was putting a similar amount of money into the project.The decision means British broadcasters are likely to stop licensing their archive material to services such as Netflix to try to drive subscribers to the new UK service, which will operate on a fraction of the budget of its deep-pocketed US rivals.The ITV chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said BritBox would be pitched as an add-on for British households that already had one streaming service: “It’s complementary to Netflix because it’s doing a very different thing.”She said Netflix commissioned shows on a global basis but BritBox’s original material would be aimed at UK viewers: “When we’re commissioning content we’re looking at it working in the UK specifically. It is a permanent, comprehensive home for the widest range of British content available in one place.”The decision to launch the service came a decade after Project Kangaroo, a proposal for a similar British cross-channel streaming service, was blocked on competition grounds. Many in the British TV industry blame the Competition Commission’s decision for opening the door for Netflix to dominate.This time around, the media regulator, Ofcom, said it welcomed the BritBox proposal because it wanted to see British broadcasters “collaborating to keep pace with global players, by offering quality UK content that’s available to viewers whenever and however they want to watch it”.BritBox is already available in the US, where it has 500,000 customers who pay for a selection of UK television shows. The new service will only be available to British subscribers. They will be able to watch it on holiday within the EU, but only if the government strikes a trade deal with Brussels.McCall admitted the existing ITV Hub catch-up service was not good enough and “very clunky”, but said ITV was investing heavily in improving it.She said: “If you look at it today, the look and feel has already changed. It’s much cleaner and nicer to be on. You’ll also be led through it in a much better way. There’s a whole load of things to come.”ITV programmes are available on ITV Hub for a month after their initial broadcast, in line with the BBC’s iPlayer policy. However, the BBC is seeking approval to make many shows available on iPlayer for up to a year, which could affect when material becomes exclusively available on Britbox.The announcement that talks on Britbox had almost concluded was timed to coincide with ITV’s annual financial results, which show the broadcaster’s profits dipped slightly in a tough market.The company warned this year could be tougher, since 2018 was aided by strong advertising in a World Cup year and success in its production business, which makes shows for other channels, such as the BBC’s Bodyguard.The BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the streaming service would be “truly special”. “A new streaming service delivering the best homegrown content to the public who love it best,” he said. “The service will have everything from old favourites to recent shows and brand new commissions. It’s an exciting time for the viewing public.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73e4346a540e85d5e653f3f70a3e118d0ddf29ca/0_250_5035_3021/master/5035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a08d5e9d7d85e0a3c344f40cdac37d2c","title":"thank you for soundtracking my life readers tributes to mark hollis","story":"You have been reacting to the news Mark Hollis, lead singer of Talk Talk, has died at the age of 64Spirit of Eden is simply brilliant and one of the top ten albums of all time for me. I worked at both EMI and PolyGram (where they later signed to Polydor) and remember being staggered at the ambition, scope and sound of the albums he delivered. In my opinion, way beyond anything anyone else was doing at the time. Today, on my way to do the shopping I will listen once again to the music of a man who I genuinely think was a genius.Anybody who has never experienced the album, please do yourself a favour and sit down and listen to it. It is not instant and needs working at to appreciate it. But what that is brilliant comes to you without hard work? It needs time and works in its entirety as it does not have a “hit” anywhere near it. It is not designed for, nor does it work in today’s Spotify or iTunes single track format, nor did it for radio andor MTV at the time. The compression that the internet gives does no justice to the atmosphere achieved on the original vinyl either. But I will guarantee that once it has got into you, it will be with you forever, like all good things will satisfy your soul. A genuine masterpiece. Leon DepopeIt’s funny how things affect you. It makes no difference functionally, since Mark Hollis disappeared from public life in 1998, and I certainly never met him, but I’m heartbroken.He said (and I’m very much paraphrasing here) that he’d done everything he set out to do with those later albums, Laughing Stock especially, and that’s why he slowed down and eventually stopped. I suppose because he was able to express himself so perfectly, to listen to those records is to know him intimately. I always loved who I heard in them. A sweet soul, and an awkward bastard. I still cry every time I listen to Laughing Stock after more than a decade of listening to it on average every few days.Even if I imagined the person I heard, It makes me so sad to know that he’s not around any more. So effortly blessed. Andrew SamoyedIf there’s such a thing as a vibration of the human spirit, Mark Hollis knew how to make music to match its timbre.What an amazing, profound, integrity filled man he was. With some musicians you always look at their careers and think what might have been. Well, there’s no such regrets here.Farewell Mark, you’ve given me more inspiration then any artist on this planet. jesusjuice89We’ve lost a great, singular talent. Together with his bandmates in Talk Talk he produced some of the most incredible music to have ever emerged from the UK. Talk Talk’s progression over five records is utterly ridiculous. Genius.Living in the Netherlands, Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock will forever bind me to the idea of English pastoral melancholy, the essence of my Englishness. AnhagaTo this day I still listen in awe at what manifests forth and out of Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock especially in the darkest hours of time and of the soul. I cannot put my finger on it but as I get immersed in all the storm, swirl and silence of the music all I ever experience is light and rapture. To me they are the most disquieting yet magnificently uplifting records I have ever listened to, and yet I can only listen to them alone, the experience is too personal and intense to share. They are the most spiritual musical experience I have ever had and I cannot begin to document how much of an impact they have had on me and my life. Thank you, Mark Hollis. thegreatdarginiI’m struggling on this one so unexpected. I always had this feeling he’d just emerge again one day, drop an album – no fuss, no build-up … and, of course, it would be perfect. Just like Laughing Stock, just like the solo album and, of course, just like Spirit of Eden. When most of the music from the end of the 20th century is long forgotten those albums will still be played, admired and loved.Thanks (along with Paul and Lee) for helping to soundtrack my life, Mark. Love to your friends and family. As the trees come into leaf over the next few weeks I’ll do what I always do at this time of year - play The Colour of Spring over and over again. Mitch44I first heard Spirit of Eden when I was a sixth-form student almost 30 years ago. I’d heard nothing like it in my life. I knew of the early New Romantic Talk Talk, and some pretty catchy songs, but this? It was just from a different world ... I must have listened to that album thousands of times since and it still gives me goosebumps. There is simply nothing much to compare it with – perhaps only Laughing Stock and Hollis’s wonderful solo album.Some say that Bark Psychosis are their nearest comparison. They’re good, but they’re not Talk Talk. And Hex is great, but it’s not Spirit of Eden. Nothing can top that ... I always held out a faint hope he’d break cover and give us something new to wonder over. Sadly, what was always likely is now certain. Now is the time to turn the lights off, put the headphones on, and put the album on one more time. There will be goosebumps, all over again ... thanks Mark, you were a genius.

Costa said this was disingenuous, as all May had to do was go to the European Council and ask leaders to mandate the European commission to do a deal.When asked by an MP on the home affairs select committee what was wrong with the Costa amendment, Javid replied: “Nothing.”The Scottish National party MP Stuart McDonald asked for clarity: “So is the government supporting that now?”Javid replied that it was and asked: “When was the government not supporting it?”Costa, the son of Italian immigrants, has been quietly lobbying May over EU citizens’ rights for two years.More than 60 Conservative MPs have backed it, including the Brexiters Jacob Rees-Mogg, Dominic Raab and Iain Duncan Smith.On Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn also swung behind it, giving the amendment a strong chance of succeeding if selected by the Speaker for debate and a possible vote on Wednesday.Returning to the point at the end of the committee meeting, Javid admitted he had not heard what the prime minister had said about the Costa amendment, while confirming the government would be backing it, but said he had “low expectations” that it would result in a deal with the EU.“I’m perfectly happy with that amendment. What Mr Costa is doing with this amendment is trying to find more ways for parliament to give that reassurance,” he said.“This is a backbench amendment and the government supports the amendment in that it sets out to achieve the principles we all agree on.”The home secretary also came under sustained attack for the registration system the government is about to launch nationally for EU citizens.The Labour MP Stephen Doughty described the “settled status” scheme as a shambles and told Javid the basis of registration was discriminatory as it required EU citizens to request rights they already had.It would also recategorise them in a no-deal scenario as a cohort of the population who did not have rights if they did not have a settled status ID.“‘If people are having to secure those rights then, by definition, they don’t have those rights,” Doughty said. “You are at risk of having Windrush all over again.“In a hostile environment, they are going to be at risk of not being able to access services, not being able to access housing, potentially being detained by the immigration authorities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d040dbe548f2c78212e4b22598b73fd951144fb/20_0_1705_1023/master/1705.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7921ddd9bacc7b94609fe9969e8c51d0","title":"european media on theresa may brexit pledge to mps","story":"Prime minister’s offer of votes on rejecting no deal and extending article 50 gets frosty receptionThe European media are far from reassured by Theresa May’s latest pledge that MPs would have a chance next month both to reject a no-deal Brexit and extend article 50, with many pointing out it had done nothing to avert the risk of Britain crashing out.“Europhile MPs in parliament may have finally taken the upper hand,” wrote Libération in France. “Theresa May finally ceded to them what they had been demanding for months – votes on a no deal, and a delay of Britain’s exit from the EU.“But once again, the prime minister has neither resolved nor ruled out anything – certainly not the possibility that at the end of the day, parliament fails to agree on a deal at all. By the end of her speech, barely 30 MPs were present in the chamber to listen. Could it be that what she says is no longer very important?”Le Monde said that, despite the prime minister’s about turn on an extension, “Brexit uncertainty remains at its peak … It is hard to see how, if a deal that has taken two years to negotiate is rejected for a second time on 12 March, an extra three months will somehow allow the exit door to be found.”The timetable for May’s strategy of running down the clock was now “extremely tight”, the paper said, and “in no way excludes the hypothesis of the no-deal Brexit that a majority of MPs fear – but that the Eurosceptic minority, who have made the prime minister their willing hostage, so strongly desire.”In the Netherlands, de Volkskrant said the danger of the UK leaving the EU on 29 March without an agreement had, on balance, probably decreased. But it noted that the prime minister’s pledges had been made solely to ward off the threat of dozens of frontbench resignations.Would the tactic work? “The lower house will now vote on May’s deal, no deal and an extension on 12, 13 and 14 March respectively,” the paper said, adding ominously: “The following day is the ides of March – the day on which Romans settled their debts. And the day Julius Caesar was murdered.”In Spain, El País said it had been a question of “choosing the lesser of two evils, and Theresa May has decided to renounce her chief negotiating weapon in Brussels in order to avoid a crisis that would have done away with whatever remains of her authority”.The prime minister was “a master of the art of defending both one thing and its opposite”, the paper said, and was again trying to buy time. ABC’s Enrique Serbieto said differences in the UK parliament were “so deep that nothing guarantees a deal that hasn’t attracted agreement so far will manage to secure it within a few weeks.”Germany’s Die Zeit said British politics were “suddenly moving again”. Jeremy Corbyn had given way on a second referendum, it said, while May had promised parliament votes on a no deal and a “short, temporary” delay to Brexit.“With all these concessions, key players are pulling back from their hitherto fixed positions,” the paper said. “So has reason returned? No. It’s scarier than that.” May’s offer of a vote on an extension to article 50 was purely tactical, it reckoned.“This is just window dressing. She is ready to agree only to a short-term extension of article 50 – which the government would have had to ask for anyway in order to ensure there is time to ratify the deal. It is not necessarily a change of policy.”The Estonian daily Postimees focused on the publication of the government’s report on a no-deal Brexit, saying that by the government’s own admission, crashing out without an agreement would lead to “an economic disaster that would severely hamper business activity and the quality of life of ordinary people”.The UK “is not ready to leave the European Union on 29 March, such an exit will cost British businesses at least £13bn, and there will be major disruptions to supply chains as well as food shortages”, the paper said.Sweden’s Aftonbladet observed in an editorial that the new Independent Group of MPs were justified in claiming, in their slogan, that British politics is broken. “Within the ruling Conservative party, there is no majority for any of the exit options that can be accepted by the EU,” the paper said.“In parliament, there is no support for country crashing out without an agreement. What MPs could perhaps agree on is a kind of soft, Norway-style Brexit – but that would probably mean the defenestration of Theresa May, so no chance there.”There was, the Swedish paper concluded, “much to indicate that there will be no EU exit for the UK at the end of March. But the problem that is Brexit is going to plague British politics for a very long time to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef657c16c98d7d1a21065eb9446d498e07708c8d/0_4_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=213075b4ec951485b664295b4fcd2359 440w","title":"brexit debate latest news developments pmqs chair jacob rees mogg drops his calls for wholesale removal of backstop politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including the Commons debate on Brexit next steps, and Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQsThis is from the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn.Amendment C is the Spelman one and amendment F is the Cooper one.

He is focused on getting a deal, he says.Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, asks about the PM’s commitment to let MPs vote on extending article 50 if there is no deal by 14 March. Would MPs be able to table amendments changing the length of the article 50 extension?Lidington says it is up to the Speaker to decide what amendments are called. But he says, if there were no deal, section 13 of the EU Withdrawal Act would still apply (the clause that says MPs should get a vote on what happens next, on an amendable motion).David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, is opening the debate for the government.The Lib Dem MP Tom Brake asks Lidington to confirm that the government’s view of the Costa amendment is. The home secretary said he approved of it, Brake says, but Alberto Costa was sacked for tabling it.Lidington says he will address this in due course.John Bercow, the Speaker, announces that he is five calling amendments. Here they are, in the order in which they will be put to a vote.1) The Labour amendment. This requires the government to negotiate changes to the political declaration in line with the five Brexit demands set out in Jeremy Corbyn’s recent letter to Theresa May. It does not mention a second referendum.2) The SNP amendment. This says the UK should not leave the EU without a deal “under any circumstances”.3) The Caroline Spelman amendment. Jointly tabled with Jack Dromey, this would create time for a Commons debate tomorrow on the Yvette Cooper bill allowing the Commons to legislate to rule out a no-deal Brexit.4) The Alberto Costa amendment. This says the citizens’ rights part of the withdrawal agreement should be implemented even if there is no deal.5) The Yvette Cooper amendment. This states the commitments Theresa May gave yesterday about MPs being able to vote to extend article 50 on 14 March if no deal has been agreed and MPs have voted to rule out no deal.Voting will start at 7pm. If all amendments get put to a vote, and if there is a vote on the main motion, the voting will carry on until about 8.30pm.But, in practice, the main motion will probably go through on the nod, and it is quite possible that some or all of the backbench amendments could get pulled (depending on what assurances are given from the dispatch box). It could all be over by about 7.30pm.This is from Reuters.The European Union is ready to respond to any UK request for an extension to the Brexit timetable, and problems such as the European parliament elections can be overcome if there is the political will, Romania’s minister for European affairs said. George Ciamba told Reuters on Wednesday that Romania, as the current holder of the EU’s rotating presidency, was still making plans for a disorderly Brexit but was more optimistic after Theresa May paved the way for a delay beyond the planned Brexit date of 29 March.These are from HuffPost’s Paul Waugh.

They say food insecurity is strongly linked to poverty caused by austerity and welfare cuts and is driving widening health inequality.Food insecurity is generally defined as experiencing hunger, the inability to secure food of sufficient quality and quantity to enable good health and participation in society, and cutting down on food because of a lack of money.The decision, which took campaigners by surprise, was revealed at an informal meeting on Tuesday attended by the DWP, the Office for National Statistics, Public Health England and the Scottish and Welsh governments, as well as a number of food poverty charities.Ministers have for years resisted calls to bring England into line with the US and Canada by measuring food insecurity. Critics said this was to avoid shedding unwanted light on the impact of welfare policy and the public health consequences of being unable to eat regularly or healthily.The new measures closely reflect those called for in a private member’s bill being piloted through the Commons by Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck. She welcomed the move but said urgent action to address the causes of hunger was now needed.“It is a real pity that it has taken this long to be enacted, as every single day that has passed has been a day that another person has gone hungry. This positive step forward should not be used as an excuse for government inaction whilst this important data is being gathered,” said Lewell-Buck.The most recent best estimate of UK food insecurity, published by the Food Foundation in 2016 using UN data, suggested that in 2014 more than 8 million people lived in households that struggled to put food on the table, with more than half regularly going a whole day without eating.The DWP will add 10 questions about food buying and eating habits to its annual Family Resources Survey, which will be sent to 20,000 UK households in April. The data will be reported publicly in March 2021. Experts say the findings will help refine understanding of what drives hunger and food insecurity.The questions, which are based on US measures of food insecurity, will ask whether and how often households skipped meals, were unable to afford healthy food and went hungry or lost weight because they did not have enough money to buy sufficient food.The change of direction on measuring food insecurity comes just weeks after Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, conceded that the rollout of universal credit had contributed to an increase in food bank use, reversing previous ministerial claims that the two were not linked.The DWP said: “We always ensure we use the best possible evidence base for making policy. Building a better understanding of household food needs will help us to ensure we’re targeting support to those who need it most, so we’ve worked closely with stakeholders to develop tools to help us best collect this information.”Anna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation thinktank, said: “We’ve known for too long now that a disturbing number of people in the UK don’t have access to enough nutritious food, but our knowledge has been too patchy to identify real solutions. In the fifth-richest economy in the world, that’s a social justice disaster.”Niall Cooper, the director of Church Action on Poverty and chair of End Hunger UK, said: “It was over three years ago that End Hunger UK coalition members first called on the government to ‘count the hungry’. So we’re delighted, three years later, that food insecurity levels are finally going to be measured regularly.”A Food Foundation study last year found almost 4 million children in the UK lived in households that would struggle to afford to buy enough fruit, vegetables, fish and other healthy foods to meet official nutrition guidelines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9d4552994a409fc30700d3b97880ded7eb422ca/0_104_4300_2581/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c9114c851d9a8605059cbd087bc3b2b","title":"talking horses paul nicholls horse by horse cheltenham festival guide horse racing tips","story":"It is six years since Paul Nicholls enjoyed what could be seen as a ‘good’ Cheltenham Festival but the trainer leading the title race now has his most powerful team for yearsIt is six years since Paul Nicholls has enjoyed what could be seen as a “good” Cheltenham, when Rock On Ruby and Big Buck’s took the Champion Hurdle and Stayers’ Hurdle, respectively, in 2012.At the six Festivals since, he has saddled 11 winners: two each in the Fred Winter, Grand Annual, Martin Pipe Handicap Hurdle and Foxhunters’, one in the County Hurdle, one Coral Cup and a Champion Chase with Dodging Bullets in 2015.Nicholls has also finished the campaign as champion trainer in three of those years, so a good Cheltenham is not necessarily a pre-requisite for a successful season. All the same, a step up on his return from recent Festivals will probably be essential if Nicholls is to maintain his current lead of around £400,000 over Nicky Henderson and claim his first title for three years. The bookies still make him a narrow second-favourite to do so at around 6-4, and on Tuesday he showed off the horses he hopes will help to prove the layers wrong.Frodon (Gold CupRyanair Chase): I will confirm him for both and then will make a plan what we run him in depending on who is going to run in what race. We will run him in the race where we think he has the best chance. He is a tough horse who keeps on improving. He jumps and gallops and is rated 169 now having taken his form to a new level this year and is up there with the best – he will give a good account of himself whatever.Grand Sancy (Supreme Novice Hurdle): He’s had a great season and after being narrowly beaten in the Tolworth, he won well in the Kingwell Hurdle, beating Sceau Royal and Vision Des Flos. He gave them weight at Wincanton and really toughed it out with a good performance for a novice. He looks fantastic and has come out of the race well.Give Me A Copper (Ultima Chase): He is a very talented horse. He came back at Sandown the other day with a big weight and ran a real good fourth. He travelled and jumped well before getting a bit tired from the back of the second last. The plan is to go for the Ultima and then hopefully onto the Grand National.Topofthegame (RSA Chase): Topofthegame has entries in both the RSA Chase and the JLT Novice Chase, but he is almost certain to run in the RSA. He finished second at Kempton over Christmas to La Bague Au Roi and that is good form. We purposely haven’t run him since, he goes well fresh and we’re looking forward to running him. He is a high-class chaser in the making, jumps nicely, has lots of class and is one of our big chances.Quel Destin (Triumph Hurdle): He has won his last five races for us, having got beat at Chepstow first time up when he was inexperienced. He’s not been beaten since, has won a couple of Grade Two races including at Cheltenham and also won a Grade One at Chepstow in December. He is a proper tough four-year-old which you need in a Triumph. This lad has it all and is a proper jumping horse.Pic D’Orhy (Triumph Hurdle): His mark in this country based on his French form is 149 and he is a possible for the Triumph. He is a proper, big chasing type of horse who we bought with the future in mind. We took him to Wincanton last week for a racecourse gallop and we were thrilled with what we saw. I will either go straight for the Triumph with him or go to Aintree.Weld Al Emarat (4.10) is well worth an interest at around 3-1 in a useful handicap on the Fibresand at Southwell. Mick Easterby’s runner has won two of his last three starts at this track and put up his best performance to date over this trip last time out.Harbour Quay (3.05) can go one better on a good second on handicap debut last time, while Statistical (2.20) and Chef D’Equipe (2.50) should both go well on the card at Wincanton."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6671c6ede4c027444a3371afce53c8d671eb8893/446_94_5425_3254/master/5425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db90ff1044b56dfbfc9fa85469827afe","title":"craft beer enthusiasts guide to manchester","story":"A new craft-brew fest underlines Manchester’s ascendant beer scene, where innovative brewers and great venues meet• Top 10 Manchester pubsBeer fans will head to Manchester for Cloudwater’s first Friends \u0026amp Family festival, from 1-2 March, which is putting the spotlight on a city where craft-beer tourism is booming. And aside from the festival, each weekend visitors can tour a walkable collection of brew-taps and brewery-owned city-centre bars – and drink some of Britain’s best beer. Here is your essential guide.It is difficult to make an industrial railway arch unit cosy but, near Victoria station, owner Mark Welsbyhas transformed Runaway’s split-level space of pallets and trestle tables into a laid-back nook that’s ideal for lingering – despite the fact you’re drinking from plastic glasses overlooking a working brewery. There is moody lighting, board games, beer skittles, interesting music and a few subtly eccentric decorative flourishes. Eight keg taps are augmented by bottles to drink-intakeaway. Do not miss the Tropical Crush double IPA (DIPA) and the modern Manchester classic, Runaway’s IPA. Made with an unusually dark crystal malt, it is a beer of rare depth. Brewery tours available.• Pint from £4.20, therunawaybreweryA stone’s throw from the traffic of Great Ancoats Street, this brewery tap has a Zen-like calm. Ornamental plants decorate a minimalist, Scandi-style pale-wood interior, while tasteful electronica burbles away discreetly. It is a space as design-conscious as Cloudwater’s artwork large versions of which are displayed on-site. Cloudwater is zealous about freshness and Unit 9’s 20 taps pour beers kegged and served within seven days from a 3C cold-store. Everything is served in set third, half and two-third measures (no pints), which will irk some people – as may the controversial decision to make Unit 9 cashless and card-only. On the upside, the flat £3.50 pricing makes this one of the cheaper places to experience Cloudwater’s exceptional but notoriously expensive beers. Unit 9 also hosts irregular tap-takeovers with similarly cutting-edge breweries (Verdant, Against The Grain).• Beers £3.50, cloudwaterbrew.coA world away from the sometimes oppressive reverence of the geekiest craft bars, Seven Bro7ther’s Ancoats tap is a looser, friendlier, frequently packed proposition. For all its light hipster stylings (a lot of rough-hewn planks and filament lightbulbs), fundamentally this is a big unpretentious boozer, which happens to sell unusually good beer. The tap selection includes guest beers from breweries as erse as 4T’s and Gipsy Hill but naturally the Salford brewery’s beers dominate. Its stout and keg IPA are dependable drops.• Pint from £3.80, sevenbro7hersLess of a destination than when GRUB ran its street-food events here, this newly revamped brewery-tap (out goes communal seating in comes heaters) remains an essential stop-off on any Manchester crawl if only to try Alphabet’s oatmeal-spiked pale ale, A To The K. In the warren of railway arch units around Piccadilly station, the brewery is jazzily decorated with the fever-dream graphic art that designer Nick Hamilton creates for Alphabet’s, at times, equally out-there beers (for example, Carry On Crampus cranberry bock You’re So Vain salted caramel imperial stout). Alphabet has recently gone down the no-pints, card-only route. Two-third schooners are now its largest serve. Over summer, expect music and street food one-offs in the courtyard.• Two-thirds from £2.60, @ABCtaproomUnusually colourful (its orange banquettes and Perspex back-bar give it a look of a 1980s Top of the Pops set), this Dale Street tap-house serves a mix of quality guest beers (Wild Beer, Mikeller, Burning Sky), and Beatnikz’ hop-forward brews, such as I Smash Citra and Generation IPA. The weekday cask ale deals are notable (recently pie ‘n’ a pint £5, MonTues), as is Beatnikz’s ability to bag high-profile guests for its meet-the-brewer events. For instance Arbor Ales and US star Modern Times.• Pint from £3.70, beatnikzrepublicFurnished with old sofas and salvaged fireplace surrounds, this homely take on the railway arch brew-tap has emerged as an affable, community hub for local beer geeks. It’s a little further out into Ardwick, and variously hosts the Manchester branch of the Mikkeller Running Club and irregular events, such as home-brew meets and themed tastings. Owner Steve Dunkley is fascinated by historic and unusual brewing recipes and usually has one gravity-dispensed or barrel-aged curveball on each week. Regulars swear by his Peterloo porter, a dark beer for all seasons.• Pint from £3, beernouveauEach summer, Blackjack Brewery throws open its railway arch doors for a series of brew-taps. On a warm evening, sat under the courtyard’s DIY pergola, eating astonishingly good Neapolitan pizza from Honest Crust, as a range of erting DJs spin, it is one of the city’s best off-piste industrial hideaways. Out of season, you can also drink Blackjack’s beers (timeless hoppy cask pales, such as New Deck, out-there creations like the jasmine tea saison Dragon’s Tears), at its pub, the Smithfield. A stripped-back, low-frills bolthole serving forward-thinking beers, it is perfect.• Pint from £3.80, @TheSmithfieldNQOn Oxford Road, the shipping-container bar and nano-brewery, Öl, is doing arresting things in the realm of wild foraged saisons and milkshake IPAs (@olbrewerybar card-only). Several other Manchester breweries, mainly in Ancoats and Ardwick, also open for sporadic brew-tap events from spring. Keep an eye on Wander Beyond and Manchester Brewing Co, which has “some new big shiny kit going in” it will unveil over the May and August bank holiday weekends. The consistently brilliant Pomona Island Brew Co will open a regular tap at its Salford Quays brewery this summer, as well as throwing its now annual Manchester Beer Week boat party, launching from city-centre bar, Gas Lamp, where Pomona beers are always available (dates tbc)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c99078819bc10fbe90ba8ff705ca1b6739c9cc7c/0_0_5225_3483/master/5225.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dc327f63fc22d6c071f6f46fcf83cdb2 1440w","title":"marie kondo declutter mind time psychology","story":"Along with owning too much stuff, we also pile unreasonable demands on our time. It’s time to limit our focuses“We have taken our wants and been told they are needs,” Joseph Ferrari, the lead author in the DePaul study, recently told the New York Times.This, he says, is why so many of us end up with loads and loads of stuff that doesn’t add value to our lives, the accumulation of which weighs us down and stresses us out.Though the above research, and pop-culture hits like the Netflix show Tidying Up with Marie Kondo, examine physical clutter, I’ve got a strong hunch that psychological clutter may be even worse for your health and performance. The more you’ve got going on at any given time, the less energy and attention you’ll have available for each activity. This is problematic because deep engagement is a precursor to fulfillment and enjoyment – a Harvard study found that people are much happier when they are fully present for the activity that they are doing. A rushed or scattered mind is generally not a happy mind.Busyness may have become a modern badge of honor, but that doesn’t mean it’s good for us. “There’s a global epidemic of overscheduling and it’s ruining our health,” writes Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson in the Johns Hopkins Health Review, citing evidence that when you feel trapped by an unreasonable number of obligations, it’s a quick road to anxiety and hollowness.Better than being chronically busy is to have a limited number of things that you care about and bring your all to them. A wonderful case study is the runner Eliud Kipchoge. As the best marathoner of all time, Kipchoge has countless opportunities to make media appearances and live the life of a celebrity. Yet he prefers a modest lifestyle with a singular focus on running. This, he’s said, makes him happy. “In life, the idea is to be happy,” Kipchoge says in the documentary Breaking2. “So I believe in calm, simple, low-profile life. You live simple, you train hard, and live an honest life. Then you are free.”Decluttering your life doesn’t just improve happiness it improves performance, too. One of the most popular sections in my book Peak Performance is on the notion of being a minimalist to be a maximalist. Nearly all the top performers that my co-author, Steve Magness, and I interviewed for the book were highly selective about how they spent their time and energy. It’s not that they were overly rigid and had no fun. It’s that they only worked on the things that really mattered to them, and they had the confidence to turn down all the things that didn’t – think of it as the Marie Kondo approach applied to your time. “If you want to be really good, if you want to master and thoroughly enjoy one thing, you’ve got to say no to many others,” Michael Joyner, a top researcher at the Mayo Clinic, told us for the book.Decluttering your life may be effective, but that doesn’t make it easy, especially in a world characterized by hyperconnectivity and endless opportunities to do more. The decluttering challenge is universal. Nearly everyone I coach struggles with it. The good news is that a three-step process can help.I go through this process with my coaching clients at least once a year and whenever they are feeling overwhelmed. What’s great is that this same process can be used on more microlevels, too. You could very easily adapt it in the context of your exercise routine or relationships.Remember: more may be more. But that doesn’t mean more is better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d04c6db339fb0d37ba5f81faf0a4ac30d477a553/0_200_5190_3114/master/5190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08ca123988ae5b568fcb38f663f55c41","title":"fbi struggles to attract new recruits","story":"Report says sharp decline in number of applicants continued last year from a peak of 68,500 in 2009 to a mere 11,500 in 2018The FBI is having trouble recruiting new agents, according to a story this week in the Wall Street Journal. A sharp decline in the number of applicants for special agent positions, long considered among the most prestigious in American law enforcement, continued last year the report says, from a peak of 68,500 in 2009 to a mere 11,500 in 2018.“We had a lot of discussion internally about why the number of special agent applicants were fluctuating so much over the years. We were trying to figure out what’s the story,” Peter Sursi, the man in charge of recruitment for the FBI told the Journal.According to the FBI, the number of already employed special agents has also dropped somewhat over the last few years, from 14,050 in 2014 to 13,906 in 2017.At first blush it might seem that a certain polarizing political figure disparaging the honor and the trustworthiness of the FBI on TV and on Twitter every day might play a role in lowered enthusiasm. From special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia, which Donald Trump has frequently called a witch hunt, to his spats with former FBI acting director Andrew McCabe and others, scarcely a week goes by without his impugning the law enforcement agency in some way or another.It does seem that under the Trump administration, positive impressions of the FBI, at least among Republicans – perhaps the law and order types you might consider drawn to such work – have in fact dropped.But the decrease in applications began long before Trump was president, the FBI says. They think the problem is economics not politics.“Our recruiters never had to actively encourage special agent applicants to apply before,” Sursi told the Journal. “But the labor market is tight for most employers these days, with more jobs than qualified workers. We have to adjust our strategies to be a competitive option.”The FBI aren’t alone in this, however. The Army, Navy and other military branches have seen recruitment shortages, according to the New York Times and the Army Times.Police forces around the country have also had trouble recruiting of late. The total number of full-time sworn officers has dropped 23,000 since 2013 to about 700,000 according to NPR, who called the officer shortage “a quiet crisis in American policing”.Among the factors most of these reports cite are a booming job market and strong economy. If people can find interesting and decently-paying work elsewhere, it may just be the case that all of the potential unknowns that come with a career in law enforcement no longer seem worth it. Terry Albury, a 17-year FBI veteran, was sentenced to jail last year after leaking internal documents that unveiled how the agency used racial profiling in counter-terror investigations. In 2017, Al Jazeera reported on documents from the FBI that had been monitoring Black Lives Matter activists. In 2016, a variety of groups demanded Congress investigate the FBI’s spying on activists of all kinds, from anti-pipeline protestors to Occupy Wall Street.The ACLU has begun reporting on the FBI’s racial and ethnic “mapping” of American communities.“Nationwide, the FBI is gathering reports on innocent Americans’ so-called ‘suspicious activity’ and sharing it with unknown numbers of federal, state and local government agencies,” the report says.It may be that an increasing number of Americans are fed up with this type of surveillance. We may occasionally, jokingly, take solace in the presence of our own federal agent looking out for us when we’re lonely – but that doesn’t mean most of us want to be the ones doing the dirty work."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3807303.1551274586!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cost of 2 7km dublin cycle path jumps to 20m","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA redesign of the scheme plus the construction of a link through Fairview Park, and the requirement to fit in with the BusConnects corridor from Clongriffin to the city centre, has resulted in the inflated cost. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe cost of installing a new 2.7km “Dutch style” cycle path from Fairview to Amiens Street in Dublin’s north inner city has almost tripled to €20 million, according to Dublin City Council documents.Councillors in October 2017 approved plans for the segregated cycle route which will connect the city centre with the Dublin Bay cycle path that runs along the coast from Clontarf to Sutton.The route, which would start at the Alfie Byrne Road north of Fairview Park and continue on each side of the road past the Talbot Street junction on Amiens Street, had at that time, been expected to cost €7 million. However, documents issued by the council this week for the construction of the route have set the cost of the project at €20 million.A redesign of the scheme since it was approved by councillors, the construction of a link through Fairview Park, and the requirement to fit in with the BusConnects core bus corridor route from Clongriffin to the city centre, has resulted in the inflated cost.The cycle route was first proposed six years ago as a two-way track running on the east side of the road only. However, in 2015, the council’s traffic department said this would not be feasible and instead, it drew up plans for paths on both sides of the road. Felling of 50 treesThe new plans published two years ago, involved the felling of 50 trees in Fairview Park, some of which are more than 100 years old. More than 15,000 people signed an online petition seeking the retention of the trees, some of which were planted in 1908 by nationalist and unionist communities as part of international Arbour Day celebrations.The council subsequently amended its plans to save 42 of the trees, this required the removal of part of the inbound traffic lane running in front of Fairview Park.On approving the scheme councillors ordered further design work be undertaken to achieve better segregation between cyclists, buses, and general traffic, and improved safety for pedestrians. Bus corridorsTo accommodate the enhanced bus corridors, each bus stop will have a “passenger island” with a segregated lane for cyclists to travel behind the stop. Road junctions will be designed in the Dutch style where cyclists and pedestrians are separated from and given priority from traffic.The cycle paths will be two-metres wide and protected by kerbs, and in some places separated from the roadway by trees or parked cars. The project will include the development of a link through Fairview Park along the river Tolka, between North Strand Road and Alfie Byrne Road. The work, which will include the upgrade and reconfiguration of signalised junctions, the installation of toucan crossings, CCTV and lighting, landscaping and utility ersion works, is due to start this year and take two years to complete."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3807985.1551254634!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit political movement in westminister as clock ticks down","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May told the House of Commons that any Brexit delay would be shortAlmost on the eve of the very last month we have had political movement in Westminster.

My question is that, given the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation,” Mr Khan said during a brief televised broadcast to the nation. “We should sit down and talk.”India’s attack on Tuesday targeted the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), the group that claimed credit for the suicide attack. India said a large number of JeM fighters had been killed, but Pakistani officials said the strike was a failure and inflicted no casualties.Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, and went to the brink a fourth in 2002 after a Pakistani militant attack on India’s parliament.The latest escalation marks a sudden turnaround in relations between the two countries, which both claim Kashmir in full but rule it in part. As recently as November,Mr Khan spoke of “mending ties” with India.The conflict also comes at a critical time for Indian prime minster Narendra Modi, who faces a general election before the end of May.Mr Modi’s decision to order air strikes could benefit him politically, according to analysts and pollsters, but he was accused on Wednesday by opposition parties of capitalising on conflict.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticised the “blatant politicisation of the sacrifices made by our armed forces”, in a joint statement by 21 opposition parties, the first time they have broken ranks with the government over the issue.Calls for restraintUS secretary of state Mike Pompeo spoke separately with the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan and urged them to avoid “further military activity” following Tuesday’s air strike. “I expressed to both ministers that we encourage India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, and avoid escalation at any cost,” Mr Pompeo said in a statement on Wednesday. “I also encouraged both ministers to prioritize direct communication and avoid further military activity,” he said.Both China and the European Union have also called for restraint.Many of the facts in the latest series of engagements are disputed by the two sides.Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor, spokesman for the Pakistan armed forces, said two Indian jets had been shot down after they entered Pakistani airspace while responding to a Pakistani aerial mission on targets in Indian-controlled Kashmir.One of the jets crashed on the Indian-controlled side of the de facto border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control, and the other on the Pakistani side and two Indian pilots had been captured, he said.Maj Gen Ghafoor said the Pakistani aircraft had carried out the strikes in response to India’s air strike the day before but had taken deliberate action to ensure no casualties were caused.The Pakistani jets had locked on to six targets, in a demonstration of their capacity to hit strategic installations, but deliberately fired into open spaces where there would be no casualties.“This was not a retaliation in true sense, but to tell Pakistan has capability, we can do it, but we want to be responsible, we don’t want an escalation, we don’t want a war,” Maj Gen Ghafoor told a news conference.One of the aircraft fell on India’s side of Kashmir, while the second came down in Pakistani-held territory with two pilots captured, he added.Different accountRaveesh Kumar, a spokesman for India’s foreign ministry, gave a different account, telling a news briefing that the Pakistan air strikes on military targets had been “foiled”.India shot down one Pakistani plane that landed in Pakistani territory, and it lost one of its own planes, not two, with the pilot “missing in action”, Mr Kumar said. “Pakistan has claimed that he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts.” Pakistan denies it lost a plane in the encounter.At the Pakistani briefing, Maj gen Ghafoor produced photographs of weapons and identity documents he said were carried by Indian pilots.The Pakistan government’s official Twitter account released a video of what it claimed was one of the Indian pilots who had been shot down.The man, whose face was bloodied and blindfolded, gave his name and service number, before telling a man questioning him: “I’m sorry sir, that’s all I’m supposed to tell you.”The Indian air force has ordered Kashmir’s main airport in Srinagar along with at least three others in neighbouring states to close, an official said.Pakistan shut its airspace, with commercial flights in the country cancelled. Flights from the Middle East and India were also affected.In a separate incident, police officials in Indian-occupied Kashmir said that four passengers and a civilian had died after an Indian aircraft crashed in Kashmir. The craft was initially reported by officials to be an aeroplane, but a partial tail number from the craft seen by a Reuters witness showed it to be an Mi17 military helicopter.The cause of the crash was unknown.Artillery fireThe aerial engagement followed overnight artillery fire by both sides. Pakistan used heavy calibre weapons in 12 to 15 places along the Line of Control, a spokesman for the Indian defence forces said on Wednesday.“The Indian army retaliated for effect and our focused fire resulted in severe destruction to five posts and number of casualties,” the spokesman said. Five Indian soldiers suffered minor wounds in the shelling that ended on Wednesday morning, he added.Officials on the Pakistani side said at least four people had been killed and seven wounded, including civilians, with thousands evacuated and schools closed in border areas.“Only those families are still here which have concrete bunkers built within or along their homes,” said Muhammad Din, a resident of Chakothi, a village in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir near the de facto border.India has also continued its crackdown on suspected militants operating in Kashmir, and on Wednesday security forces killed two Jaish militants in a gun battle, Indian police said.Syed Maqsood, the superintendent of a government hospital in Indian-occupied Kashmir, said that all hospitals in the region had been asked to paint a red cross on their roofs in case of further Pakistani air strikes.The latest exchanges hit stock markets in both countries.Pakistani stocks fell sharply during morning trade with the benchmark KSE 100 Index index down 3.34 percent and the narrower KMI 30 index down 3.6 percent in Karachi.The Indian stock market was down around 0.5 percent, but the nervousness was evident in Mumbai. There was a visible increase in security levels in India’s financial capital, which has suffered numerous militant attacks in the past. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

But we\u0027re going to keep asking questions, he added, walking through Caracas airport.Ramos was detained beneath Miraflores presidential palace late on Monday night, after a televised interview with Mr Maduro took a turn for the worse.Ramos, a household name in Latin America, was 17 minutes into the interview when he showed Mr Maduro footage of young Venezuelan men in Caracas following a bin lorry, rifling through the rubbish as it was thrown into the back and eating the filthy scraps of food they found.“He didn’t like the things we were asking him about the lack of democracy in Venezuela, the torture and the political prisoners,” said Ramos.Soldiers unleash tear gas during trouble at Venezuela border, in picturesHe said he and his team were held for more than two hours, and their equipment confiscated – including their phones and memory cards.“We don’t have anything,” he said. “They confiscated the interviews.”Venezuela’s communications minister did not deny that Ramos was held, but blamed the reporter for staging “a cheap show” which he said was directed by the US state department.He added: “Hundreds of journalists have come through, who have received the decent treatment that we always give to those who do journalistic work.”Short detentions and deportations have become common, especially as reporters facing delays for official permissions seek shortcuts to report in Venezuela.This has come into the spotlight over the past month as Mr Maduro faces his biggest political challenge since he replaced Hugo Chavez six years ago, with dozens of countries recognising his rival Juan Guaido as the country\u0027s legitimate leader.Venezuelan children, who attend school on the Colombian side of the border, have been blocked from class after the border between both countries was closed At least seven foreign journalists who flew in to cover the turmoil were briefly detained in January.A group of MEPs were also turned back at the airport, with the Venezuelan government claiming they came to Venezuela with suspicious intent.Mr Guaido was on Tuesday still in Bogota, having left the country ahead of the planned delivery of humanitarian aid on Saturday. It was unclear when, or how, he would return, given that Mr Maduro banned him from entering the country.The aid delivery ended in fiasco as the convoys were blocked, a truck of supplies was burnt, four died and 300 were injured in violent skirmishes between Venezuelan troops and Mr Guaido’s supporters.A Colombian police officer in Cucuta, Colombia, looks across the border at Venezuelan security forces Mr Maduro says that the aid convoy was an excuse for US military intervention.“They are trying to fabricate a crisis to justify political escalation and a military intervention in Venezuela to bring a war to South America,” he said, speaking to ABC news in his first interview with a US network in many years.The extremist Ku Klux Klan government that Donald Trump directs wants a war over oil, and more than just oil.Jorge Arreaza, Venezuela\u0027s foreign minister, was in New York on Tuesday night for a meeting of the UN Security Council on Venezuela. The US wants the Council to vote this week on a draft resolution calling for elections and the delivery of aid, but Russia and China would block such a resolution.Mr Arreaza told the Security Council that the US-led campaign to oust Mr Maduro had failed.That was the last chapter in the coup on Saturday, he said. Read my lips - it failed. Now is the time for us to return to sanity.Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s ambassador to the UN, supported Mr Arreaza and questioned what other countries would have done if confronted with an attempted illegal state border crossing for the delivery of unknown cargo.Turning to the US, he pointedly noted: One country even wants to build a huge wall on the border of another country to prevent an illegal border crossing.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Jacob Rees-Mogg says he could vote for Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal\u0026#39Anti-vaxxers\u0026#39 must not be given credence, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock Chinese Communist Party warns members to put faith in Marx not \u0026#39ghosts and spirits\u0026#39Famed Brighton Belle could return to railway with a few modern twists after £6m restoration project led by team of enthusiastsJihadi bride Shamima Begum\u0026#39s British baby could return to UK, suggests Sajid JavidComment: Theresa May has sparked the beginning of the end for the Conservative partySurrey earthquake causes residents to call police claiming a plane had crashedSaddleworth Moor fire: \u0026#39Apocalyptic\u0026#39 blaze breaks out in Yorkshire after Britain\u0026#39s hottest ever winter dayCairo station fire: Train crash causes blaze which kills and injures dozensComment: After two Brexit climbdowns, will we ever trust our politicians to tell the truth again?World\u0026#39s smallest baby boy sent home after months in Tokyo hospitalDonald Trump meets Kim Jong-un at Vietnam summit and praises North Korea\u0026#39s \u0026#39unlimited\u0026#39 potentialGame of Thrones: How the Wall was built, and what its destruction meansDuke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive in Northern Ireland Game of Thrones: How the Wall was built, and what its destruction meansPakistan and India need help climbing down, or risk another war over KashmirMichael Cohen claims that Donald Trump \u0026#39said black people were too stupid to vote for him\u0026#39Sally Challen appeals charge arguing new law means she is not guilty of murdering husband Five men stabbed, one fatally, as a wave of violence sweeps LondonWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/27/TELEMMGLPICT000189847157_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdEKusUCeKq9VS5XNTYK1PFeIlzld9KeYzVpi2Y2onXY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"famed brighton belle could return railwaywith modern twists","story":"The Brighton Belle train has been restored over the last 10 yearsIts plush seats were once graced by the likes of Sir Laurence Olivier and even the Queen, but decades have passed since the Brighton Belle last brought splendour to Britain’s railways.Now, the celebrated London-to-Brighton train could be about to return after a team of enthusiasts raised £6 million to restore it to its former glory - with a few modern twists.Four of the original carriages, which have been out of service since 1972, are being pampered for an expected return to the rails in 2020, offering passengers silver service for trips to the coast.However, modern realities - uncomfortable as they may be - have also had to be taken into account, with seats widened from 19ins to 22ins to accommodate today’s plumper passenger.Similarly designers have been forced to remove one of the four upholstered seats on either side of the aisle to widen walking space by 7ins since the Belle\u0027s 1950s heyday.Gordon Rushton, a trustee of the 5BEL Trust, which has carried out the work, said: If we had four seats across the carriage there wouldn\u0027t be enough room for people to eat comfortably.Also the standard British posterior has expanded somewhat over the last 40 years so that has been a factor in the seating change as well.Silver service will be on offer for Brighton Belle passengersOther contemporary touches will be peppered throughout the Art Deco interior, including heaters and USB ports beneath the mahogany wooden tables.The four all-electric carriages have a capacity for 100 people and are now fully operational. Two further carriages are still undergoing restoration.The 90mph trains will make pleasure journeys from London Victoria to the Sussex and Kent seaside, serving three-course meals along the way.Mr Rushton continued: The quality of the accommodation puts today\u0027s first class carriages in the shade, with each car inidually designed by a different leading British design house.It was - and will be again - the leading icon of the Art Deco period.”The Brighton Belle embarked on its first journey in 1933 and was once the pride of the Southern Railway fleet, ferrying the great and good to the coast for many decades.Sir Laurence, one of the country\u0027s most revered actors, was so fond of the service running between London Victoria and Brighton that he led a protest in 1970 when he found out the signature dish of kippers was no longer on the menu.Two of the carriages before work beganTwo of the 14 original carriages were found by volunteers rusting in a derelict railway shed near Brighton station, covered in graffiti and pigeon droppings, before the restoration.The work has been funded by several wealthy benefactors who are train enthusiasts.Mr Rushton said: Our aim is to have this wonderful train running on the mainline for many years so that future generations can enjoy an authentic 1930s travel experience.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Jacob

There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 315 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 515 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 615 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 915 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1415 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall said: “BritBox\u0026nbspwill be the home for the best of British creativity – celebrating the best of the past, the best of today and investing in new British originated content in the future.”BBC Director-General Tony Hall said: “A new streaming service delivering the best home-grown content to the public who love it best... It’s an exciting time for the viewing public.”The move marks further another collaboration between the two rivals. Last year, ITV produced the series Bodyguard, which ended up being released by\u0026nbspthe BBC. They have also worked together on a US version of BritBox, a subscription to which costs $6.99 (£5.26). The broadcasters said they have enjoyed success with the US version, which has surpassed half a million subscribers.The latest group of Celebrity Apprentice candidates have been revealedBBC invites public to take control of its Brexit coverageBBC accused of sexism for describing Oscar-nominee as ‘mum’Little else is known about the UK version of Britbox, which\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbsplaunch in the second half of this year. Whether BBC produced shows will leave Netflix\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspwhich currently hosts seasons of\u0026nbspPeaky Blinders, Sherlock and Luther – remains to be seen.The BBC last year admitted they were struggling to keep hold of younger audiences, with more people turning to subscription services than ever before. Reports emerged that\u0026nbsp16 to 24-year-olds spent more time watching Netflix than all BBC TV services together, including iPlayer. At the time, a spokesperson said they were looking to change the structure of iPlayer.“As the trend shifts towards on-demand viewing, the BBC risks being overtaken by competitors,” the BBC said at the time. “Maintaining the reach and time that audiences spend with our output is … difficult when they have so many other choices at their disposal. This challenge is most acute for young audiences.”ITV likewise reported difficulties combatting the rise of Netflix. Reports first suggested in July 2018 that they were considering working with the BBC and Channel 4 to create a new streaming service.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Critics of the streaming service have\u0026nbspno cause to feel schadenfreude at it missing out on the biggest prize.\u0026nbspThose opponents\u0026nbsphave stirred a heated debate about the film’s status,\u0026nbspmost recently in the context of\u0026nbspthe Baftas where Roma did (deservedly) win best film.\u0026nbspThe boss of Vue Cinemas, one of the UK’s biggest chains, wrote a furious open letter to Bafta chief Amanda Berry in response to Roma’s presence in the lists, threatening to pull the firm’s support from the annual shindig.Created with Sketch.Biggest talking points of the Oscars Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Lafy Gaga and Bradley Cooper perform \u0027Shallow\u0027A Star is Born actors Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper performed their Oscar-winning song “Shallow” at this year’s Oscars ceremony and set social media alight.Best Actor winner Rami Malek caused concern when he fell off stage after accepting his award.

The latter arrived with the announcement that Green Book had beaten out the category’s frontrunner, Roma, to Best Picture. It was a dismal reminder that progress is a slow, tedious process.

Given the adorable viral video he posted in reaction to the nod, the countless selfies with every Hollywood actor he comes across, and the interviews in which he’s grinning ear to ear, it’s clear Grant decided to grab the opportunity with both hands.Tim Richards derisively described the film as a “made for TV movie” on account of its limited cinematic release.\u0026nbspHe said that it was still unclear\u0026nbspwhether Roma was screened on more than 13 UK screens at the art house Curzon Cinema chain, “representing less than 0.5 per cent of the cinema market” and for a week at the Filmhouse in Edinburgh.Richards went on to point to Bafta’s rules stating that: “Films should not be screened purely to qualify them for these awards, and the film committee may not accept entries if they do not deem the theatrical release to be meaningful.Bafta decided Curzon’s screens made it meaningful enough.\u0026nbspI was raised by domestic servants like the one in RomaThe controversy is far from unique to the UK. AMC Cinemas and Regal, two major US chains, refused to play Roma as part of their best picture Oscar showcases and didn’t participate in its very limited US theatrical run because of the short window available before Netflix subscribers got their hands on it. Even the offer of cheap rentals couldn’t entice them.\u0026nbspMexico, the film’s home market, was not immune either. Cuarón went so far as to tweet his disappointment that it was showing on more screens in Poland than his native land as a result of big chains saying no.\u0026nbspBut are cinema operators right to draw a global line in the sand over the “theatrical window”\u0026nbspthat Richards says “has successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades and is one of the core differentiators that makes cinema unique”?How about asking yourself this: how many subtitled films\u0026nbspwould you normally expect to see at your local multiplex, regardless of how good they are?\u0026nbspAlfonso Cuaron wins Best Director for RomaArthouse cinemas are mostly where they live. Roma is different chiefly because it has an A-list Hollywood director and a distributor with enough cash to give\u0026nbspit an Oscar campaign.Awards films don’t always get much of a run even when\u0026nbspthey’re in English. My local multiplex, for example, supported If Beale Street Could Talk\u0026nbspwith just one of its 14 screens for barely a week.\u0026nbspThe fact that I was able to catch it was greatly assisted by my having booked time off during that week.\u0026nbspRoma, by contrast, didn’t involve my jumping through any of the hoops families usually have to jump through when the parents want to see the sort of film they can’t take the kids along to. It was there, at my convenience, and it has remained in my head ever since.\u0026nbspIt’s the sort of film that does that.At the core of this controversy is a clash of business models, with Netflix’s desire to give its subscribers what it has paid for as soon as possible, clashing with the big chains’ demand for their cherished period of exclusivity.\u0026nbspBaftasAs ever, in these situations, the customer ultimately loses. I would still like to see Roma on a large screen and I would make the effort to do so, even after viewing it at home. The experience would be worth it.\u0026nbspRichards may be right to take shots at Netflix for scarcely making previous releases available for any sort of cinematic run at all, regardless of the window.\u0026nbspBut as regards the “window”\u0026nbspas a concept and the terms on which Roma was released, he’s on shakier ground. Note how he says the window has “successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades”. The problem is with that “many decades”. Things change.\u0026nbspSteven Spielberg takes thinly veiled shots at streaming servicesDespite people repeatedly calling its doom, the silver screen has adapted to a lot of changes, a bewildering array of them. It has weathered the emergence of TV, the widespread purchase\u0026nbspof home entertainment systems, video gaming, the internet, the explosion of choice in people’s leisure options.\u0026nbspIt can survive Netflix too, and cinemas’ rising global gross revenues\u0026nbspsuggests they are doing just that. I’d be willing to put money on their surviving shorter exclusivity windows for Netflix or for other films too.\u0026nbspThe latter’s customers, as a rule, tend to go to the cinema more than non-subscribers do anyway. They like movies. If they’re like me, they’ll often watch them more than once. But the first preference will always be to see them on the big screen, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s Roma or Captain Marvel, about which my daughter and I are positively breathless in anticipation.\u0026nbspThe cinema offers an experience that Netflix cannot, and that is worth paying extra for.\u0026nbspThe disruptive threat Netflix poses is being felt much more by traditional television operators than it is by movie theatre chains.\u0026nbspNetflix needs to change its tune too though. It should be more open to giving more of its properties a cinematic release as Amazon, which admittedly has a rather different business model, has done very successfully.\u0026nbspSurely the various sides in this debate ought to be be capable of reaching a compromise? It should to be in their interests to do so. It would certainly be in the interests of movie lovers and movie goers and, well, art.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.Most of the jobs created in the UK since the financial crisis have been in low-paid, low-skilled sectors such as bars, social work and warehouses.As wages have stagnated, it has been cheaper and less risky to take on extra staff than investing money in machinery, training or research and development. It’s relatively easy to get rid of workers, less so to recoup millions spent on a new high-tech warehouse you no longer need.Some firms have dispensed even with the risk of hiring staff by claiming that those staff are merely self-employed workers connected to customers by a technology platform.Firms leaving the UK, downsizing or cutting jobs ahead of BrexitWorkers have done less well out of this situation. Poor wage growth and freezes to benefits have sent in-work poverty sharply upwards.The average real wage is still £500 below its pre-crisis peak and the number of children living in poverty is on track to reach a record high by 2023-4, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank.Yes they are. In the year to December, average earnings rose at their fastest pace in a decade. Surely proof that the Brexit doommongers are wrong?Not really. While nominal wage growth is rising fast, this doesn’t take account of the rising cost of living.When we factor in inflation, wages rose by a relatively modest 1.2 per cent over the year which is some way below the long-run average and less than pace when the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016.They are now beginning to rise not because the economy is faring particularly well but because the pool of cheap available labour is running out.\u0026nbspOne factor that may be affecting this is a reduction in net migration.There is no real evidence for that.As Tom Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics explains: “In theory, higher levels of net migration should increase the supply of labour, putting downward pressure on wages.\u0026nbsp“But more net migration also increases demand for goods and services which puts upward pressure on wages.”In reality, most studies agree that these two factors more or less offset each other.A sharp drop in the available workforce would be expected to boost wages, but only in the short term, says Jonathan Portes, professor of economics at King’s College in London.“In the long-term you can’t pay yourself more than you earn.”Ultimately wages can only rise sustainably if workers are more productive - if they make more goods and services for each hour they work.Car industry workers want to leave the EUBut productivity in the UK is actually declining, according to the latest official figures. In part this is due to the fact that companies are holding off on investment because of Brexit uncertainty.This effect may subside if uncertainty comes to an end but the fact remains that outside the EU, Britain is a considerably less attractive prospect for many firms looking to invest.The decline in available labour could also lead to mismatches between skills available and job vacancies. We have already seen this situation in the NHS for example, which for a variety of reasons now has a very large number of vacancies.\u0026nbspSuch mismatches would also be expected to drag on productivity as people end up in roles they aren’t particularly good at or well-trained for.Meanwhile, some of the world’s most productive companies - Nissan, Honda, Toyota, Airbus - are at various stages of implementing plans to cut thousands of UK jobs. Brexit is not the only factor at play here but it is certainly a key one.Most of those companies have held off making such decisions for as long as possible. To move staff, offices and factories can be expensive. But with uncertainty dragging on, the point where those decisions become economically rational has now arrived for many firms and that certainly will not be good for British workers.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Many of M\u0026ampS\u0027 customers\u0026nbspthat want online grocery shopping\u0026nbspare already Ocado customers, he says.“It may have overestimated the lure of M\u0026ampS products, and indeed the questionable benefits of being able to order an M\u0026ampS dress with a weekly shop.”\u0026nbspThe new tie-up can be a success but only if M\u0026ampS sticks to the premium products it’s famous for like, says George Lawrie, principal analyst at market research firm Forrester.“In other words, it will work for Champagne, fresh oysters, canapes and caviar, but not for things like cling film and carrots,” he says. This marries with Ocado’s vision of a premium delivery experience, with smartly dressed drivers delivering your groceries straight to your kitchen table.Luxury deliveries work better because of cost, Lawrie explains.“Normally you’d expect picking, packing and transporting produce to amount to around 25-30 per cent of the cost of a single item, a cost that high margin retailers can absorb but low margin grocery cannot – unless everything is highly automated.”M\u0026ampS clearly can’t compete with the big supermarkets when it comes to customers\u0027 weekly shops, says Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management, which holds shares in M\u0026ampS.He is also pessimistic about the deal, describing the £600m M\u0026ampS is raising to pay for the new venture as an “extravagant use of shareholders\u0027 money”.“The motivations behind this deal for M\u0026ampS are clear, as the company has long struggled with an online offering that is not up to scratch.”The benefits to M\u0026ampS of an online food shopping are not certain because of the limited range of products it stocks, says Mumford. Consumers see it as a place to top up their weekly food shop with premium items, rather than somewhere for a large weekly shop.But that’s not so much a problem as it might once have been because Ocado has become less dependent on Waitrose products and now stocks broad range of own-brand and private label products, says Stephen Lienert, senior analyst at Jefferies.“Ocado therefore goes full circle: whereas before people used Ocado to access Waitrose products, now the supermarkets want to use Ocado.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This comes after Conservative MP Anna Soubry was verbally abused and called \u0027Nazi scum\u0027 by pro-Brexit protesters on 7 January“I have written to Grant Thornton, Wonga’s administrators, to understand how they intend to progress outstanding complaints against Wonga.“If Wonga continues to damage people’s finances from beyond the grave, it may be time for the government to intervene.”Caroline Wayman, chief ombudsman at the FOS, told the Treasury Committee last month that customers who had open complaints will not be able to have their issues resolved.The customers, many of whom are considered vulnerable consumers, are also unable to obtain redress through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)\u0026nbspbecause high-cost credit firms like Wonga are not covered.The firm went bust after struggling to adapt to new affordability rules, a cap on total credit charges and an increasing number of complaints from borrowers.Many of the complaints stem 2014 rules which tightened affordability criteria that payday lenders have to apply to prospective borrowers.\u0026nbspWhen a company is still solvent, customers sold loans that they\u0026nbspwere unable\u0026nbspto afford can complain to the FOS to get their money back, including interest, charges and further compensation.But Ms Morgan expressed the committee’s concern that Wonga’s former customers, many of whom are likely to be vulnerable, may be at a significant financial disadvantage as they are no longer eligible to claim through the FOS nor are eligible for compensation through FSCS.In 2014 Wonga introduced a new management team and wrote off £220m of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The idea is to give people back control of their data and end the exploitation and monetisation of people\u0027s private lives by the likes of Facebook and Google.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHTC describes its Exodus 1 as the first smartphone built for this new internet and it is the brainchild of Phil Chen, the appropriately-titled \u0027decentralized chief officer\u0027 of the Taiwanese firm.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re this far into the information age and there\u0027s barely any conversation about digital property, Chen tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspAll of our private data – from credit history to search data – is handled by third parties. We don\u0027t own or control any of it. Instead, it is just seven companies in the world that control almost all of the data. They have become more powerful than governments.The way to get the power back, Chen says, is to introduce a paradigm shift to the big data business models of these large tech companies, from the apps we use, to the way we pay.\u0026nbspThese blockchain phones operate on the same underlying technology that supports bitcoin, so it is no surprise that cryptocurrencies form a key role in their operation.At MWC, HTC is also introducing a new range of decentralised apps – or\u0026nbspdApps\u0026nbsp– that do not share or send data back to a centralised company or server. Some apps even allow people to monetise their own data, by selling it for cryptocurrency.Payments can also go the other way, meaning users can make micropayments directly to websites and content creators without the need for transaction fees.\u0026nbspEven the phone\u0027s default browser, Opera, supports\u0026nbspsuch functionality, describing itself as the world\u0027s first crypto-ready browser.We are at the dawn of a new generation of the Web, one where new decentralized services will challenge the status quo, says Charles Hamel, head of crypto at Opera.\u0026nbspHTC and Opera have both made the bold decision to be the first to step up and enable this transformation.ethereum (HTC)Like other blockchain phones, such as the Sirin\u0026nbspFinney, the HTC Exodus 1 comes with an in-built cryptocurrency wallet that can store private keys for\u0026nbspbitcoin, ether and litecoin\u0026nbspoffline. By not being connected to the internet, this cold-storage wallet protects the funds from hacking, as well as a person\u0027s private data.Until now, the HTC Exodus has only been available to buy in cryptocurrency\u0026nbspbut from March people will be able to purchase it using traditional fiat currency, with the eventual hope that the phone and the decentralised web will make it into the mainstream.I don\u0027t like calling it a blockchain phone because it\u0027s not just for crypto geeks, Chen says. It\u0027s about the internet.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearIt\u0027s been 10 years since the birth of bitcoin and blockchain technology but the industry is still very much in its infancy.Interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain has been in decline ever since bitcoin\u0027s dramatic price crash, which saw the cryptocurrency lose more than three quarters of its value in 2018.Bitcoin price predictions for 2019: From $0 to $36,000, experts weigh Online analytics show Google searches for both terms have been in free-fall during that time, and according to Gartner, the technology entered the so-called \u0027trough of disillusionment\u0027 phase in its 2018\u0026nbspHype Cycle for Emerging Technologies\u0026nbspreport.The leading market research firm says it may be another 10 years before it reaches the \u0027plateau of productivity\u0027 and begins to see widespread adoption.For this to happen, Chen says, it will likely involve the very tech giants that this technology poses a threat to. Their considerable reach means their adoption of such technology would automatically push it into the mainstream. Another scenario would be that continued data breaches propel\u0026nbspthe conversation of digital property into the spotlight.People are becoming more aware of their data and will realise this is part of the solution, he says. This could spread like wildfire. The tech giants may try to quell its spread, but ultimately they may have to choose between fuelling it or getting burnt and left behind.The HTC Exodus 1 and Sirin\u0026nbspFinney\u0026nbspmay be the first, but blockchain technology is already seeping into more mainstream devices. Earlier this month, Samsung announced its flagship Galaxy S10 range of smartphones, which came with a Blockchain Keystore.There are also rumours that Facebook is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency, which could facilitate payments across its range of messaging apps – from WhatsApp to Messenger. With close to 2 billion users worldwide, such a move could create a currency to rival the dominance of the\u0026nbspUS dollar almost overnight.In a recent interview with Harvard Law professor Jonathan Zittrain, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg explained how blockchain-based authentication could make the social network more secure. But he added: I\u0026nbsphaven\u0027t figured out a way to make this work out.With the technological and financial resources at his disposal, it may just be that Zuckerberg simply hasn\u0027t figured out a way to implement the technology in a way that Facebook can still claim ownership\u0026nbspto it.blockcain smartphones (HTC)The open, decentralised and borderless nature of blockchain\u0026nbspis the reason blockchain remains the only technology vertical not dominated by the incumbents of the industry – it is antithetical to their current business model. The likes of Amazon and Google are leading the way in everything from fintech\u0026nbspto artificial intelligence, as these are all technologies they can control and own.The two largest smartphone makers, Samsung and Huawei, both profit from personal data through their cloud storage businesses. It could therefore fall to Apple to create that spark.Tim Cook keeps talking about privacy but can he take the next step? I\u0027m hopeful and I would be their first cheerleader if they did, Chen says.\u0026nbspThis is a big, giant leap, but we are a David among Goliaths. It will take a giant company to start reversing this tide.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, as Jo Lamiri discovers, they are still buoyant – thanks to a charity giving them a platform for changeClick to followThe IndependentThe 10\u0026nbspor so fishermen I spoke to in Lyme Bay – that breathtakingly beautiful arc of unspoilt coastline between Portland Bill and Start Point that straddles Dorset and Devon – all told the same story. Fishing is in their blood, otherwise they wouldn’t do it. But they are, to a man, concerned about the future of fishing, choked like detritus in a net by the Brussels-imposed bureaucracy of the Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp Rural Affairs (Defra) and the looming uncertainty of Brexit.These are the guys who take their “under-10s”\u0026nbsp(boats less than 10 metres) out to fish for crab, lobster, bass, cod and skate (ray) from West Bay, Lyme Regis, Beer and Axmouth – just as their fathers and grandfathers did before them. Yet these small boats still have to comply with quotas set for the big trawlers that scoop up all marine life in their wake, leaving the seabed smooth and devoid of its natural ecosystems.UK fishermen will have to ‘show catches to EU under no-deal Brexit’Harbourmaster at Axmouth, Angus Walker says: “There are about 600 registered boats from big companies that get 96 per cent\u0026nbspof the quota, leaving 3,000 independents in England with 4 per cent\u0026nbsp– it’s ludicrous. In the Channel we have zero rating this month and last month for cod so we can’t catch any, yet there is loads in the sea. We’ve got to come up with a better system.”Of course, no one knows what will happen post-Brexit. But there are rumours that tariffs of up to 8 per cent\u0026nbspcould be imposed on lobster and crab environment secretary Michael Gove is asserting that no foreign boats will be allowed within six to 12 miles of the UK coast and that the UK will become an “independent coastal state”, taking control of its waters up to 200 miles.“We will take back control of our territorial waters, and for the first time in 50 years, we will be able to grant fishing access for other countries on our terms,” adds Defra. “We will allocate quotas on the basis of what is scientifically sustainable, making sure we have a healthy marine environment and profitable fishing industry.”The fishermen remain cynical over such political promises. Dave Sales – now in his 80s – is still lifting pots over the side of his small boat, Shelley Marie. A direct, no-nonsense man, he is a big fish in the industry (pardon the pun), dropping environment secretary Michael Gove into conversation and consulting with fishing committees around the country. “I started fishing crab and lobster in Lyme Bay in 1957, and I’ve been in West Bay 37 years. When it comes to quota, the problem is that the government doesn’t care two hoots about the small man, but we still have to abide by the rules and regulations.“There’s one word that describes the fishing industry and that’s ‘greed’. There are so many small boats fishing out of Lyme now that in a couple of years there won’t be any fish left. They’re all using miles and miles of net. I look back and think ‘thank goodness I’ve had my day’.”Angus agrees with Dave’s views on the government: “With a pen, in an office, the attitude of Defra has done more damage in the past decade than fishermen have done in the past 1000 years. They focus too much on single species. The guy from the MMO (Marine Management Organisation) regularly comes down here and has a coffee with us to talk about the issues we’re facing, but I can’t remember the last time I saw someone from Defra.”Many of the fisherman I spoke to felt quotas should be axed for small boats. West Bay fisherman Jamie Smith says: “There’s only so much you can do and the weather restricts us. The big boats threaten our livelihoods, as well as those of the boat builders, fuel suppliers and gear suppliers.” Matt takes a similar view. “They may say it’s done for conservation issues, but to me the biggest conservation issue is the weather. If we can’t go out, we can’t catch the fish. If you’re looking to conserve the fish, start with reserves and the right method of fishing.”There’s one word that describes the fishing industry and that’s ‘greed’Quotas aren’t the only bugbear. Each boat also has to have a licence, based on its catch history, which becomes progressively more expensive as they are capped. Matt explains: “Some boats are only allowed 300kg of fish under quota others can catch just shellfish, just fish or both. So if an uncapped licence comes up for sale it’s very expensive. Capping is also a way of taking out some of the boats that don’t catch a huge amount. To buy a small boat like mine with bass entitlement costs a fortune. The boat might be worth £10,000 but the licence can be £30,000.”Fortunately, help is at hand in the form of a charity, the Blue Marine Foundation (Blue). Set up in 2008 by some of the team behind the award-winning documentary The End of the Line including environmentalist Charles Clover, Blue creates large marine reserves worldwide to encourage sustainable fishing models and improve bioersity. Its aim is to protect 10 per cent\u0026nbspof the world’s oceans by 2020 and 30 per cent by 2030.The 206km sq Lyme Bay Fisheries and Conservation Reserve was established in 2008 after years of campaigning to stop trawling and dredging across certain types of ground. Persuading fishermen, conservationists, scientists and regulators to work collaboratively, Blue has proved there is a sweet spot between fishing and conservation where you can fish less but catch more with guaranteed quality.Created with Sketch.Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern Ireland Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Enda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, IrelandMorven Robertson of Blue explains how it all began. “We had a meeting in a cafe\u0026nbspin West Bay at which the fishermen almost chucked our UK Director Tim in the harbour. There had been years of trying to get this MPA (Marine Protected Area) created ...\u0026nbspWay before us, the Dorset Wildlife Trust had been campaigning because Lyme Bay has the UK’s largest population of pink sea fans, beautiful coral that supports lots of marine life, including juvenile scallops. Since the formation of the reserve, the population of pink sea fans has increased eight-fold.“The fishermen were worried about the way things were going and in 2008 the government agreed to create an MPA which pushed out all trawling and dredging. But then, other potters and netters started to fish in the reserve as they knew their nets wouldn’t get damaged or their pots towed away. It created a honey pot – the area was saturated.“So the fishermen came to Blue and said that although the area had been protected they weren’t seeing any benefit as there was too much potting and static gear – as a result, they were left fearing the imposition of a total ban on fishing and their livelihoods. We now have 32 boats and 59 fisherman signed up to our code of conduct, following sustainable fishing methods which conserve habitats and boost fish stocks. Other fishermen do work the bay, but if someone tries to put down too many pots they will tell them not to.”They’ve noticed the environmental benefits of the reserve, too. Axmouth fisherman Bob Carless says: “You can see the effects the reserve is having on the seabed. Before you get out to the six-mile limit, the seabed is full of life, undulating, natural. But as soon as you hit the six mile mark, you can see where the dredgers have left it totally flat.”The Marine Conservation Society compiles a national rating system that chefs and suppliers use as a go-to when finding out what’s sustainable and what they should be cooking and eating. But, as Morven explains, it’s completely unfair for small fleets like Lyme. “One of our fishermen sells to River Cottage and they are saying that John Dory is now a no-go as well, but ratings are based on available data often for other larger offshore fleets or boats using fishing methods we can’t use here. To obtain a rating that accurately reflects local stocks and low impact of the inshore fleet Blue is gathering data on these species with the fishermen to provide credible evidence on which to base a local rating.Just a few weeks ago the MSC, the global fisheries certification scheme announced that mackerel in the northeast Atlantic had been stripped of its blue tick. Now people are concerned we shouldn’t eat mackerel either, but what about all the guys who catch it here in the summer, with rod and line. Is that sustainable?”Forming the reserve has been hugely beneficial for the fishermen, in an industry where solidarity is vital, says Morven. “We provide them with a route to market for sustainable fish, which they sell at a premium, and regular meetings they often spend all day fishing alone, so it’s great to give them a voice.” Matt agrees: “We’re sitting down with the MMO, the Fisheries etc and they’re listening to us. That would never have happened before. Blue is giving us a mouthpiece.”Even before Blue came along, the fishermen have always seen themselves as s of the deep. Jamie says: “There’s no point in catching everything today or there will be nothing for tomorrow. Matt and I look at the sea as the bank. If you rob the bank, there’s nothing left.” Matt agrees: “It’s our culture and heritage – it’s not just about money – so we have to fight to protect it. We’re incredibly lucky to have the reserve, as it’s made it a much more viable proposition for the small boats to go out of here and earn a living.”For Jim Newton, fishing out of Beer, sustainability is a given. “It’s our livelihood so we don’t need to be told not to catch fish that are spawning. If cuttlefish eggs are found on our pots we have to leave them in the water – often for weeks – until they hatch, which of course affects our catch of lobster and crab.“For the past 20 years we’ve also been collecting tons of plastic from the sea as it can clog up our nets and pots ... Yet all that gets focused on is a tiny pile of fishing line. The number one plastic we find is those plastic beads used in packaging”.Morven explains that Blue has also helped define sustainability. “Our research showed that fishing with 250 pots is the sustainable level any more damages the reef and sees a decline in lobster and crab. They were fishing with many more pots and wondering why the lobster stocks were crashing. Now we’ve seen a 4.5-fold increase in lobster, which benefits everyone.”\u0026nbspCharlie Ziemann, a fisherman in Axmouth, says: “To me, sustainability means being able to go out again and again and again and catch the same amount of fish. We’re not taking more than is being produced.”On the back of the reserve’s success, Blue launched the Reserve Seafood brand in 2015, which now champions 29 species of premium, provenance-assured fish and seafood caught in Lyme Bay Reserve and sold to markets and restaurants across the UK. Fish in the reserve are caught by hand ing, static nets, pots or rod and line – mainly, lobster, crab, pollock and flat fish such as sole and plaice.Paul Shearing, executive chef at London’s Roast restaurant in Borough Market, is an ambassador for Reserve Seafood. He says, “For me it’s been a journey of discovery. I get my fish for the restaurant from all over the country ... These days, with fish farming, you can get on the phone and specify exactly what size you want. So I came down here fishing last summer with my nine-year-old son Alfie and got chatting to the fishermen.“Once you get out here you realise sustainability is subjective, it’s not just a buzzword. What the government says, and what you hear in London, isn’t necessarily true.“It’s a bloody hard story ... The guys can’t earn money at some times of the year, they’re out in all conditions. It made me realise how out of touch we chefs are to complain if a mackerel is 50g over the weight we’ve asked for.\u0026nbspYet fish is a natural product, migratory and seasonal, so of course every fish is a different size.He has seen, first hand, how unreliable quotas can be. “When I was out on the boat in Lyme with them they said ‘We reckon you could walk across the sea bass round here there’s so much of it’.”It’s a bloody hard story … The guys can’t earn money at some times of the year, they’re out in all conditionsTo showcase how wonderful this fish and seafood is, we gathered at the lovely Kingfisher pub in Colyton, run by fisherman Mark Dack and his wife, where Paul cooked up some fantastic seared scallops with black pudding, crab and apple, and pollock with beurre blanc: simple, quick, delicious food.Blue also gives practical help. “We built chiller units and installed ice machines, funded by the EU and maintained by the fishermen,” Morven explains.\u0026nbsp “They used to pack their catch in coolboxes or cover it with wet carpet, then drive for three hours to Plymouth and back. They now put their fish in there and it’s taken off to Plymouth market three times a week. The chillers have been such a success that they now want to build another building next to the chiller with lobster tanks – at the moment, if the weather’s rough lobsters are out in the pots rattling around, getting damaged or dying.The next stage is to increase awareness of Reserve Seafood, with plans to display the logo where it’s sold and promote the brand through their website www.lymebayreserve\u0026nbspcomplete with bios of the fisherman. The hope is that consumers will look out for the fish and create demand, as well as choosing to eat in restaurants that showcase this sustainable approach.Technology has its place too. “There’s an app on their phones and when they get on their boats they go through a geo-fence in the sky,” Morven explains. “So you can see exactly where the fish was caught. We can map this data on top of the habitats, to see which parts of the reserve are important for certain fisheries ... The rays seem to congregate on sandbanks one year we saw that all the pollock were being caught on one particular reef. And if they fall overboard, their phones send an SOS signal.”Jim adds: “It’s what I’ve done all my life. My father and grandfather were fishermen, two of my uncles still fish. Brett, my cousin, fishes from Lyme. My son runs the shop. But I can see this finishing when I finish.“You used to get boys coming down here to mess about on the boats at weekends, helping the fishermen with odd jobs and learning about our lives. But they don’t come now. Fishing isn’t seen as a desirable career.”He does admit it’s hard work:\u0026nbsp“I’ve only been out for half a day this week, and won’t be going out again until Monday, so that’s five days without fish – or income. We all have to have jobs on the side, such as building work and day tripping. And here in Beer we have to drag the boats up onto the beach using a tractor and wooden planks under the boats, greased with fat from the fish and chip shop.”Cod could be off the menu as climate change warms oceansSeabirds driven to the brink as fishing industry competes for foodThe women making their mark on Rwanda’s fishing industrySeabirds on British island suffer population crash due to lack of foodDespite the red tape, quotas, storms at sea and sheer unpredictability of what he does, seawater clearly runs through his veins. “People sometimes say ‘Oh, you’re just a fisherman’, but the job is highly skilled. You need to know where the fish are, how to predict the weather and stay safe.”It’s no surprise to learn that the fishermen look out for each other – just hearing their laughter and banter over who’s the best fisherman and the best darts player reveals an incredibly strong bond. “Even if we’ve been on a night out, we’ll all pass by the harbour on the way home in our glad rags and count the boats to make sure everyone’s in.”Angus adds, “We’ve had fishermen’s societies down here since the 19th century. Most people don’t really understand our world. We wouldn’t expect joe public to know about it, but those in charge of the industry should. Yet Defra\u0026nbspcan’t even tell us how much fish there is in the sea.”With so many obstacles and challenges, it’s easy to wonder why they still do it. Their comments were illuminating. Matt says, “If you looked at it purely financially you’d go off and do something else. What I love most is being close to nature: nothing can beat seeing the sun rise over the sea.”Bob in Axmouth agrees: “I love being out there with no one hassling you. We’re the last of the hunter-gatherers. For me, it’s an escape. I turn my phone off and it’s just me and the sea. I go out sometimes in my little 5-metre boat – usually 18 miles or so, but it can be up to 28 miles – and come back with nothing. But when you go out mid-morning, the sun over the sea is beautiful. We see lots of gannet, dolphins, even a killer whale outside Lyme Regis Bay once.” Perhaps it was the man from Defra.Visit bluemarinefoundation for more informationWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Many of M\u0026ampS\u0027 customers\u0026nbspthat want online grocery shopping\u0026nbspare already Ocado customers, he says.“It may have overestimated the lure of M\u0026ampS products, and indeed the questionable benefits of being able to order an M\u0026ampS dress with a weekly shop.”\u0026nbspThe new tie-up can be a success but only if M\u0026ampS sticks to the premium products it’s famous for like, says George Lawrie, principal analyst at market research firm Forrester.“In other words, it will work for Champagne, fresh oysters, canapes and caviar, but not for things like cling film and carrots,” he says. This marries with Ocado’s vision of a premium delivery experience, with smartly dressed drivers delivering your groceries straight to your kitchen table.Luxury deliveries work better because of cost, Lawrie explains.“Normally you’d expect picking, packing and transporting produce to amount to around 25-30 per cent of the cost of a single item, a cost that high margin retailers can absorb but low margin grocery cannot – unless everything is highly automated.”M\u0026ampS clearly can’t compete with the big supermarkets when it comes to customers\u0027 weekly shops, says Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management, which holds shares in M\u0026ampS.He is also pessimistic about the deal, describing the £600m M\u0026ampS is raising to pay for the new venture as an “extravagant use of shareholders\u0027 money”.“The motivations behind this deal for M\u0026ampS are clear, as the company has long struggled with an online offering that is not up to scratch.”The benefits to M\u0026ampS of an online food shopping are not certain because of the limited range of products it stocks, says Mumford. Consumers see it as a place to top up their weekly food shop with premium items, rather than somewhere for a large weekly shop.But that’s not so much a problem as it might once have been because Ocado has become less dependent on Waitrose products and now stocks broad range of own-brand and private label products, says Stephen Lienert, senior analyst at Jefferies.“Ocado therefore goes full circle: whereas before people used Ocado to access Waitrose products, now the supermarkets want to use Ocado.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearRumours of the wallet\u0027s inclusion on the device\u0026nbspcirculated amid a surging cryptocurrency market, which had previously seen months of dropping prices since the highs of late 2017.Several other smartphone makers have included an in-built cryptocurrency wallet with recent devices, including the HTC Exodus 1\u0026nbspand the Sirin Finney,\u0026nbspthough none have the global reach of the South Korean electronics giant.Little fanfare was made of the new feature, with no mention of it during Samsung\u0027s Unpacked event last week. Only one line in its accompanying press release made mention of it.Galaxy S10 is built with defense-grade Samsung Knox, as well as a secure storage backed by hardware, which houses your private keys for blockchain-enabled mobile services, it stated.HTC Exodus 1: The phone taking on the entire internetOne of the cryptocurrencies supported by the Galaxy S10\u0026nbspwallet is cosmee, a cryptocurrency produced by Korea-based blockchain firm Cosmochain, who partnered with Samsung for its dApp.Cosmee describes itself as a beauty social media platform that allows users to share content among other members. While it appears like a standard smartphone app on the surface, the key difference is that it will run on a peer-to-peer network – much like bitcoin.\u0026nbspThis means people\u0027s data will be spread across this network, rather than being stored on a centralised server. Users will also be able to earn rewards in the form of cosmee cryptocurency by actively participating in the community.Cosmee already has more than 30,000 daily active users in Korea, the firm tells\u0026nbspThe Independent, making it the second most popular beauty app in the country.\u0026nbspCan Norwegian waterfalls stop bitcoin from destroying the planet?The inclusion of such apps is anticipated to push cryptocurrency adoption even further into the mainstream, as people will ultimately be able to spend it and trade it on a daily basis. Contactless payments with cryptocurrencies could also be a possibility in the future, as the Galaxy S10\u0026nbsprange supports this functionality.Still more is needed before cryptocurrency becomes truly mainstream, with the final stumbling block mentioned by Mr Thomas being that of regulation. Though this may not be very far away, he warned.With regulation imminent from the UK\u0027s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), adoption of cryptocurrencies for both personal and investment purposes can only grow and with it the whole blockchain ecosystem, he said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Donna Strickland and Gérard Mourou were jointly awarded the prize for developing chirped-pulse amplification of lasers618 Discovery of a new species of dinosaurThe Ledumahadi Mafube roamed around 200 million years ago in what is now South Africa. Recently discovered by a team of international scientists, it was the largest land animal of its time, weighing 12 tons and standing at 13 feet. In Sesotho, the South African language of the region in which the dinosaur was discovered, its name means a giant thunderclap at dawn718 Birth of a planet Scientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 818 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 918 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 1018 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.1118 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.However, the team said their latest discovery was evidence of a wealth of tiny creatures scuttling around beneath the dinosaurs’ feet at this time in the planet’s history.“The Chinle frog could fit on the end of your finger,” said palaeontologist Dr Michelle Stocker, noting they were now focusing on searching for diminutive life-forms.“With this new focus we’re able to fill in a lot of those missing smaller components with new discoveries.”Extinction mystery deepens after discovery of dinosaur-era bird fossil“Our development of methods that recover delicate bones from small-bodied vertebrates enabled this exciting discovery,” said PhD student Ben Kligman.\u0026nbsp“Our aim is to use similar techniques in the Chinle Formation to uncover the early history of other small-bodied animals including lizards, salamanders, turtles and mammals.”The oldest frogs ever discovered have been unearthed in rocks from Madagascar and Poland, dating back roughly 250 million years.The specimen found by Dr Stocker and her team in Arizona was more similar to modern-day frogs than these older iniduals, but is not thought to be a direct ancestor of the amphibians seen today in ponds around the world.As the scientists continue to delve through their rock samples, they hope to find skulls and additional bones that will enable them to learn more about the Chinle frogs.The\u0026nbspfindings were published in the journal Biology Letters.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Due to a lack of knowledge about the past climate of Mars, scientists\u0026nbspcan not tell whether it came from\u0026nbspgroundwater, precipitation,\u0026nbspmelting glaciers or something unheard of.There is no liquid water on the surface of mars today, though plenty of similar ex-water features\u0026nbsphave been discovered in recent years, suggesting Mars once had a far wetter and warmer climate.Each discovery raises further questions about the planet\u0027s past atmosphere and\u0026nbspscientists ultimately want to know whether or not it would have been suitable for life.Next year the ESA in collaboration with Russia’s space program Roscomos will launch the ExoMars mission with the primary goal to “address the question of whether life has ever existed on Mars.Here The Independent has collated images\u0026nbspfrom recently discovered evidence of water on Mars in the gallery above.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But we want an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU. We regret this decision but that’s the reality.”The warning by EU leaders suggests that the bloc would impose conditions on any extension – which Theresa May offered as an option to MPs\u0026nbspon Tuesday in a bid to head off another Commons defeat.Under the PM’s plan, MPs will be asked to vote again on the prime minister’s deal on 12 March. Should it be rejected, they will be asked to vote on March 13 on whether the UK should leave without a deal.If both of those are rejected, there will be another vote on March 14 on an extension to Article 50, which would delay Brexit.Mr Macron’s suggestion that the UK would need to make “a new choice” for an extension to be granted however throws a ner in the works of Downing Street’s timeline.Though the French president did not elaborate on what such a choice might entail, the EU has been pushing the UK to soften the terms of Brexit by renegotiating its future relationship. Mr Macron’s statement also suggests time might be granted were the UK to decide to hold a second referendum, which Labour said it would back\u0026nbspearlier this week.Last week European Council president Donald Tusk said he believed an extension to Article 50 was a “rational” course of action for the UK to take, following a meeting with Theresa May. He however added that the prime minister still believed she could avoid an extension.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.”With dissatisfaction over Brexit having sparked several Tory and Labour MPs to quit their party and form the Independent Group, Sir Vince said he has been speaking to “many of these now independent MPs” and that they have “much in common” with his party.Created with Sketch.

Mr Williamson\u0026nbsphas apologised for the remarks.See below for live updatesMPs\u0026nbspto be given another chance to vote on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plans... up to a dozen amendments tabled, including one on a fresh EU referendumChris Williamson apologises for \u0027antisemitic\u0027 remarks as May leads calls\u0026nbspfor his suspensionHome secretary contradicts PM over bid to protect citizens\u0027 rights after BrexitThird of \u0027most critical\u0027 no-deal Brexit preparations are behind schedule, government admitsNEW: John Bercow has just chosen the amendments to be voted on by MPs tonight. They are:\u0026nbspAmendment A - Jeremy Corbyn (Labour) - Proposes an alternative Brexit plan, including a comprehensive customs union with the EU and closer alignment on rights, protections and the single market.\u0026nbspAmendment B - Alberto Costa (Conservative) - Calls on the government to seek a treaty with the EU to mutually protect citizens\u0027 rights if there is a no-deal Brexit.Amendment C - Caroline Spelman (Conservative) - Helps pave the way for legislation that would give MPs a vote on whether to extend Article 50 if no Brexit deal can be agreed.Amendment F - Yvette Cooper (Labour) - Seeks to enshrine Theresa May\u0027s promise to give the Commons a vote on whether to pursue a no-deal Brexit or extend Article 50\u0026nbspif her deal is rejected.\u0026nbspAmendment K - Ian Blackford (SNP) - Would require the government to immediately rule out a no-deal Brexit under any and all circumstances and regardless of the exit date.\u0026nbspNEW: Labour has confirmed that Chris Williamson will be investigated for a pattern of behaviour but will NOT be suspended while this takes place.\u0026nbspJames Cleverly raises Chris Williamson\u0027s remarks in the Commons, without mentioning the MP. You can never be too apologetic over antisemitism.\u0026nbspIn response, Theresa May calls for Jeremy Corbyn to suspend Chris Williamson as a Labour MP.\u0026nbspPerhaps if the Labour leader actually wants to take action against racism he would suspend (Mr Williamson), she said.\u0026nbspThe SNP\u0027s Ian Blackford ask the PM to rule out no deal, and asks her to stop blackmailing the country - and predictably May replies there are only two ways to take no deal off the table: vote for a deal, or no Brexit.\u0026nbspHe hits back saying Parliament will not be bullied into backing her deal. He says the SNP have moved an amendment today to rule out a no-deal, and asks the PM to vote for it. Unsurprisingly, May doesn\u0027t accept the offer.\u0026nbspInstead she criticises the SNP of raising council tax and claims the SNP - as part of the Scottish government - have betrayed the people of Scotland.Jeremy Corbyn says that growth forecasts are the slowest in a decade, and asks her wether she blames the handling of Brexit or austerity.\u0026nbspHe says the Bank of England study shows there is a one in four chance of the UK economy falling into recession.\u0026nbspThe PM responds, says there are positives created by the current government for the economy. She hits back, saying Labour would cause a run on the pound.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn his third question, Corbyn asks the PM to commit to end the benefit freeze. Naturally, Ms May does not answer the question.MPs are gearing up for ANOTHER key Brexit moment tonight, where they will have the chance to vote on the government\u0027s strategy.But what is actually going on?\u0026nbspIn a nutshell, the Commons has been presented with a neutral motion by Theresa May - which basically says it has considered the Brexit process. MPs table amendments to this motion, where they will try to nudge the strategy in various directions.It will be down to Speaker John Bercow which proposals are selected for a vote tonight. Any successful amendments will not have the force of law but will carry heavy political weight as a signal to Downing Street and Brussels of what kind of Brexit MPs are likely to approve.Here are the key amendments:CooperLabour former minister Yvette Cooper is trying\u0026nbspto pin the PM down to the commitments she made to the Commons on Tuesday to give MPs the chance to delay Brexit if her deal is defeated.May\u0027s promise was similar to an earlier plan\u0026nbspby Ms Cooper and Tory Sir Oliver Letwin. While Sir Oliver said there was now no need for the Cooper-Letwin Bill, Ms Cooper said she would lay a cross-party amendment to secure confirmation of the PM\u0027s commitment.CostaTory backbencher Alberto Costa is demanding Ms May seeks a treaty on citizens\u0027 rights after Brexit.His amendment, which has the backing of around 60 Conservatives, calls for a separate agreement with the European Union to protect the rights of expats even if there is a no-deal Brexit. Labour is also expected to support the amendment.SpelmanDromeyConservative MP Dame Caroline Spelman and Labour\u0027s Jack Dromey, who last month tabled a successful amendment opposing a no-deal Brexit, will table an amendment to pave the way for the CooperLetwin Bill to give MPs the opportunity to extend Article 50.The pair said they would seek assurances from ministers to to secure confirmation of the Prime Minister\u0027s commitments during the debate on Wednesday.They said if they receive the assurances they will not push the amendments to a vote.LabourJeremy Corbyn\u0027s amendment will seek support for his party\u0027s five Brexit demands.The party is calling for a permanent and comprehensive customs union with the EU dynamic alignment on rights and protections, and commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes.It is also seeking unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements and close alignment with the single market.LeslieMPs from The Independent Group (TIG), along with support from the SNP, Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, have tabled an amendment to pave the way for a second EU referendum.It would instruct the Prime Minister to table a motion for debate and a decision before March 8, setting out the steps necessary for preparing a public vote on whether to leave the EU on terms agreed by Parliament or remain a member.TIG member Chris Leslie said the amendment would require Mrs May to take the steps needed now so the public could take control and break through the Brexit gridlock.SNPThe SNP\u0027s amendment requires the PM to immediately rule out a no-deal Brexit under any and all circumstances and regardless of exit date.The party\u0027s Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Parliament must take control and force the UK Government to do the right thing by immediately ruling out a no-deal Brexit under any and all circumstances.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to loadWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Just holding out possibility of a short delay, too short for a #peoplesvote” she tweeted.Significantly, the prime minister refused to say whether she would “argue for no-deal or argue for extension”, if her deal is thrown out again on 12 March.Labour’s Yvette Cooper hinted she would continue to press her amendment tomorrow, to legally compel Ms May to seek an Article 50 extension if her deal is not approved.Suggesting the legal force was crucial, Ms Cooper warned: “Promised votes have been pulled before, Commons motions have been ignored before.

Tomorrow, there will be an amendment in the name of the leader of the opposition setting out the party’s Brexit demands, notably a permanent customs union. That amendment won’t mention a referendum.The Labour Party is no longer in favour of keeping all options on the table, including a public vote:\u0026nbspnow it supports a public vote, which all its leading spokespeople accept means a referendum, with Remain as one of the options. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.There are caveats and cavils. The wording of the statement is that a referendum is “to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit”. That might suggest the policy ceases to apply if parliament finds another way to avoid Brexit. If, for example, the House of Commons votes on 12 and 14 March to reject the prime minister’s revised deal, and to delay Brexit, would Corbyn still be pressing for a referendum?\u0026nbspHas the forward march of Corbynism been halted?Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, insisted on Channel 4 News yesterday that Labour would continue to support a referendum even if Brexit is delayed. But until there is what Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, calls a “credible Leave option” – that is, a Brexit deal approved by parliament – it is hard to see what the choices in a referendum would be.The new Labour policy appears to be that there should be a referendum after parliament has approved a deal.\u0026nbspThe more serious obstacle to a new referendum, however, is that it is not (yet) supported by a majority of MPs – even with Corbyn throwing the weight of the Labour front bench behind it.\u0026nbspBy my calculation the maximum support is currently 288 MPs, which is 31 short of a majority. The problem for advocates of giving the British people the Final Say is that there are more Labour rebels on this subject\u0026nbspwho are opposed to a referendum than there are Conservatives who are in favour.\u0026nbspFinal Say supporters such as Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP for Exeter, insist that there are more Conservatives, including ministers, who would back it when it comes to the crunch. On the other hand, there are probably more Labour MPs who have doubts about a referendum but who have yet to be flushed out.\u0026nbspCynics suggest that Corbyn is not entirely sincere in his support for a referendum that he has held back for so long and is now appearing to back it only to try to head off further Labour defections – and safe in the knowledge that it could not get through the House of Commons.\u0026nbspOn the other hand, however, a referendum must be one of the ways of breaking the deadlock if Brexit is delayed. And it would be hard for Corbyn ever to retreat from the position that he adopted at 5.27pm yesterday.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

It is unfortunate that instead of fulfilling its international obligation and bilateral commitment to take credible action against terrorist entities and iniduals operating from its soil, Pakistan has acted with aggression against India.\u0026nbspIt was clearly conveyed that India reserves the right to take firm and decisive action to protect its national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity against any act of aggression or cross-border terrorism.India also strongly objected to Pakistan’s vulgar display of an injured personnel of the Indian Air Force in violation of all norms of International Humanitarian Law and the Geneva Convention. It was made clear that Pakistan would be well advised to ensure that no harm comes to the Indian defence personnel in its custody. \u0026nbsp India also expects his immediate and safe return. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRegret was expressed at continuing denial by Pakistan’s political and and military leadership at the presence of terrorist infrastructure in territories under its control. \u0026nbsp A dossier was handed over to Pakistan side with specific details of Jaish-e-Mohammed complicity in Pulwama terror attack and the presence of Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camps and its leadership in Pakistan. It was conveyed that India expects Pakistan to take immediate and verifiable action against terrorism emanating from \u0026nbspterritories under its control.The Pakistani military are now saying they only have one\u0026nbspIndian pilot in custody. They had previously claimed they had two.\u0026nbspKate Hudson from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has warned the current escalation could result in a nuclear exchange.\u0026nbspWe\u0027ve been here before. India and Pakistan came close to nuclear war in the 2001-2002 standoff, where one side refused to rule out a first strike.\u0026nbspThat Pakistan’s Prime Minister has met today with his country\u0027s nuclear weapons body, is a strong indication of how real the threat of nuclear war is.\u0026nbspNuclear weapons, far from deterring war, make conflicts more dangerous than they would otherwise be. There is an urgent need for diplomacy in this precarious situation.\u0026nbspMark Martin, founder and chief executive at Martin Consulting\u0026nbspIndia, said about 800 flights a day use the\u0026nbspIndia-Pakistan air corridor, making it very critical.You can\u0027t overfly China, so you have to overfly Pakistan and\u0026nbspIndia\u0026nbspand go to Southeast Asia and Australia. Most of the traffic destined for Bangkok and Singapore will have to fly over Iran and then possibly take a detour.\u0026nbspSeveral airlines, including Emirates and Qatar Airways, suspended flights to Pakistan on Wednesday after the South Asian nation closed its air space following heightened tensions with neighbouring India.Etihad, flydubai, Gulf Air and SriLankan Airlines also suspended services to the country and flight tracking portals showed Singapore Airlines, British Airways and others were forced to reroute flights.\u0026nbspAirlines flying over India and Pakistan to Europe, the Middle East and Asia were disrupted and some flights were routed through Mumbai on India\u0027s western coast, so they could head further south and avoid Pakistan air space, an Indian government official told Reuters.Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan has officially closed its airspace until further notice, the Pakistani regulator said in a tweet.Theresa May\u0027s full comment on the current tension between India and Pakistan:\u0026nbspThe UK is deeply concerned about rising tensions between India and\u0026nbspPakistan\u0026nbspand urgently calls for restraint on both sides to avoid further escalation.We are in regular contact with both countries, urging dialogue and diplomatic solutions to ensure regional stability. We are working closely with international partners including through the UN Security Council to de-escalate tensions.India\u0027s former ambassador to the United States says that a new red line with Pakistan has been drawn.\u0026nbspRetired diplomat Lalit Mansingh said that India\u0027s policy of strategic restraint is no longer.\u0026nbspMr Mansingh says a new doctrine was established by India\u0027s pre-dawn airstrikes on Tuesday in\u0026nbspPakistani territory that Indian officials said targeted terrorist infrastructure.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHow do the militaries of India and Pakistan compare?\u0026nbspIndia, home to 1.3 billion people, has a conventional army of about 1.4 million soldiers.Pakistan, with a population of over 200 million people, has about 650,000 troops.Both countries have spent billions over the years developing conventional arms.Last year, Pakistan spent about 11 billion US dollars or about 3.6 per cent\u0026nbspof its gross domestic product on defence.India meanwhile allocated about 58 billion US dollars, or 2.1 per cent\u0026nbspof its GDP on defence, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.India\u0027s ballooning military spending has propelled it to the world\u0027s fifth-biggest defence spender, surpassing the United Kingdom, according to the IISS.What has happened since?\u0026nbspIndia and Pakistan fought a third war in 1971 over what was East Pakistan, which later became Bangladesh. In 1999 and 2000, after Pakistan\u0027s military sent a ground force into Indian-controlled Kashmir at Kargil, the two countries faced off and a worried world urged both to pull back from the brink of war, fearing it could escalate into a nuclear conflict. Even in times of relative peace the two nations readily engage in brinkmanship and aggressive rhetoric.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHow did the dispute over Kashmir begin?When Britain granted independence to the region in 1947, it ided the Indian subcontinent into a predominantly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan.Some areas could decide their own fate.In Kashmir, the only Muslim majority area ruled by a Hindu monarch, its ruler decided against giving the population a choice.That started the first India-Pakistan war in 1947.The conflict ended in 1949 when a United Nations resolution established the Line of Control iding Kashmir between the two nations and calling for a direct vote on which country should control it.That vote has never been held.Indian and Pakistan fought a second war over Kashmir in 1965.Why is the tension between these two nations so dangerous?\u0026nbspBoth India and Pakistan are believed to possess more than 100 nuclear warheads each and have conducted atomic weapon tests. Both countries have test-fired nuclear-capable missiles.\u0026nbspPakistan also has refused to renounce a first-strike option with its atomic bombs should it feel outgunned in a conventional war. It takes less than four minutes for a missile fired from Pakistan to reach India.\u0026nbspThe Bulletin of Atomic Scientists warns that computer models have predicted that the physical impacts of a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan, or even a single strike on a large city, would be devastating and would reverberate throughout the world.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIndian police say officials have recovered four bodies from the wreckage of an Indian air force chopper that crashed in Indian-controlled sector of Kashmir.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSenior police officer Munir Ahmed Khan said the chopper crashed close to an airport on Wednesday in Budgam area, in the outskirts of the region\u0027s main city of Srinagar. The Srinagar airport, which has been shut along with two other airports for civilian flights in the region, is also an air force station.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPolice said they were still going through the wreckage and did not immediately identify the victims.\u0026nbspLocal residents earlier said they saw three bodies at the site.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEyewitnesses said soldiers fired warning shots in air to keep residents away from the crash site.\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the liveblog to loadIndia has however denied these claims and said all their pilots were accounted for, according to Indian television station\u0026nbspNDTV.Earlier\u0026nbspsenior Indian police officer Munir Ahmed Khan said an Indian Air Force plane crashed in the Indian-controlled sector of Kashmir.Created with

They agree a sortie of multiple Indian aircraft crossed the “line of control” into Pakistan-administered Kashmir, although not by much, and fired towards a town called Balakot.They agree\u0026nbspthe operation was conducted in a matter of moments – an incursion of just one-and-a-half minutes in total, according to Indian defence sources – and that Pakistan’s air force scrambled its own jets in response.And that’s about it. For while India’s foreign secretary issued a statement describing the Tuesday morning air raid as a successful mission to avert an imminent terror attack, Pakistan’s armed forces insisted it did nothing more than scuff up some dirt and knock over a few trees. No infrastructure damaged, and no loss of life.Neither side is yet to prove their point. India may yet, as it did during a similar incident in 2016, produce satellite images which it claims show the destruction. One government minister said the operation had “completely destroyed” the largest training camp belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), the militant group behind Kashmir’s deadliest car bombing earlier this month. It’s the sort of damage that before-and-after imagery should easily pick up.Created with Sketch.Fire on the streets as Indians react to the Pulwama bombing attack Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Indian muslims in Mumbai burn posters of Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, center, and Hafiz Saeed, chief of Pakistani religious group Jamaat-ud-Dawa, during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir that killed at least 40Policeman walk past vehicles set on fire in Jammu by a mob during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoyVehicles are set on fire in Jammu during protests following the attackIndian Muslims hold a protest in Mumbai the day after the terrorist attack Mourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirProtestors in Jammu throw stones during a clash between communities while protesting against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy that killed at least 40 in KashmirIndian police men keep vigil next to a barbed wire fencing during the third day of curfew in JammuIndia\u0027s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party workers  in Mumbai burn a symbolic effigy of Pakistan as part of protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers pay tribute to their colleague Maneswar Basumatary, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirIndian army soldiers patrol during a curfew in Jammu on February 16, 2019A relative of Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper Sudip Biswas mourns over his coffin at Kolkata airportMourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirIndian muslims in Mumbai burn posters of Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, center, and Hafiz Saeed, chief of Pakistani religious group Jamaat-ud-Dawa, during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir that killed at least 40Policeman walk past vehicles set on fire in Jammu by a mob during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoyVehicles are set on fire in Jammu during protests following the attackIndian Muslims hold a protest in Mumbai the day after the terrorist attack Mourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirProtestors in Jammu throw stones during a clash between communities while protesting against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy that killed at least 40 in KashmirIndian police men keep vigil next to a barbed wire fencing during the third day of curfew in JammuIndia\u0027s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party workers  in Mumbai burn a symbolic effigy of Pakistan as part of protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers pay tribute to their colleague Maneswar Basumatary, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirIndian army soldiers patrol during a curfew in Jammu on February 16, 2019A relative of Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper Sudip Biswas mourns over his coffin at Kolkata airportMourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirPakistan’s foreign ministry said its side of the border was open for domestic and international journalists alike to themselves check for any signs of damage. Indeed, the ministry\u0026nbspsaid it was taking independent military observers to inspect the scene.But where to look? In the confusion after the event, the two sides could not even agree on which Balakot had been targeted – one in Pakistan-administered Kashmir or, and which would be a more serious incursion, one in Pakistan proper. Specifically, in the region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – prime minister Imran Khan’s home province.Here in India, the government has been preparing both practically and rhetorically for an operation like Tuesday morning’s. Since the 14 February Pulwama bombing, the government\u0026nbsphas collected statements of solidarity and support for action in the face of terror\u0026nbspfrom more than 48 other countries. And in the last few days, security forces in India’s Jammu and Kashmir have pre-emptively rounded up more than 300 suspected separatist agitators.Narendra Modi had promised a “jaw-breaking” response to that car bombing in Pulwama,\u0026nbspcarried out by a young local man but prepared by JeM,\u0026nbspwhich killed 40 paramilitary police officers, and in this context made a substantial retaliatory attack seem inevitable – even justified.In his statement, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale said the sortie only hit terrorist assets and thus was not an act of aggression against either the Pakistani military or civilians. He creatively described it as “non-military pre-emptive action”.India raises customs duty on goods from Pakistan to 200 per centIndia says Pakistan had ‘direct hand’ in Kashmir bomb attackIndia warns Pakistan of ‘jaw-breaking reply’ after suicide bomb attackWhat is Kashmir Solidarity Day and how is it observed?Pakistan does not view it that way, though. It has not only denied any state involvement in Pulwama, but demanded India provide evidence for the claim that JeM prepared the attack from Pakistani soil.The country’s own foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said the airstrikes were\u0026nbspa “grave aggression”, and prime minister\u0026nbspImran Khan vowed that “Pakistan shall respond at the time and place of its choosing”.At the same time it played down the impact of the airstrikes. Mr Khan said that “once again\u0026nbspthe Indian government has resorted to a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim”, suggesting\u0026nbspthe Indian account was “for domestic consumption” in the runup to imminent elections.He is not the only one pointing out that an escalating conflict with Pakistan plays well for Mr Modi and his nationalist BJP in the polls.A Reuters survey showed a marked uptick in support for Mr Modi in the immediate aftermath of the 14 February attack. He was, after all, swept to power in 2014 at least partly thanks to the image he portrayed of himself as a strong leader.Sure enough, it wasn’t long after news of the airstrikes broke on Tuesday that videos started doing the rounds on social media of jingoistic displays of Indian flag-waving, anti-Pakistan chants and the burning of Pakistan flags. One analyst who did not wish to be named told me he did not believe a surgical strike had been necessary and that it had been “orchestrated for the election”.Another defence expert, Dr Gopalan Balachandran, said the airstrikes were “clearly motivated by the JeM attack in Kashmir”. He said the death toll in Pulwama had been “intolerable” to most Indians, and that Mr Modi “needed to show that he was doing something about it”.Since 14 February, a number of opposition parties have broached the topic of the BJP making political hay out of the Pulwama attack. West Bengal’s chief minister Mamata Banerjee went as far as accusing the Modi administration of wanting to instil “war hysteria”, leading the BJP’s state president to accuse her of making “baseless allegations to score political brownie points” herself.It would be too soon for anyone to do the same on Tuesday night. Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj emerged from a cross-party security briefing to state that “all parties in one voice praised the security forces and supported the government’s anti-terror operations”.So what next for Pakistan? Mr Khan has called for both houses of the country’s parliament to sit on Wednesday to discuss the situation, and he has also summoned an emergency meeting of the National Command Authority\u0026nbsp– the body that oversees Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal.Amid the high-stakes sabre-rattling, Mr Khan has little option but to offer a military retaliation, analysts say.In ordinary circumstances it would need to be “proportionate” – but does that mean destroying a base of 300 Indian paramilitary officers, or a copse of trees? Before the country\u0026nbspcan decide on a response to today’s events, Pakistan will need to settle on – and convince others – of its version of exactly what occurred.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s top diplomat and a pillar of the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, was all smiles and at work Wednesday standing alongside President Hassan Rouhani to welcome Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to the Iranian capital on a state visit broadcast live on television.“It is the belief of myself and the Supreme Leader you are a trusted, brave and devout inidual standing on the front line against America\u0027s multilateral pressures,” Mr Rouhani wrote in a letter published Wednesday on the official presidential website. “I think your resignation is against the country\u0027s interests and I do not accept it.The show of support could bolster Mr\u0026nbspZarif’s\u0026nbspposition within the Iranian political establishment –\u0026nbsp but it could also paint Mr\u0026nbspZarif\u0026nbspas a somewhat thin-skinned and petty political player.He didn’t attempt to resign over a major difference on policy or principle.

Photos of Mr Soleimani with Mr Rouhani and Mr Assad had apparently rankled Mr Zarif, who claimed his absence from a key state visit weakened his position internationally. But Mr Soleimani said Mr Zarif’s absence was the result of a slip-up.Mr Zarif is definitely responsible for the Islamic Republic\u0027s foreign policy and during his tenure at the Foreign Ministry he has constantly had the support of the establishment\u0027s highest authorities, including the Supreme Leader,” he said, referring to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s highest authority, in a statement carried by news outlets. In an Instagram post published Wednesday morning, around the same time Mr Rouhani formally rejected his resignation, Mr Zarif vowed to continue in his job.In faint gold gold type on the backdrop of the Iranian flag, he wrote: “As a mere servant, I have had no other concern but the glory of foreign policy and the credibility of the Foreign Ministry as the body responsible for developing foreign policy.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470961972.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says corbyn ian austin","story":"His resignation is even more signicant than that of the others, except the Jewish MP Luciana Berger, in that he did not scuttle off to join a second referendum pressure group.He was a Remainer too but, unlike them, intends to keep his election promises to see the result through.Austin is a veteran Labour man, now “ashamed” of Corbyn and his Marxist mates.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Health Improvement Director at PHE, said: “While more young people are experimenting with e-cigarettes, the crucial point is that regular use remains low and is very low indeed among those who have never smoked.“We will keep a close watch on young people’s vaping and smoking habits to ensure we stay on track to achieve our ambition of a smoke-free generation.”The report shows one in  teens who have never touched tobacco use e-cigs regularly.And the proportion trying vaping before smoking rose from  per cent in  to  per cent in .However, the number of adults taking up the devices has now levelled out – with around six per cent using them.It compares with  per cent of Brits still smoking.PHE bosses are keen for adults to ditch tobacco and take up e-cigarettes instead.One Brit a minute

currently using e-cigarettes is still considerably lower in the UK than in the USA, it must surely be concerning that the rates are increasing so rapidly.”The latest official e-cig report was compiled

Fernandina Tortoise was found last month on the remote island of Fernandina in the Galapagos after the species had not been spotted since .News of this historic discovery was first downplayed because it was originally believed she would need a male partner in order to prevent the species from going extinct.Forrest Galante, the biologist and Animal Planet presenter who discovered the reptile, said the female could still save her species because of her ability to store fertile sperm until she needs it.The tortoise, now named Fern, is about  years old and when she gains weight from being in captivity may surprise conservationists by laying eggsshe has the decades-old sperm inside her.Galante told the : “Its incredible, but female tortoises are able to withhold viable sperm within them for decades, then produce offspring without having to mate a second time.“Nobody knows anything about the Fernandina tortoise because it’s the first one ever found, but given the harshness of the environment and the uniqueness of the animal, it’s certainly possible that she is able to hold viable sperm for  years.”They are able to move the sperm through contractions in and out of the storage structures.Some female tortoises can store sperm from more than one male and can then choose, which sperm she wants to fertilise her eggs with.Animals with lower body temperatures can store sperm better because of their reduced metabolic rates.Fern was captured during an expedition funded by US TV channel Animal Planet for the series Extinct or Alive, which Forrest presents.He went to the remote island of Fernandina, about miles from Ecuador’s mainland and has the La Cumbre volcano – one of the most active in the world.Galante and his team from the Galapagos National Park and the US NGO Galapagos Conservancy began the expedition with a -hour boat ride from Santa Cruz, the capital of the Galapagos Islands.Within hours of arriving, Galante found tortoise poo and an active bedding site.Fern was found completely alone and had been surviving on a green patch surrounded by lava flows.Galante said there is no way to tellshe has been alone her whole le orshe lived most of her le with another tortoise.No other male was found with Fern.The only other tortoise of the same breed to be found was male and was found dead at the turn of the century.Galante added now it’s time to find a male suitor to prevent the species from dying out, but she could lay eggs at any moment.He added: “We could mate her with another male from another nearby island, so you would have a tortoise which is very genetically close to the Fernandina tortoise and aesthetically identical.Or she could surprise us by using sperm she’s kept inside her for decades and just start laying eggs. That would be just incredible.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000472107626-e1551219962286.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"judge lonely paedos can meet","story":"Barry Cutler, , was jailed in  alongside other members of the now-defunct Paedophile Information Exchange, which promoted sex with minors.A sexual offences prevention order bans him from meeting or communicating with others who have similar convictions.But Cutler, of Beckenham, South London, claims because of his “social phobia disorder” he has no pals who are not perverts.He has now won a legal fight to contact Anthony Zalewski, an ex-PIE member with two child sex convictions.Judge Nicholas Cooke, who agreed at the Old Bailey to amend the order, said the two men had common ­interests unconnected to offending.He said Cutler, jailed for indecent photos, was “a sad figure who lacks insight into the damage done by child pornography”.Peter Saunders, of the ­Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: “It beggars belief.

But no longer.In recent months Big Ben has stood silent. Officially, it has been muted for repairs but you could not be blamed for wonderingthere was a dferent reason.Has this most resonant symbol of parliamentary democracy been gagged — had its clacker nicked — while our appalling, promise-shredding, treasonous politicians plot to overturn the  referendum’s whacking vote to leave the European Union Almost three years ago the voters gave MPs a clear instruction: Get us out of the EU. Unbelievably, the MPs are refusing to obey.Whatever tricksy waffle they spout, be in no doubt about this. The parliamentary class is telling voters to get stuffed.The last  hours have seen British politics sink to a new, squalid, guttering low.In clear daylight the express will of the people is being violated.Democratic honesty is being casually abandoned by a knot of pro-Brussels obsessives who think they can do whatever they like. And they suppose we won’t notice!Cabinet ministers yesterday tarted their Remainer consciences like dollybirds flashing their bits on Blackpool beach.Led by Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, they threatened to resignTheresa May did not do their bidding and delay our departure date from Europe.Oooh, look at us, their blatant behaviour said. Look at our importance and our Europhile goodness. All this while they accused pro-Brexit MPs of being “extremists”.Is it really extremist to respect the biggest vote in British history In any normal circumstances, a Prime Minister would have turned to Rudd and her fellow drama queens Greg Clark and David Gauke and said: “OK, resign. If you won’t support the Government, you can kiss goodbye to your six-figure salary, your free limos and all the other perks.”But Mrs May, pitiably weak, tolerated their rebellion and trotted off to the Commons to accept Brexit may be delayed.It wasn’t just Rudd, non- entity Gauke and Clark, a former SDP supporter who has resented the Leave vote from day one.A trio of lower-ranking ministerial numpties put their names to a newspaper article saying they would quit unless Mrs May obeyed their pro-EU agenda.These connivers included an insufferably moist specimen called Richard Harrington, who is barely a familiar name in his Watford constituency let alone in national politics.Even a premier as puny as Mrs May should have had the backbone to tell Harrington to fetch his coat.

Ministers have not yet provided any clear evidence to suggest this has changed.”The spokesperson added: “The Home Secretary must now demonstrate that this decision was taken in an objective and impartial way, and driven by clear and new evidence, not by his leadership ambitions.”Home Office aide Racheal Maclean said Labour’s stance was “shocking”. She said: “It’s shocking but not at all surprising that Corbyn fails to stand up to appalling terrorists and anti-semites who beyond any doubt seek the destruction of Israel and their allies.”Labour’s London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Monday said the ban was “long overdue”.Tory deputy chair James Cleverly last night stormed: “There has long been cross-party cooperation on national security, but Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party continues to reject the values that once united people across the political ide.“His refusal to back our decision to ban the antisemitic terrorist organisation Hizballah is yet another example of why even ex-Labour MPs think he is not fit to lead the Labour Party, let alone the country.”Labour last night said it would not oppose Sajid Javid’s “overall” motion which also called for the proscription of Jamaat Nusrat al Islam Wall Muslimin and Ansaroul Islam.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which was originally more than ft high - using the latest scientic techniques.One is that it stood not in the ground but probably leaning against a rock outcrop for perhaps  years before toppling into an ancient and long-gone paleo-lake to be preserved for posterity.Found in the Ural Mountains by tsarist gold prospectors in the th century, it was encased in peat for thousands of years and, despite being made of larch, is seen as one of the world’s oldest known examples of monumental art.The idol is three times as old as the Egyptian pyramids and was sculpted with the jaw of a beaver, its teeth intact.“The word demon, for example, has a very wide range of meanings even in English - from devil to good genius,” said Dr Zhilin, a leading researcher of the academy’s Age Archeology Department.‘‘In fact, given that we do not know the context , years ago, we cannot say exactly what the [markings on the idol] depicted.”But he added: “Apparently these were some kind of spirits.“Not deities, because we think that deities appeared later.”We must not underestimate the people who created the idol.“They had all the necessary tools and skills - and they had a rather complicated world view.“All the world was inhabited with dferent spirits.“And not only the animals and the trees but even the stones were animated.“We think it was something close to animism… I see in these images unity and ersity of the world around.“And it was definitely not ided just into kind and evil spirits.”He told the Siberian Times: “It is unlikely to be possible, at least in the near future, to speak seriously about deciphering of what is depicted there.“We do not have any written data, we do not have any analogues.”New artists’ impressions show how the idol may have looked propped up against a rock face.“Based on the the facts I can clearly say that it was not dug into the ground, like Totem poles,” he said.“It was standing on a relatively hard, presumably stone, pedestal, because the lower part is flattened by strong pressure and this sculpture was quite heavy.“It stood in this way but not for a very long time.”German dendrologist Karl-Uwe Heussner discovered it was on display like this for no more than around two decades.“After that a crack appeared in the middle - and a series of smaller cracks,” said Dr Zhilin.“Then it fell into the water… there was a big Shigir paleo-lake.”Another theory is that the idol could have been floated on a raft on the lake but “‘we have no data to confirm this”, he said.“It was definitely standing on some stone base in the open air and there were no supports.”It could also have leaned against a tree, he said.A leather strap or something similar might have fastened it into place.Dr Zhilin added: “For example rawhide straps - they would not leave any signicant trace.“I tend to think that it was standing near the water, in quite a secluded place, and most likely it was resting on a rock.”The idol is on display at the Sverdlovsk Regional History Museum in Yekaterinburg."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000084441597.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bat flu spread humans pandemic","story":"And now apparently, weve got to be worried about flu coming from bats.Scientists first discovered that the mammals carried flu viruses back in  but theyve just discovered that humans may be able to catch them too.Animals like pigs and chickens can catch flu in a similar way to humans because we share similar receptors in our respiratory tracts.Thats how things like bird and swine flu became so dangerous.But bat flu viruses attach and enter cells in a dferent way to these other viruses.Muhammed Munir, lecturer in molecular virology at Lancaster University, writes on The Conversation that new alarming research has found that bat flu receptors are actually really similar to mice, pigs, and chickens.Scientists compared genes to see whether they were resistant or susceptible to bat-borne flu infection.MHC-II proteins are found the surface of certain immune cells, and they help to distinguish between our bodys cells and harmful bacteria and viruses.The researchers over-expressed these proteins from pigs and chickens into human cells - and that made them susceptible to bat flu.Because pigs and chickens are able to transmit conventional flu viruses to humans, researchers over-expressed proteins from pigs and chickens into human cells, he says.These hybrid cells became susceptible to bat flu, which suggests that the virus could infect chicken and pigs.Because of the role farm animals play in transmitting flu to humans, it appeared that the bat flu virus has the potential to either infect humans directly or by first infecting other animals.But more research is needed before we all start freaking out, and this study only shows that you could be at riskyou come into contact or eat farmyard animals.They may be cute but bats are germ taxis.They carry  human diseases like Ebola, SARS and Nipah viruses, which have either been spread directly from bat to human or via another animal.Muhammed says: Intriguingly, viruses that can successfully spread and transmit between dferent bat species can also rapidly spread to people, indicating the risk bats pose in spreading zoonotic diseases.We dont know whether humans have been infected with bat flu in the past, but this research suggests that it is possible, Muhammed says.He says that the fact scientists have found that bat flu virus can be expressed in the respiratory tract means that bat flu can replicate - suggesting that the virus could be transmitted to humans through the air.The bat flu viruses could be spread by bat saliva, urine or faces. This route of transmission is more likely because of increasing bat-human contact.In fact, he goes on to say that the likelihood of bat flu infecting livestock and humans is probably high, due to the fact that bat-borne flu viruses are quite common around the globe.Importantly, because of increasing human contacts with wildle, including bats, consumption of bat bushmeat and hunting bats for both food and money has exposed humans to the zoonotic spillover of viruses.Muhammed says that eating bats could put us at risk of other viral and bacterial infections.So its a no to eating bats , and a watch this space to seeany livestock have fallen victim to bat flu."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000472343236.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brits mock magnitude surrey earthquake twitter memes chairs","story":"Twitter is awash with memes about the weak murmur, which caused littleany damage.The unusual seismic activity was felt in Epsom, Reigate and Horley, near Gatwick Airport.Locals woke up to feel their houses shaking, with one resident even saying it felt like a truck had hit the house.It comes also two weeks after a . magnitude earthquake struck parts of Surrey in the early morning.The quake was felt by  residents in the same part of the UK where a swarm of tremors hit last summer. - prompting warnings that more could be in store.But not everyone felt the same level of drama and took to social media to mock the reactions of their neighbours.Throughout the morning people have been posted memes of chairs knocked over in a garden and even one of Kim Kardashian crying."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT0004721385492.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britain faces brexit bust ups into july","story":"Theresa May was yesterday forced to offer MPs a three-month extension to Article  talks after losing a tense stand-off with Remain ministers.Twenty senior Tories had vowed to resign to help Parliament enforce the delay on the Government to take a No Deal Brexit off the table.If the PM’s revised new EU deal is not passed in two weeks’ time, she promised to let the Commons vote again to order a “short, limited” delay until “the end of June”.But senior figures in the hardline Tory European Research Group hit back to insist they are “highly unlikely” to back down and support the Prime Minister – making the delay all but inevitable.One gloomy Cabinet minister told The Sun that the development would see the nation plunged into “bloody purgatory”.Also during a day of high drama in Westminster yesterday:Mrs May told the Commons yesterday: “The United Kingdom will only leave without a deal on  Marchthere is explicit consent in this House for that outcome.”Revealing her own personal anger, she insisted: “Let me be clear, I do not want to see Article  extended.“Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on March .”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I just can’t take it anymore. I need her to be gone from here and moved on to somewhere better.”After Emily claimed she had been forced to move out, The Sun Online called in Hull-based exorcist Ralph to help, and stuck around to watch the spooky series of events.Emily moved into her Chelmsford flat seven years ago and, at first, she noticed items were moved around the house.Then she started to feel an icy sensation in her leg when she sat on the sofa, assomeone cold was sitting next to her.But, she claims, the strange activity didn’t become a nuisance until she started sitting in a dferent chair in the evening.“After that she started acting dferently,” she adds. “She upped the ante and one day when I was in the bathroom, where I believe Joyce died, she flushed the toilet over and over again. She now does that a lot.“She’s smashed cups on the kitchen floor and thrown things about. She’s taken ornaments, including the beautul angel wings that hang on the wall which she tried to flush down the toilet.“I had to start going to bed in a hat to stop her from pulling my hair out and hitting my ears. She’s caused pain in my hip and head, and stolen things from my flat never to be seen again.”Emily, a practising Christian, called in local a priest to help by performing an exorcism, but Joyce continued to terrorise her. At her wits end, she move away to the Travelodge only for the spirit to follow.I could feel her presence in the room, she says. It felt like I just couldnt escape her.“Now whatever I have to do to make her go I will do it - I just want her out.“I want her to leave and go onto the next place, wherever that may be. I trust Ralph and will do whatever needs to happen.”While Emily thought she was going to be stuck with the horrible ghost for le, exorcist Ralph had come to assure her that this spirit was far from evil, and wouldn’t be dficult to sort out.Preferring the term negotiator to exorcist, Ralph claims he communicates with spirits in order to perform a soul collection - moving spirits on to whatever lies beyond the grave.He performs exorcisms, a spiritual practice often associated with the Catholic Church, that sees spirits removed from homes, areas and even people by commanding them to move on.“I started seeing spirits and energies when I was a boy, as early as six years old,” Ralph explains. “So I’m very much able to clear energies, ghosts and evil spirits from homes or people.“I’ve worked with people who have contorted like in The Exorcist, dealt with walls caving in due to demons and I’ve been thrown across rooms by powerful evil forces. But that isn’t the case here.”And despite being in demand to deal with exorcisms up and down the country, Ralph normally charges no more than £ for his services, paying for his petrol to and from Hull out of this payment.Ralph explains that Emily’s pesky spirit is low level, known in his profession as a level four, and is more like an annoying child, who may be pulling her hair and smashing items in order to get attention rather than instil fear or pain.Cases like this are common for Ralph - who reveals he turns ice cold when he senses Joyces presence.“The spirit will be as frightened as we are,” Ralph assures. “We just have to give her time and a gentle persuasion - and we all need to just accept she is here and relax to help her on her way.”Standing in the bathroom, Ralph places his hands on the wall and his knuckles start turning white as he says the spirit is getting closer to him.He asks for complete silence while Emily calls Joyce forward.“Joyce, please come forward and meet us,” she confidently asks the spirit, beginning the exorcism. “We want to help you. Come on, don’t hide. Say something, dont be afraid.”Silence - apart from a bird chirping, which in itself seems spooky in the middle of the night, and a slow clunking from the shower.Ralph commands Joyce to move with him to the bedroom.Asking Emily to sit down on the bed, he closes his eyes and waves his hands through the air.He recognises another spirit in the room, Emily’s Irish father, who is apparently overlooking the process.The news is reassuring to Emily, who says she feels safer in his presence.“I call Joyce and her family to step forward,” continues Ralph. “Let all the spirits unite as one energy form, moving her out of the house as one. By the use of higher authority, I ask you to move forward.Emily continues: Im asking you to move forward, Joyce. There will be peace for both of us, we will be happier. This is what I want - and we send our love with you on your way.Ralph points to the hallway with an expression of shock, but there’s no ghost when we all turn around. Instead, he calmly explains that the suffering is finally over for Emily. Joyce is gone.“I could hear her footsteps going out of this room,” Ralph says with a smile as the exorcism concludes. He hands Emily a small vial of holy water, the pair hug and he leaves.Slightly disoriented and still shaking from the experience, a genuine smile appears on Emily’s face for the first time in months - she feels that Joyce’s presence is gone at last.Now sleeping again without her protective hat, and getting her first full nights since her horrying first encounter with the spirit, Emily says she is a testament to Ralph’s work as an exorcist.“When all this started I stopped singing - but now I can sing again,” she says.“I can’t wait to start singing and dancing around my home now that she’s gone. It’s such a relief. Finally I’ve got closure.“Ralph has truly done something amazing - I trusted him fully and I could never thank him enough. I never thought I’d get my le back, but it was all down to the exorcist.”Sadly, a week after the exorcism Emily revealed that Joyce was back.Shes not in the flat but in another part of the building, which I think is the hallway, she told us. And shes very angry.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Cabinet minister Sajid Javid blurted out today that the Government will BACK a bid by Tory MP Alberto Costa in crunch Brexit votes tonight. Government aide Mr Costa faced being sackedTheresa May did not accept his amendment calling for a joint UK-EU commitment to protect the rights of expats, even in No Deal. Yesterday the Prime Minister stopped short of giving her support, instead saying: A separate agreement for citizens’ rights is something the EU have been clear they do not have the legal authority for. If it is not done in a Withdrawal Agreement, these issues become a matter for member states unless the EU were to agree a new mandate to take this forward. But today, in confusing scenes, the Home Secretary told MPs there was nothing wrong with an amendment by Mr Costa. And askedthe government was accept it now he replied decisively: Yes. UPDATED STORY BELOW:   Yet after a brief pause Mr Javid added quickly: What do you mean now  When was the government not supporting it  When did you hear that  An MP on the Commons Home Affairs Committee replied: Yesterday. Mr Javid said: From who  The MP said bluntly: From the Prime Minister. Mr Javid replied: Did you , before shting awkwardly in his seat. Dozens of Tory MPs including grandee Sir Graham Brady, a string of former ministers including Dominic Raab and Iain Duncan Smith, Remainer Dominic Grieve and Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg signed Mr Costas amendment last night. Jeremy Corbyn had already committed Labour to supporting the plan.  MP Mr Costa told  News he was seeking urgent talks with Tory whips to find out what was going on. Mrs May pulled the sting out of the Brexit votes on Tuesday by vowing to give MPs votes on No Deal and delaying Brexit. But while she kicked her Brexit high noon down the road to mid-March, she still faced a series of potentially damaging defeats. A cross-party group of MPs led by Labours Jack Dromey and Tory Caroline Spelman tabled an amendment that would force the Government to hold a series of indicative votes on Britains future relationship with Europe on March . If successful, the move would set a precedent for Parliament taking control of the Brexit timetable, which the PM has fiercely opposed.  Tonight should also be the moment when Labour formally commits to supporting a second referendum when, as expected, its own Brexit alternative plan was defeated. However, there were early signs that some Tory eurosceptics could swing in behind the PMs deal. Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told the FT he would be happy to accept an appendix to the deal rather than reopening the whole thing.

Yesterday Mr Rees-Mogg, who leads the anti-EU European Research Group, claimed a delay would be a plot to stop Brexit .And in a curious development, today he showed signs he could soften his demands to what he needs before passing a deal. The comments are crucial because they give Theresa May a tiny glimmer of hope that her Brexit deal could get across the line by March . However, sceptics also suggested Mr Rees-Moggs demands are still never going to be met and his softening could be a ploy to delay and decision and eventually trigger No Deal. Thats because, crucially, he is demanding a date on the Irish backstop - something the EU says it wont accept.   The row revolves around the Irish backstop, a clause in the -page Brexit deal that could extend EU customs rules over the UK from  January . On January , Mr Rees-Mogg declared: As long as the backstop is there I will not vote for this deal. But today the Tory appeared to drop his demand for the backstop itself - which is tied up in the unchanging -page deal - to be changed. Instead, he said he would accept an appendix added afterwards that adds extra certainty to the backstop. He said: It has to have equal weight to the Withdrawal Agreement. So,it were to be an appendix that would be satisfactory, but then the backstop is itself an appendix, so you can add to the Withdrawal Agreement without re-opening it, it seems to me. So, that would work, but it must be of equal legal standing.  If Mr Rees-Mogg and Tory Brexiteers were to team up with  Labour MPs who are against delaying Brexit, they could - in theory - delay Brexit.But his comments by no means clear the way for Theresa Mays deal to pass by March . Thats because Mr Rees-Mogg is still demanding a date on the backstop - something the EU have said wont happen. He told the BBC: I can live with the de facto removal of the backstop, evenit isnt de jure. What do I mean by that  I mean thatthere is a clear date that says the backstop ends, and that that is in the text of the treaty, or equivalent to the text of the treaty.  If it were to be an appendix to the treaty - bear in mind the Irish backstop is in itself an appendix to the treaty - so,you had a further appendix that said this will not go beyond a particular date - and a short date, not a long date - then that would remove the backstop in the letime of parliament. And that would have a reasonable effect, from my point of view. It came as the Tory party descended into a row over the bid to delay Brexit. Theresa May today urges MPs to do their duty and vote for her deal by March  so our country can move forward. She adds I do not want to see Article  extended and I firmly believe that a deal is within our grasp. But dramatic reports have emerged of a row at yesterdays Cabinet meeting where the PM unveiled a plan to delay. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom branded her Remainer colleagues - who forced the PM into a U-turn - disgraceful, appalling and disloyal, its claimed.  And Liz Truss, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, accused them of kamikaze behaviour, according to reports. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said speaking out against No Deal had totally undermined the PMs negotiating position in Brussels and her ability to deliver her deal successfully, according to the Daily Mail. One of the Remainer posse, Claire Perry, is said to have muttered: Oh for Gods sake, Andrea! Chancellor Philip Hammond is said to have joined calls for a delay. Backbench Tories were furious at the prospect of a delay.Two Tories, Priti Patel and Grant Shapps, today warn: Voting to extend Article  is a vote for a second referendum.

And thats the problemShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  FEB Newsopinion\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIts not surprising that one of Labours most dishonourable members was recorded saying the party had been too apologetic for the anti-Semitism that infects it.What is surprising is that a roomful of people applauded and laughed at Chris Williamsons claim, despite the fact they are all grown-ups and must surely know what an apology looks and sounds like.The dictionary defines the word apology as: A written or spoken expression of ones regret, remorse, or sorrow for having insulted, failed, injured, or wronged another.And heres the thing. Theres been no apology worthy of the description. The idea that an absence of contrition is, somehow, an overdose of the stuff is straight out of an Orwellian nightmare. There have been plenty of not-pologies: sorry for offence caused, sorry for pain and distress, sorryanyone thinks weve let them down, sorry but its not my fault. Its the same as apologising for the train being late to Auschwitz, in that it doesnt exactly address the real problem.Anti-Semitism has been eating the Labour Partys reputation from the feet up for  years. And what has Labour done about it  . Didnt immediately kick out all the anti-Semites When Ken Livingstones mouth kept saying stupid things about Hitler, he was suspended, then suspended again, and eventually resigned claiming I abhor anti-Semitism while making it quite clear he didnt know what it was. Momentum vice-chairman Jackie Walker was suspended twice in , first for claiming Jews financed the slave trade and then for saying she couldnt find a definition of anti-Semitism she could work with. She demanded Jewish MP Luciana Berger be censured for complaining. The party promised the case would be dealt with last year, but its still in abeyance. For every election candidate caught claiming our children are being brainwashed into thinking Hitler was the bad guy and suspended, dozens more are not. Labour had about  complaints of anti-Semitism, and still had  of them to deal with last year. Deputy Leader Tom Watson has just sent them another  - make that , with Mr Williamsons contribution.Someone will say Labour is merely obeying its rules and giving everyone a fair hearing. But justice delayed is justice denied, and you dont kill a virus by letting it live a bit longer. . Couldnt agree what anti-Semitism is  The scandal forced Labour to become the first mainstream party to have rules on anti-Semitism which it could use to discipline people.But despite the fact % of its members backed the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliances definition, activists argued the Jews had got it wrong. They caused months of damaging headlines as they tried to contextualise it, before the partys ruling body stepped in to overrule them.. Allowed anti-Semitism at the launch of its anti-Semitism report  To prove he was serious about stopping this, Jeremy Corbyn ordered a report from Shami Chakrabarti, who had been hurriedly made a party member and thereafter a baroness. He invited one of his own MPs, Ruth Smeeth, to the press conference. She had supported him previously and he hoped shed tell journalists Labour was cool with Jews.An activist was handing out leaflets. Ruth asked for one. The activist refused and wrote her name down for talking to journalists. He later took the microphone and accused her of colluding. Corbyn said nothing, but later apologised to the activist for the fact hed been knocked over at a previous event.Corbyn knew anti-Semitism was bad enough for his image that he needed a report into it he knew it needed support from his Jewish MPs so invited some he had, one hopes, read the report and knew accusations of collusion were an anti-Semitic trope and when it happened in front of him, he apologised to the anti-Semite.The activist was later expelled from the party - but too late to stop the damage he had done.. Kept doing anti-Semitic things A Jewish MP has been hounded out of the Labour Party. Other MPs have left after being subjected to interrogations for criticising anti-Semitism. Councillors have resigned, and tens of thousands of members have left.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell is chairman of the Labour Representation Committee, a pressure group within the party, which has described the scandal as ruling class propaganda.And it has questioned even today why Hezbollahs political wing is a proscribed terrorist organisation on the basis it has been democratically elected. Never mind that its waging a holy war against Jews.. Failed to figure out what an apology was When Bradford West MP Naz Shah was found to have written posts on Facebook that appeared to support the deportation of Jews, she was suspended. She spoke and more importantly LISTENED to the Jewish community, and issued fulsome apologies in the Jewish News, House of Commons, and media interviews. She said: The language that I used was anti-Semitic, it was offensive. What I did was hurt people. She showed remorse. She acknowledged the harm she had done and explained how it had happened. She changed her behaviour. She was, quite rightly, given another chance.Corbyn has admitted Labour has not done enough. He has said Jews deserve an apology. And his statements been misreported as apologies, when theyre not. An apology would say: I did not realise when I was campaigning for peace in the Middle East it might have worked betterId spoken to some Jews. I failed to be decisive because it would mean admitting Id been wrong. Labour has a historic problem with Jews, and Im going to fix it.  The most anti-Semitic thing Labour has done is not a single, shocking case: its the total inability to stop the stench of anti-Semitism being its biggest problem. The obtuse, blinkered, ignorant and arrogant refusal to clean its own wound. Thats what convinces Jew-haters they have found a home. It becomes normal to ask whether someones ethnicity or religion makes them unacceptable, to say the Jews are making it up. It becomes OK to applaud a man who says you can apologise too much.Harbouring a disease means you ARE the disease. Labours inability to lead means others who share none of its values get a free pass to hate Jews more loudly, and to hand out the same bile to other races, sexualities, abilities and faiths.Labour has not apologised enough for the hate it has allowed to fester.

Leon Beamon had always qualied for Disability Living Allowanceever since he was born with a condition which affected the growth of his left leg. The primary school pupil has already undergone numerous operations, wears a shield around his ankle, leg and foot, and faces more hospital procedures.But mum, Kelly, is devastated after the Department for Work and Pensionsstopped the DLA funding which was partly used to fund the car, StokeonTrentLive reports.Now Leon, from Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, has been left to use his wheelchair to get to and from his school because he suffers pain after walking for just five minutes.Mother-of-two Kelly is Leons carer and is now on Universal Credit .  The -year-old said: When Leon was born his left leg wasnt growing properly and had fused to his ankle bone which caused a deformity. He had an operation to try to correct his ankle deformity and was told it will never be  per cent. Also to en the part of his leg that isnt growing he needs another two operations on his bone in the future. He also has to wear a shield around his leg, ankle and foot. Without the mobility car weve had to walk to school and hes been forced to use his wheelchair because hes in so much pain. The walk to school is uphill and to force him to walk would be cruel. Leon loves the outdoors but without the car I have no way of taking him anywhere as the wheelchair limits the places we can go to without the car. Leon cant understand why it has gone.   I have appealed against the decision to stop his allowance. But the DWP stands by its decision because he can put one foot in front of the other and can cross the road. But its not that simple. His hospital consultant has confirmed Leon has limited mobility in his ankle, he requires extra supervision during school activities, and requires a wheelchair on any walk over five minutes - but the DWP says he can walk. Leon was on the higher rate because of his limited mobility and I could understandthey had put him on the lower rate but to stop it altogether I cant understand it.  Grandmother Janys Wright has been left disgusted by the DWPs decision. She said: This decision is totally ridiculous. The DWP has defended its decision. A spokesman said: We’re committed to ensuring that every child gets the very best chances in le which is why we’re spending more than ever before on DLA for disabled children. Decisions on DLA for children are made following consideration of all the information provided by the family and their GP or medical specialist, and anyone who disagrees with a decision can appeal.

The quaint th Century pub near the beach has received more than  “excellent” or “very good” reviews on TripAdvisor. The Plume has four stars out of five with  reviews, where it is listed as second out of nine restaurants in Portscatho. However, there are  “terrible” critiques from members of the public - which he often challenges. Roger told one diner he hadn’t “cringed this much in a long time” at their post. He compared another to “a small child that can’t have a biscuit. Many people on social media have praised Rogers attitude. I think the pub Landlord sounds like a legend, wrote one woman. Another posted: Excellent answers! Well done the landlord...Another Facebook user wrote: I want to go just to meet the Landlord. What a legend! I loved his responses. Cornwall Live compiled some of Rogers best responses... Complaint  One diner put on TripAdvisor: Just popped in for some food, was told they were too busy. Said we’d just have some drinks, they basically suggested that go someone . Rude, arrogant. Rogers y reply read: “Now now Kitty, its not nice to call people names. But seeing as youve decided to go on the worldwide web and call me names like a little child who didnt get what she wanted when she demanded it, let’s talk about your visit. “Folks, it was a Saturday evening on the bank holiday weekend of the half term, it was between  and .pm. This is possibly the most premium time food wise in any restaurant or pub, especially in a little Cornish pub in the middle of a holiday destination. We were at full flow, every table taken, tables had been booked weeks in advance, the kitchen is maxed out. “However, Kittyminx,she comes to the bar with her children and says Chips, I want chips for my children. I responded with an apology and said thats fine but there will probably be about a  or  minute wait and probably apologised again. “You seemed stunned by this, so I went onto explain that we were absolutely maxed out and there will be a waityou want to go ahead and order then we had that awful  or  seconds where you just blinked and stared at me like I was speaking a foreign language, so I then said the taverna down the road is open and they do takeaway food as well, which might be a better option at this moment in time . “I actually thought I was being helpful, giving you options, but obviously you didnt see it this way. Someone dared to say no to Kittyminx! “Now, Kittyminx, when you leave ‘reviews’ like this, it actually says more about you than the venue. Because, generally, we then go into your profile and read your other reviews and have a little chuckle. You use the words Rude and Arrogant with gay abandon dont you  We read about when you complain that the waitress had asked you to stop your children playing on the stairs  times, the poor girl … or when another venue got slagged off because you werent allowed to move the furniture … Kitty, you had probably put [it] in front of a fire escape or something. “Trust me Kittyminx, when it comes to rude and arrogant you might want to look a little closer to home.”   Complaint  Another diner was upset with birthday celebrations at the pub. They wrote: “We had waited all summer to have a meal at the Plume of Feathers ... very popular with tourists, no chance for locals! “We booked for Monday night as it was the actual birthday! Bad mistake! We were squeezed into a passageway! With another table reserved for later making it a very tight squeeze! We had three courses: soup, main, dessert all were warm and the meat was very tough! “Chips were under-cooked and soggy! The waiter was over the top with compliments which appeared to put pressure on us! No extra attention though given to the birthday men! I.e. a candle in their dessert or an extra biscuit! The waiter was told two of the party had birthdays! The bill was expensive to the quality of the meal! “So … tourists you are welcome to the Plume of Feathers we will not be going back! A little attention would have been lovely evenit was to sit in a restaurant with a table laid and flowers present! Then the bill wouldnt have mattered! Very disappointing as we are locals!” But in a y reply, Roger defended the boozer. He wrote: “ exclamation points!! !! Folks, here we have the very controversial ‘locals’ scenario. This seems to happen in two locations, Cumbria and Cornwall. “When someone says they are a ‘local’, this is not to be confused with a ‘regular’. When someone enters your premises and keeps dropping ‘were locals, dont you know’ into the conversation, generally, theyre not really. “Quite often they will be from outside the county, say, somewhere like Peterborough, and theyve just moved down very recently and immediately want all the trimmings of being a ‘local’. If you dont treat them as such, evenyou have never seen them ever before in your le, they will scuttle off and go on TripAdvisor. If you do, they are full of praise and everything is wonderful. But, we just treat everyone the same. Sorry. “I would say that over % of our customers are ‘real locals and regulars’ so Im not sure what the nasty little jibe about tourists means. “We apologise that we were still busy in November and we had all our tables booked out … bloomin’ locals coming in booking tables! We apologise that the waiter was complimentary towards you, he has been dealt with severely, he wont be doing that again in a hurry, oh no! “Im sorry we didnt make more of a fuss of you for your birthday, but perhaps you were in the wrong place as you call us a restaurant, we are in fact just a little country pub. Perhaps you thought you were in TGI Fridays or Chiquitos where I think the staff are made to sing to you when they find out its your birthday, youll like that. “Please tell me, what did that curry house in Peterborough do so wrong that you had to visit it seven times and slag it off every time. Did they not put candles on your naan bread  You should have told them youre a local!! Hold on, Peterborough  I thought you were a local down here ”   Complaint  Another customer labelled the pub as having the “worst customer service ever!!!” The man wrote: “We visited the Plume of Feathers to meet up with family and friends who were all visiting from up north for a wedding. We were all treated with disdain from the landlady and her staff. “They were rude, unhelpful and made it blatantly obvious that we were not welcome. I dont know why her attitude was as it was, but it really spoiled what should have been a joyous celebration. The beer and average food was way overpriced, the toilet was filthy and stunk of urine and the interior was at best, shabby. She refused to serve any spirits because it was too early. “The top and bottom of this review is this,you visit the Plume and dont buy their way overpriced food, then you not welcome to just have a drink. “In my opinion, not worth a visit, over-priced, overrated and an arrogant landlady who’s had a charisma bypass. Worst customer service, ever.” However, Roger disputed some of these points and accused the diners group of swearing. He said: “Wasnt quite like this was it  You arrived en masse at .am and seemed surprised that we didnt serve alcohol before am. But then at am the drinking commenced. “We didnt refuse to serve spirits at all, becauseyou remember, when the young ladies found out that we didnt sell Blue WKDs in our little Cornish village pub they started drinking gin and bitter lemon. They said this was ‘lush’. So dont tell lies. “Now, you maybe alluding to the fact that we refused to sell shots at .pm. We did think it a little early and unnecessary. The younger lot seemed to agree with us and said things like ‘sound’ and ‘probably best’. But you decided to go on and on about how its the done thing up north. “Seeing as you had only been drinking Carlsbergup to this point and your behaviour was already deteriorating at a vast rate of knots, we feel we made the right decision on not serving shots at . in the afternoon. Eventually my we had to ask you to stop swearing loudly in the pub as other people were coming in with children. I think its at this point that my we had the ‘charisma bypass’ because you then went into the loud heavy duty swearing. “So then, instead of my we asking, she told you to stop swearing, to which point she even had to get the poor father of the bride to ask you to leave because of your behaviour. “You didnt eat in the pub, so that little jibe about the food is obviously a rather pathetic attempt to make yourself feel better about your behaviour. The toilets were cleaned spotlessly in the morning and the only people that had been in the pub all day was you and your party, so I feelthere was any issues there, you may want to look a little at yourselves. “If you are asked to leave a premises due to your behaviour, just take it on the chin. Dont put sad little ‘reviews’ on websites. It embarrasses yourself and this one has embarrassed the father of the bride … again. I believe he did ask you to remove this post, but I guess you dont have that much respect.”   Complaint  Another reviewer criticised the food: “We took some ‘fresh’ fishes for us and chicken balls and fries for kids. Food was absolutely disgusting, for kids - everything from microwave. Sorry, I cant recommend. Maybe its good place for beer, but, unfortunately not for families with little ones.” After explaining that the fish is delivered fresh twice a day, Roger wrote: “If you cant tell the dference between microwave chipsfrom freshly prepared triple-cooked chips, Im not sure you have the skills to be putting ‘reviews’ on websites. “What are chicken balls  ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"  Complaint  Another user wrote: “I was askedI had reserved a table number, I am sitting outside.

Adele Barbour tragically died as a result of the collision on the A near Lincoln. The -year-old died in hospital after a cardiac arrest, Lincolnshire Live reports. Questions were raised by coroner Marianne Johnson on the actions of emergency workers who mistakenly thought she was pregnant. An investigation was launched by the East Midlands Ambulance Service. Miss Barbour died on January  last year as she had pulled in front of a Toyota Yaris while trying to turn right.   She had been indicating right off the A to turn into Wash Dyke Lane when she pulled in front of the Yaris travelling on the other side of the road. Miss Barbour had a cardiac arrest and was rushed to hospital. However, questions were raised by coroner Marianne Johnson at the inquest into her death on the actions of emergency workers who mistakenly thought she was pregnant. A C-section was carried out at the hospital because they thought she might have a baby due to her protruding stomach - only for them to discover she was not pregnant. At an inquest held at the Lincoln Cathedral Centre on Tuesday, February  a collision investigator was called to give his report on the circumstances of the crash. PC Mark Brown said in his evidence: “Adele Barbour has failed to give way at the junction. She has pulled into the path of a Toyota Yaris across in the south-west-bound lane. “For an unknown reason she has not seen the oncoming Toyota Yaris. “Adele Barbour was driving her black Vauxhall Meriva on the A Lincoln Road at Nettleham. “She had started to turn right and has failed to give way and driven into the path of an oncoming Yaris. “The other driver was confronted by a car in her carriageway and had no way to avoid it. “There is no evidence that herdriving caused the collision.” At the inquest, a post mortem investigation gave the medical cause of deathas a laceration of the aorta. Witness Nicola Ware was one of the first on scene of the collision. She was driving to work as a paramedic for East Midlands Ambulance Service. When she arrived, she said Miss Barbour was sitting conscious in her car and complaining of back pain. She said: “I went towards the car that Adele was in. I asked her name and said that I was an off-duty paramedic on my way to work. “I asked hershe had any pain and she said that she had pain in her back and that she had a pre-existing back condition. “She did not mentionshe was pregnant. She had a large puffa jacket on so I had no reason to believe that she was. “I proceeded to the other car and I phoned the control roomto explain that I would be late and I was told it would be a while before getting a crew on the scene.   “Another lady at the scene then shouted me back across to Adele as she thought she was fitting. “She was unconscious but she had a pulse and she was breathing. “The fire service arrived and I asked them to help me to get her out of the car and she went into cardiac arrest.” Other paramedics from the private medical group Elite EMS and LIVES also arrived at the scene to help. Staff who arrived on scene raised concerns that Miss Barbour may have been pregnant due to a protruding stomach so precautionary measures were made while giving her CPR. The inquest also heard evidence from James Bidwell from Elite EMS, Chris Cole, a paramedic at LIVES, and Emma Haskey, a clinical support manager at EMAS. A GP report read out at the inquest said that she had received major surgery in  for spina bida and was also diagnosed with chronic leukaemia in . In all of the live evidence given, it was heard that the decision was made to move Miss Barbour to Lincoln County Hospital due to her unstable state and repeat cardiac arrests, unavailability of the air ambulance and the possibility that she may have been pregnant. Evidence from Emma Haskey heard at the inquest said: “In a pre-alert to the hospital I informed them there was a female patient after a road traffic collision with a query to whether she was eight months pregnant and that I would update them with more information when I could. “Later I was updated by the Emergency Operations Centre who told me that a C-section was carried out and the patient was found not to be pregnant.” Sam Smith of EMAS concluded: “In my opinion from the evidence I don’t think that the crew could have done any more than they did. “I would not recommend a dferent course of action.” The inquest is due to conclude today.

After an estimated  tremors occurred between April and September last year, an investigation led by the British Geological Survey found that they were due to natural causes, Surrey Live reported. A report by the Oil and Gas Authority concluded that there was no causal link between oil activity in the area and the earthquakes. An excerpt from the report read: The workshop participants concluded that, based on the evidence presented, there was no causal link between the seismic events and oil and gas activity. Campaigners, however, were not convinced by the reports findings. Oil exploration at sites at Horse Hill and Brockham have been named by anti-oil activity protesters as the potential cause of the tremors.

Ross Mclaughlan, , says he was left speechless when he received a letter from the Child Maintenance Service back in  telling him he had a teenage daughter. The -year-old, from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, was not married and claims he had no idea who the girls mum was.He told the Daily Mail : I was so confused and didn’t recognise either the girl’s name or her mother’s, but told myself they’d either got the wrong Ross Mclaughlan, or that someone had targeted me as part of some scam.I was very wrong. It’s eight years since that letter arrived and, despite me never having seen or even spoken to the girl named in it, nor having any contact with her mother, I’ve had pound, deducted from my wages and been told I owe a further pound,.”   Ross says he initially tried to ignore the letter but then decided to pay the pound-a-month sum so it wouldnt jeopardise his job. He refused to take a DNA test as he felt it went against his human rights. But four years ago, he was hit with another letter from the CMS, telling him that the child support costs were increasing to pound a month. If he paid, it would mean he was left with an income of just pound after tax.   So he decided to look into the case further and request a copy of the girls birth certicate, which he says showed a dferent mans name under the father section - one who had the same surname as the girl and her mother. Ross immediately wrote to the CMS hoping that would be enough evidence to prove he wasnt the father and stop the payments. But he received a reply saying the certicate was not enough proof that the man was the child’s biological dad and so the money kept going out of his account. Things got even worse when the daughter turned  and he was told that he would have to pay a further pound, in retrospective payments. Ross described the whole case as being extortion and likened it to something that happens in a fascist state.   The woman claims she fell pregnant after a short fling with Ross and gave birth to their daughter in June . Her ex-husband allegedly became suspicious and requested a DNA test which proved the girl wasnt his, according to the woman. The daughter told the paper that she did wonder why Ross didnt get in touch when he found out about her from the CSA. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions, which oversees the CMS, said: “We noty people before making deductions, to ensure they have a chance to contest parentage. When parentage is disputed we look for conclusive proof such as a DNA test or a court declaration. A birth certicate can be used as evidence, but would be discountedthere’s a suggestion that it’s unreliable.

Brave Kara Clarke told the Daily Record how she has been attacked, called names and had ‘vicious lies’ spread about her since starting school in August. Her mum, Josephine, called on the authorities to help get to grips with bullying, saying her daughter had been “targeted from day one”. The schoolgirl, from East Kilbride, was removed from her classes by her family, who say she was “beaten up inside and outside school grounds”. Soon after the bullying started, Kara says she struggled to find a release from her mental and physical torment, and took the decision to try and kill herself.   Heartbroken mum, Josephine, said: “I don’t want my girl to become another statistic. “Things got to such an extreme that Kara tried to kill herself on a number of occasions – she’s even self harmed IN school. The worst attempt was in November when she tried to jump off a bridge at lunchtime. “She was kept in hospital for four days. Now she’s self-harming and I’ve had to remove everything from the house and her room that she could use to hurt herself.” Police Scotland confirmed they responded to a call from Josephine on November  where she raised concerns for the wellbeing of her daughter, and that Kara had been taken to hospital. Kara’s first attempt on her le came two weeks after the sudden death of a -year-old Strathaven Academy pupil – a tragedy that left staff and pupils devastated.   “The same officer who came out was the one who responded to the incident involving the young girl from Strathaven Academy”, said Josephine. “I really felt for him, I couldn’t even imagine dealing with that.” The Daily Record understands Duncanrig held an assembly about bullying following that horror, but pupils were never officially informed about any incidents. Describing how the bullies make her feel, Kara said: “I’m silently in tears, but it’s not sad tears, it’s more rage. “The anger that builds up inside scares me. Part of me is happy to be out of the school, but part of me misses being with my friends. “And I’m missing art class, which I love.” Lindsayfield mum-of-four, Josephine, says a safety plan was put in place for Kara – who is currently being assessed for autism and ADHD – by the school. That saw her spend intervals and lunch breaks in a room accompanied by a friend and teacher.  But the childcare student claims the school broke the agreement after just one month, leading to Kara being attacked on school grounds and making another attempt on her le. Josephine says an emergency meeting with, school staff and the family was held. Kara’s guidance teacher, a school nurse, social worker and representatives from child and adolescent mental health servicesare said to have been there, with police offering input. She added: “The school put a safety plan in place where she wasn’t allowed on ‘the street’ where all the kids congregate because that’s where most of the issues were happening. “She got put into a room at intervals and lunchtime and wasn’t even allowed to go to the toilet herself – that’s how bad things were. The school breached the safety plan by allowing Kara back onto ‘the street’ without my knowledge. “She was attacked, but I was never informed about any incident or assault – it’s simply not acceptable. What happened to getting it right for every child  “Kara has been left feeling like she is the one always being punished.” Josephine has now taken steps to have Kara transferred to another South Lanarkshire school, telling us that her daughter “loves school and loves to learn” and that she “has her future all mapped out”. She added: “I don’t want her to lose that love, but I’m constantly in fear of what she might do. “I’m too scared to even go into her room in the morning wonderingshe is going to be alive. That’s how bad it is.” Head of education for the council, Lynn Sherry – who deals with support services and the school estate – said: “Anyone reading this story cannot fail to see that this is about the mental health and wellbeing of a very vulnerable young person. “There are genuine concerns that this sort of public exposure can only add to that vulnerability. We fully understand and share the concerns raised by the mum about her daughter, and would like to make it clear there has been signicant ongoing support from the school and health colleagues over a period of time to help deal with the mental health and wellbeing of this vulnerable young girl. “This will continue to be the case with the school pursuing expert help.” Whatever youre going through, the Samaritans are there to listen any time, free from any phone on  .

Heather Bellamy is battling leukaemia for the fourth time.As well as gruelling chemotherapy she has also had to unsuccessful stem cell transplants and has now been told there is nothing more the NHS can do for her. But a drug, Idha, could save her le as shes one of a number of patients struck down by the disease because of a gene mutation. While Idha is available in the US it has not yet been licensed in the UK and Heather has been told the NHS will not pay for her treatment.   Now, her desperate family have launched an appeal to raise the pound, so she can travel to America and have the drug. Her father, John, said: “Heather was a nurse for  years before she became too sick to work, first in neonatal care then as a nurse advisor at NHS Direct. After that she became a community nurse then a lead practice nurse in respiratory care, helping people with asthma and the lung disease COPD lead better lives. “Her career was so important to her, and she helped so many people – but now she is the one who needs help and I am praying everyone will help her.” Heather is determined to stay alive for her four children, Lilly, , Alice, , Alfie,  and Sam, , and her parents, John, , and Angela, , are doing everyting they can to get her the treatment. Angela, a former teacher, said: “We’ve spoken to lots of people, from consultants to MPs about Idha, and the hope is that it will be available in the UK one day – but not in time for Heather. “It’s very dficult knowing there is something in the world that can help, but feeling held back by red tape.”   Mum-of-four Heather, of Downham Market, Norfolk, was first diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia, a cancer of the blood cells, in December . Years earlier she had her thyroid removed, meaning she had annual blood tests to monitor her progress – one of which detected her cancer. John, who has retired from the RAF, said: “A routine blood test in  revealed she had leukaemia. “It was incredibly shocking. Angela and I hadn’t even heard her say she’d been feeling unwell. It was an awful lot to take in. “We found out over the phone, as we were living in Spain. It’s one of those things you don’t ever think will happen to you.” From there, Heather had three rounds of chemotherapy and went into remission. But, less than a year later as she prepared toto work as a nurse, she relapsed in September .  Angela said: “We thought we could move on and put this horrible thing behind us – but then it came back, and so the search began for a stem cell donor. Sadly, none of her family were a match.”Heather’s search for a donor was successful but the transplant itself was put on hold when she developed sepsis , when the body attacks itself in response to an infection.Thankfully, she pulled through and after more chemotherapy at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, had her first transplant in February , using stem cells provided by an anonymous donor. Angela said: “It all seemed to go well, but by the summer of  she had relapsed again, and doctors discovered that she also had the IDH gene mutation. “After that, Heather had more chemotherapy before she ended up in intensive care when she had sepsis a second time. “She was too ill to attend her daughter Alice’s graduation, which she was very upset about.” A second stem cell transplant followed in October  and, once again, Heather and her family felt optimistic for the future when it appeared to have worked.  Every month that passed with her still in remission allowed her hope to grow stronger. But then, in December , she was dealt unbearable news for the fourth time. Angela said: “She’d been in remission for long enough to begin to hope, but then we got the news she had relapsed again. “She tells us her strength comes from the love for her four children and to be there for them when they need her. Its remarkable that shes kept going. Currently having chemotherapy to help manage her symptoms rather than cure her, Heather, who has an incredibly supportive partner Max, , has been warned that there are no further treatments available on the NHS. So, her family are determined to get her to the USA, where she will be able to receive Idha, which doctors there are able to prescribe. In patients like Heather, the IDH mutation blocks young blood cells in the bone marrow from maturing into healthy adult cells – but, Idha works by releasing this block.  To fund transport, accommodation, hospital bills and the drug itself, though, the Bellamys are facing a mammoth target of pound,. A GoFundMe page has already raised more than pound, in just a month and Angela and John are now praying kind strangers will keep helping them to keep their daughter alive. John said: People have been incredible. We want to thank every single person who has helped out so far. “The community has rallied round, but the problem we have is getting Heather’s story out there on a wider scale. “There must be somebody out there that can help us. All we want is to keep her alive. “We have been racking our brains to think of fundraising ideas outside the box. Somebody out there, whether its entrepreneurs, big companies or even football clubs may be able to help us.

In a post on Facebook , the Australian woman wrote: At the risk of looking like I have no idea , anyone know what these dangling things might be from the tree next door Wonderingits something a little sinister. She added that the pods appeared to have spider webs around them, then shared a series of photographs to give people a better idea of what she was dealing with.And to her horror she was then told that the so-called pods were probably filled with around  baby spiders each.  Locals from the Sydney area began suggesting that the sacs could be the work of magnicent spiders or bolas spiders. One woman said the spiders were super cool and would parachute down with little parachute webs when the eggs hatch. But this did little to appease the mum, who wasnt impressed with the thought of spiders coming down onto the trampoline.  Despite the disturbing situation, the spiders should pose no threat to the woman according to the Australian Plants Society NSW.They said that magnicent spiders pose no threat to humans and revealed that the spindle-shaped egg sacs take several nights to construct. Baby spiders will emerge from the sacs in late winter, before they are carried away by the wind.

And, like many of us, when she ed to work she would regularly check emails , Facebook and Instagram as she commuted into work.But after a frantic day at the office and then the demands of home le - feeding and bathing baby - she would retreat into mind-numbing social scrolling until way past my own bedtime. Siobhans partner, as a working father, would often come home from work exhausted and turn to his phone for some horizontal bliss. But as the couples workload seemed to do nothing but increase, Siobhan realised they needed a digital detox to get back to us.  She launched a  day challenge - no phones, laptops or TV after pm.

Gale-force gusts and heavy downpours, coupled with the rough seas, is believed to have caused the unusual phenomenon. The devastating storm has caused major damage and disruptions on the roads along the coastal area of the Mediterranean island. And the government issued a warning of high threat to le and property. But the gusts sent piles of sea bream flying off the sea and landed on the roads in Xemxija, near St Pauls Bay in north Malta.  A number of residents have been risking their lives to pick up the fish and collect them in piles. A man can be heard saying: One of the fish farms must have broke open, and theres hundreds and hundreds of fish that have been blown ashore, and these people are here picking up the fish from the middle of the street.But its not the first time people have looked up and found unusual things - from animals and fruit to cuts of meat - falling from the skies. Here are some of the others...Gone Geese  Over  geese suddenly fell from the sky during a thunderstorm above Idaho Falls, Idaho in April .Around  dead geese were found in a car park and  more on the top of a nearby warehouse. Mobile phone footage caught the moment the birds plummeted to the ground. Conservation officers determined that the birds were probably killed by one or more lightning strikes as they were flying. Jacob Berl said: “It’s just a freak accident.” Icy iguanas  It was so cold in Florida last year that it was literally raining frozen iguanas. Temperatures were so chilly in the Sunshine State it rained iguanas as the frozen lizards fell out of trees. The cold blooded lizards become sluggishthe temperature drops below C. And when the mercury fell to just C, the poor, frozen iguanas thudded out of their tree homes, unable to move.  Spider stormIn January last year spiders appeared to fall from the sky in Brazil’s southeast state of Minas Gerais.Videos posted onto social media showed screaming onlookers looking up to see hundreds of tiny black spiders rained down. In fact the arachnids were actually suspended in a huge web which has been spun to catch prey. The species of spider, known as parawixia bistriata, are known to make their webs high up. The web they spin is so fine it is nearly impossible to see with the naked eye, giving the impression the spiders are falling from the sky. Joatildeo Pedro Martinelli Fonseca, who recorded the phenomenon, said he was stunned and scared”. Flying Fish  Residents of Lajamanu, a remote desert town in Australia, saw hundreds of small white fish fall from rainclouds during two days in . Weather experts in Australia believe the fish, spangled perch, many of which were still alive, were sucked up in a thunderstorm and carried up to , feet up in the air before being dumped over the tiny town. And incredibly it wasn’t the first time - Lajamanu, which lies  miles from the nearest river, has reported being bombarded by falling fish twice before, in  and . One resident, Joe Ashley, , said: Usually fish are in the water and now they are falling out of the sky. Whatanything bigger falls out of the sky next  It could be crocodiles, that would be real scary. Flying before they can swim Tadpoles  Residents of Japan’s central Ishikawa prefecture were baffled in June  by the apparent downpour of tadpoles all around the coastal region. Clouds of dead tadpoles were reported falling from the sky in a number of cities, including Nanao where  tadpoles were found covering the windshields of cars in a  square metre area of a car park. Another dead tadpole downpour was reported by local officials  hours later in the city of Hankusan, in the same prefecture. Officials at Kanazawa Local Meteorological Observatory told local media that they were unsure how the tadpoles had arrived as there had been no reports of strong winds at the time. Winged Worms  In July , Eleanor Beal, a police department employee in Jennings, Louisiana, reported thousands of earthworms falling from the sky as she crossed the street to go to work. When I saw that they were crawling, I said, Its worms! Get out of the way! she told news channel WAFB. “Its very scary, Ive never seen anything like this in my le” Communications officer Martha Amie also witnessed the downpour, saying: “They were all over the street. I looked in the sky, there was no clouds, we werent under the poles and we werent under the trees and I couldnt believe it. “I just ran back inside because I didnt want any more to fall on my head.” Less than five miles away and about the same time, a tornado had touched down on a local river - which some believe may explain how the worms got into the air.an apple a day  A show of apples from rush-hour traffic to a halt in December  as the fruit rained down on car roofs and windscreens. The deluge left a -yeard stretch of the B strewn with green slush after the bizarre incident. One motorist, who was travelling with her husband, said: The apples fell out of nowhere. They were small and green and hit the bonnet hard. Everyone had to stop their cars suddenly. The phenomenon is believed to be down to a mini tornado which touched down where, sucking apples from the ground or from trees before travelling for miles and depositing the fruit over Coventry. Another theory is that the apples could have fallen from the hold of a plane. Bird invasion The largest recorded incident of dead birds falling from the sky occurred in Georgia in October . Over two nights at least , birds, made up of  dferent species, littered the runways at the Warner Robins Air Force base. Some believe these birds had all been caught in a lethal thunderstorm, then thrust into high altitudes by massive winds where some were unable to breathe and froze to death before raining down on the earth. Another theory is that the birds were disorientated by the air base’s bright lights, which they followed straight into the ground. Meat Mayhem  In what seems like something straight out of Cloudy With A Change of Meatballs, people in Kentucky witnesses huge chunks of fresh red meat falling from the clouds in . The meat showered down over a  yard long and  yard wide area, and each piece measured three to four inches long. On inspection the meat was identied as mutton, or possible venison, and contained muscle, lung and connective tissues. Although no conclusive explanation of the meat deluge has been found, some locals suggested a flight of well-fed buzzard had regurgitated their meal while flying above. Boiled bats  In January  hundreds of bats fell from the sky in Sydney, Australia, during a heatwave whilch boiled their brains. Most of the dead bats were babies, who are particularly susceptible to extreme heat. More than  of the bats were left scattered on the ground or hanging lelessly from trees as temperatures topped  degrees F . Kate Ryan, who manages the bat colony in Campbelltown, said: “They basically boil. It affects their brain – their brain just fries and they become incoherent. “It would be like standing in the middle of a sandpit with no shade.” Holy Cow "},{"url":null,"title":"india pakistan kashmir live conflict","story":"\"liveBlogUpdate\": [Frustrated backpacker Nicolle Paisley, who was on the flight which turned back earlier today, said: #xCWe#xve been back for hours now, no food or water.

We appreciate it as a club and I know the players do.“When we play against teams they do pick up to their maximum in terms of their performance, they raise their game a little bit but it helps us in that push to pick up the points in the run-in.”Tonight, United will be without defender Freddy Frans after he had to come off with a groin injury at the weekend.He will see a specialist about the problem and, while United are hopeful he will not be out for too long, he has no chance of making tonight or Sunday, when the teamsto Tannadice to battle it out in the Scottish Cup quarter-finals.Rachid Bouhenna came on for Frans then had to go off late on with a facial injury, but could be OK.“Freddy is probably looking at a longer time out.

The pound million screw will be positioned right on the old mill weir on the River Ayr opposite Ayrshire College. The weir originally drove an old cornmill on the site. Now tens of thousands of pounds a year will be generated by the flow of the river. Updated plans are now being considered by South Ayrshire Council, which is behind the scheme through the local Energy Agency. They show a single archimedes screw turbine at the old Nethermills Weir. Consultants Mann Power Hydro say: “Completion of this project will create a supply of renewable energy into the local distribution network, proposing firstly to sell the majority of output locally to meet the electricity demands of Ayrshire College, where the grid connection will be made. “In mitigation, the project includes a historic improvement to the passage of eels, lampreys and salmon smolts at the weir by the provision of new specialised passes for these species, and also improves upstream and downstream migration for salmon and other fish species. “It will moderate the flows into the existing passes in some conditions, which will make these less challenging. “This will help ameliorate a general problem whereby a weir is a barrier to migration of fish.” It is predicted the turbine - more than  feet in diameter and  feet long - will generate up to  kilowatts per year. The blade will turn at a maximum  revolutions per minute The Energy Agency carried out a study last year to estimate the energy potential passing over the weirs at Nethermills. It is expected the council will pocket pound, a year from selling the power and the scheme would receive a pound, feed-in-tarf. The single four-bladed screw is enough to power  homes. A report said: “With proper maintenance the scheme should continue to generate clean power for many decades after its capital cost has been repaid. “The scheme would provide an eye-catching and interesting landmark in the middle of the town, an emblem of the community’s dedication to the principle of sustainable development. A decision on approval is expected shortly.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyrAyr NewsEnvironmentScottish rivers"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"rescheduled resurfacing a77 maybole north","story":"NewsRescheduled resurfacing for A Maybole North GatewayIn order to complete the resurfacing of this .km of carriageway as quickly and safely as possible, it will be necessary to implement a full weekend closure of the trunk road.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsThe A between Maybole North Gateway and Smithston will be closed for the weekend \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFollowing postponement and delay due to adverse weather conditions, Scotland TranServ is now planning to resurface the A between Maybole North Gateway and Smithston over the weekend of Friday, March  to Monday, March .

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"sos-to-keep-youth-club-afloat","story":"AN SOS has been issued in a bid to keep a village youth club open.Walkerburn Youth Club needs adults who have an interest or experience in working with young people to get in touch.The club meets at the Public Hall every Thursday evening from . to pm -

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"letter support the raf benevolent fund","story":"Last month’s vandalism at the Bomber Command memorial highlighted the very worst and the very best of our communities.I cannot thank your readers enough for their incredible support in the wake of this shocking paint attack.To date we have received more than £, in donations to help the RAF Benevolent Fund meet the repair bill.Repair works have now been completed on the memorial and it is now ed to its former glory.As well as the donations received, the RAF Benevolent Fund had thousands of messages of support from around the world.It was heart-warming to see the regard in which the memorial, the veterans and the , men it stands to represent are held.We must never forget their sacrices and the RAF Benevolent Fund is proud to beof this tribute to their legacy, for generations to come.As the Fund enters its th year of support for the RAF family, we must not forget those veterans who are still with us.Our aim this year is to ask for the public’s help in reaching more of these veterans and their families, while we still can.Our support could help pay for the care costs of an RAF widow, or provide for mobility aids to keep an elderly veteran at home, or simply allow a veteran to enjoy his retirement in dignity and comfort, through a regular financial grant.Put simply, the RAF Benevolent Fund looks after the RAF family.

Norman Mackenzie, etc.The chairman, at the outset, welcomed all to what he was sure they hoped and felt pretty confident would be the last annual meeting during the war, for technically the war was still with us, although they all hoped and prayed that within a very few weeks a conclusion would have come to it and they would have entered upon the complete enjoyment of a conclusive peace."},{"url":null,"title":"young bakers produce perfect pancakes","story":"The future generation of Salvation Army bakers produced perfect pancakes under expert guidance.Pancake professional Margaret Raeside helped Brooke Oxborrow, , and Tianna McMillan, , make enough of the flat round cakes to feed an army last Saturday.As well as honing their baking skills in the kitchen, the girls served tables of visitors in the hall.In addition to freshly flipped pancakes and perfectly packaged home-baking, trinkets and gts, created at the church#s Make and Munch craft group, were also for sale.The event raised £. for church funds.Brooke Oxborrow, Margaret Raeside and Tianna McMillan making perfect pancakes. _csalarmyMyrtle Reid, left, holds knitting she created, while Michelle Plant holds a frame made at the church#s craft group.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Last chance for Mundell to put country before party","story":"The majority of these demands are perfunctory, of course, made in the knowledge and expectation that they will be ignored by the target, while playing well with the initiatorrsquos supporters.The craziness of the last few months has precipitated a flurry of genuine and warranted resignation demands, however, which under normal political circumstances would have resulted in multiple ministerial heads rolling in any other era the Prime Minister would have been forced out long ago.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysAnother case in point is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, whose stubborn insistence on being ineffectual in the face of the biggest crisis this country has faced in generations is matched only by that of Jeremy Corbyn.

As the Scottish Secretary is well aware, businesses will fail, jobs will be lost and real people will suffer the sort of real hardships that will be dficult to recover from.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has written to Mr Mundell, laying out the gravity of the situation and calling on him to back growing cross-party demands to halt the Brexit process by extending Article  and making clear to his boss, Theresa May, that he will resign unless she faces up the extremists in her party and takes no-deal off the table.At this critical juncture, the least that the people of Scotland deserve from the man who represents them at Cabinet level is honesty about where his loyalties lie: will he put country or party first  Mr Mundell, it really is that simple.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitOf course, Mr Blackfordrsquos letter also highlights the bleakness of the dilemma facing the SNP. If Mrs May gets her way and Parliament is faced with a last-minute binary choice between her terrible deal - which deprives us of the key benefits being in the EU - and an even more catastrophic no-deal, it leaves the party in a dficult position. How should Nicola Sturgeon instruct her MPs to vote in this scenario  Backing Mrs Mayrsquos ldquomy way or the highway deal would be criticised by many as a U-turn of epic proportions and a sign of weakness. Not voting for it, and thus facilitating a no-deal Brexit, would likely be viewed by many voters as unforgivable, leaving the party open to allegations that this is the outcome it has been secretly hoping for all along, in order to boost support for independence.Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues will be hoping the growing number of Tory ministers and backbench MPs ndash including Cabinet secretaries Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke - poised to revolt against their leader should she refuse to rule out a no-deal Brexit, will come to their rescue in the frantic days and weeks to come.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysThe emergence of the The Independent Groupmay also end up helping the SNPrsquos predicament, at least in the short term. Formed last week when eight MPs resigned from Labour unhappy at Mr Corbynrsquos disastrous leadership, it did not initially appear to be an important development. But when three Tory MPs also resigned and joined up, using the moment to launch a blistering attack on Mrs Mayrsquos disastrous Brexit strategy and their partyrsquos lurch to the right, it started to feel more signicant.What binds these MPs from dferent sides of the House of Commons is dismay at the drt of both parties to the extremities.

Higher still, drunken angels keep their own council, enjoying the fruits of their out of touch immortality.What emerges out of designer Kenneth MacLeodrsquos magnicent funereal set is a series of noisy visual tableaux to accompany the live music inbetween rhymed exchanges between the eccentric members of an accidentally thrown together underground community. With the sixteen-strong ensemble swathed in celestial light and shade conjured up by Simon Wilkinson, this makes for a slow-burning meditation on le, death and the messy bits inbetween, where any chance of resting in peace is unlikely.As with much of Vanishing Pointrsquos previous work, there is plenty to reflect on here about loss and grieving. This lends a poignancy to things, especially as related in Dalyrsquos magnicently quasi-Dickensian delivery. This time out, however, there is a kind of bittersweet acceptance and a playful levity pulsing things. So while there are ghosts haunting them all, from Malcolm Cummingrsquos Young John and Peter Kellyrsquos Old Peter who mourns him, the peace they crave is enlivened by a song and dance routine to brighten up their sorry start of affairs.It takes the young, embodied here in the spirit of Olivia Barrowcloughrsquos Little Annie, to fight the collective inertia which binds them. From here, they rise up against those on high and storm Heavenrsquos gates, as each and everyone sings out for the great refusal, and for the joy of le itself."},{"url":null,"title":"mccrone-reacts-as-famous-scottish-independence-oil-report-published-in-newspaper","story":"Professor Gavin McCrone said the situation had ldquocompletely changed, while plummeting oil prices in the second half of the s meant the massivesurplus would not have lasted.His comments came as the pro-independence National newspaper published the McCrone report, which was written and researched in  as a briefing to ministers before Labour took power, in its entirety.Prof McCrone, who was then a senior civil servant, told The Herald: ldquoWe had a situation in the s when there were enormous oil discoveries going on all the time, and the revenues were going to be very large.ldquoBut today, we are in a situation where the oil is declining in importance and the revenues have come a way down. The price, well ndash theyrsquove gone up slightly a bit, I suppose, but they will never be what they were.He said his analysis of Scotlandrsquos ldquoembarrassing surplus would not have lasted, because ldquothe oil price came rattling down in the second half of the s.He added: ldquoIt might have been the case at the time. I think these things were probably put in my report to make ministers wake up to the importance of the thing.The -year-old said oil was ldquostill important, but itrsquos nothing like as important as it was back then.Prof McCronersquos  report said the discovery of North Sea oil had ldquocompletely overturned the traditional economic arguments used against Scottish nationalism.It added: ldquoAn independent Scotland could now expect to have massive surpluses both on its budget and on its balance of payments and with the proper husbanding of resources this situation could last for a very long time into the future.It said that ldquofor the first time since the Act of Union was passed, it can now be credibly argued that Scotlandrsquos economic advantage lies in its repeal.Elsewhere, it stated: ldquo[An independent Scotland] would tend to be in chronic surplus to a quite embarrassing degree and its currency would become the hardest in Europe, with the exception perhaps of the Norwegian kroner.The report was classied as ldquosecret and given a restricted circulation because of the \"extreme sensitivity of the subject\", and only came to light in  following a Freedom of Information request by an SNP researcher.Prof McCrone told The Herald he was surprised by the totemic place it now holds in Scottish debate as he never thought it would see the light of day, but said henever felt it was hushed up.He said: ldquoMy thing was never intended to be published. It was a confidential report for ministers ndash these things always are, protected by ious rules.He added: ldquoI didnrsquot expect it to be published. I didnrsquot write it to be published.

The new software — which can be used on desktops and mobile browsers — allows website visitors to customise what they see and hear, from changing the contrast settings, language, font size and more.In the UK, there are estimated to be . million people with a learning disability and . million people who have English as a second language. ‘Recite Me’ has the ability to translate the NorthLink Ferries website into more than  languages — including Scots Gaelic . It can also translate text-to-speech to help visually impaired users and focus screen areas for those with dyslexia.On Monday, February , teams on board MV Hamnavoe hosted an Access Panel Orkney session, where staff were provided with disability awareness training. During the two-hour session, staff were able to experience what it’s like to have a disability by wearing glasses that simulated blindness, used wheelchairs and crutches and had their hearing dampened.Carolyn Grfiths of Access Panel Orkney said: “The aim of our session was to let staff experience disabilities first-hand so they can empathise with passengers’ needs.#All of us running the training have a disability so we were able to provide first-hand examples of what accessible travel is like for us. We were delighted to be welcomed on board to provide this training and it’s great to see a company like Serco NorthLink Ferries take accessibility for passengers seriously.”The MV Hjaltland will also host a Making Connections workshop today, Friday, February . The workshop will look at how passengers navigate potential barriers when changing from one mode of transport to another. Making Connections brings disabled people together with transport operators to discuss, address and plan how travel connections can be made easier.Seumas Campbell, customer service director at NorthLink Ferries, said: “Catering for passengers with ying degrees of disability is an important part of our service provision. Whether they are using our website to book their journey, making a connection from other forms of public transport or coming on board one of our vessels, we believe that passengers should experience a service that caters to all their needs.“The new website software will allow visitors to customise what they see and hear and as more and more visitors from around the world choose NorthLink Ferries to travel to the Northern Isles, ‘Recite Me’ is a great tool to help them plan and book their journey.“Our workshops are also a great way in training our staff on how they can best help and understand passengers’ needs. We pride ourselves on having a great team that always provides the best service so it’s important that we’re constantly refreshing their training.”For more information on accessibility for passengers on NorthLink Ferries, you can visit www.northlinkferries copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Orkney MSP has today, Tuesday, urged the Scottish Government to #pay heed to the realities of fuel poverty.#The figures, published by the Scottish Government, showed that the fuel poverty rate in Orkney was  per cent — compared to  per cent in the City of Edinburgh.“Fuel poverty levels are shameful Scotland-wide in this day and age,# said Mr McArthur.#However, these figures underline that rural and island communities are disproportionately badly affected.“I have consistently made the case for recognition of this alarming disparity, and I am glad that the Housing Minister has now agreed to look at options to recognise that ahead of Stage Two of the Fuel Poverty Bill.“Orkney and other rural and island communities urgently need targeted action to reduce the astronomical rates of fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupWednesday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute. And we would lose both those groups without the toilets which put the museum in jeopardy.Black Isle ward councillor Gordon Adam said: ldquoI am in discussions with the council over the time limit of March , my view is that the council needs to be flexible. Savings have to be made, but sticking rigidly to a timetable leaves little time to form development groups.Wednesday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it. I hope that something can be done to continue their good work.Two service users who wished to remain anonymous praised ACSRS for the help they received. One said: ldquoI can honestly say that ACSRS played a major part in my recovery.

I think I first saw the murals last year and they are quite stunning. Whoever is doing it is obviously very talented. Itrsquos a fascinating site. We know Invergordon became a naval town and was the base for the Home Fleet in World War I. These tanks were built for the supply of fuel to warships and they were in use until the mid-s.Mrs Brown said like many street artists, the person who carried out the work may wish to remain anonymous and even be fearful of prosecution.ldquoI just donrsquot know. But what they have done is quite beautul. I am sure we could find more projects for them in Invergordon including the town house which the community wants to take back into public ownership.A website documenting historical and derelict places in Scotland reveals the depot was built in conjunction with secret oil storage tanks a few miles away.It records the underground tanks were built to hold  million gallons of oil fuel and were built into a solid rock hill to protect it from bombs.On February ,  a Junkers  is reported to have carried out a solo attack on the tank farm, dropping two lb bombs damaging two tanks. But none of the bombs exploded although they cause a major spillage of oil.Mrs Brown said she understood there were plans to remove some tanks to build houses. She said: ldquoBut it takes time for these sites to be decontaminated from their former industrial uses.In , flats built in Joss Street had to be demolished because the site, which had been formerly used as a gas works, hadnrsquot been properly decontaminated.What do you think  Share your views by emailing us at newsdesk@spp-groupWednesday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

He confirmed he would table an amendment to today’s motion seeking MPs support for his party’s own customs union deal.The Prime Minister said the Brexit deal would be voted on in the Commons by  March and thatit was rejected again by MPs, there would be a vote the following day on whether to leave the EU without a deal.If the Commons rejects a no-deal scenario, there would then be a vote on  March on whether to ask the EU for a “short, limited extension”.Downing Street declined to say how Conservative MPs would be whipped in the votes or whatof extension would be offeredit came to a motion to extend Article .Mrs May said: “Let me be clear, I do not want to see Article  extended.“Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on  March.“An extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European Parliament elections.“What kind of message would that send to the more than  million people who voted to leave the EU nearly three years ago now “And the House should be clear that a short extension – not beyond the end of June – would almost certainly have to be a one-off.“If we had not taken part in the European Parliament elections, it would be extremely dficult to extend again, so it would create a much sharper clf edge in a few months’ time.”The Prime Minister added: “An extension cannot take no deal off the table. The only way to do that is to revoke Article , which I shall not do, or agree a deal.”Mrs May had faced a wave of resignations by ministers determined to vote for an amendment from Labour MP Yvette Cooper, seeking to tie the government’s hands on an extension to Article .The Prime Minister said her proposals met the timetable set out in Ms Cooper’s amendment. She called on MPs to reject it in votes today, arguing that “tying the government’s hands by seeking to commandeer the order paper would have far-reaching implications for the way in which the United Kingdom is governed, and the balance of powers and responsibilities in our democratic institutions”.In a bid to prevent a rebellion by Tory Brexiteers in two weeks’ time, Mrs May said work would continue on ways to avoid the controversial Irish border backstop from coming into force.“The UK and EU have agreed to consider a joint work stream to develop alternative arrangements to ensure the absence of a hard border in Northern Ireland,” she told MPs. “This work will be done in parallel with the future relationship negotiations and is without prejudice to them.“Our aim is to ensure that, eventhe full future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, the backstop is not needed because we have a set of alternative arrangements ready to go.”The Prime Minister’s critics failed to welcome her U-turn. Mr Corbyn said that “until the Prime Minister is clear what alternative she would put forward in that circumstance, then she is continuing to run down the clock”.He also confirmed that eventhe Prime Minister’s deal was approved by MPs, Labour would seek to make it subject to a “confirmatory referendum”.Veteran Europhile Tory Sir Kenneth Clarke said Mrs May was simply “pushing back the clf edge”.The SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford told the Prime Minister to prepare for a longer extension, saying his party was selecting candidates for the European elections in May.Mr Blackford said Mrs May “could not be trusted” not to dodge another meaningful vote. He urged her to hold votes ruling out no deal now.A cross-party group of MPs will push for a second EU referendum today.

One Jewish peer told colleagues that it was “dficult to go amongst the Jewish community and be a member of the Labour party”.Responding to the wave of resignations, the peers were nearly unanimous in saying they “understand what they’re doing” and “neither condone nor condemn it”, the source said.Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell admitted that the party needed to be “quicker and fiercer” in responding toincidents of anti-Semitism.In a bid to calm the anger over his handling of the anti-Semitism storm, Corbyn appointed the former minister Lord Falconer to lead a review of the party’s processes.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year. Her performances have also caught the eye of the Celtic women#s team and she was recently invited to join the club#s national performance squad for a year#s trial. last week. #I can fly down and be in Glasgow on a Friday and fly back to be in school on Monday morning. It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DUNVEGAN-CASTLE-SNOWDROPS-3.jpg","title":"nae pasaranwhen scottish workers stood against a fascist","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere can#t be many pensioners from East Kilbride who are Commanders of the Republic of Chile. It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award.

A similar structure linking Denmark and Sweden will be used as a guide when investigating the logistics of the bridge.Ian Paisley welcomed the positive discussions.He said: “This move from a Red Light to an Amber Light shows progress and is encouraging for a future Green Light on the bridge project.”Speaking to the , Mr Paisley added: “This is a matter I have raised at our select committee and now the transport secretary is taking this forward to find a way of supporting a feasibility study. “That would be a signicant move and would be most welcome.“Obviously this is at an early stage but it wouldn’t take a blind man on a galloping horse to miss the opportunities for employment commerce and tourism!“Any feasibility study would have to look at where the bridge would leave NI and enter the mainland all of that will now need to be considered.“As a unionist it’s very obvious to see the added attraction of linking our kingdom in this physical way.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

It is expected to be complete in five weeks.This will improve road safety along this extremely busy stretch of the A and is welcome news for the , drivers who use the road each day.In advance of the main A junctions improvement scheme, the Department has already closed up a number of gaps in the central reservation and installed central reserve safety barrier at three locations between Hillsborough and Loughbrickland over the last two years, totalling approximately five kilometres.The temporary traffic management required to carry out the works safely will consist of speed restrictions and lane closures adjacent to the central median in both the northbound and southbound carriageways. To minimise disruption to motorists, the lane closures are scheduled for overnight, between pm and am every night including weekends from March  until April  . The speed restrictions will apply at all times for the safety of road users ‎until works are fully completed.The Department has programmed the work and traffic management arrangements to minimise any inconvenience, however, drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Completion of the work by  April  is dependent on favourable weather conditions, however, the Department will keep the public informed of any change.For traffic information about this and other improvement schemes visit: www.trafficwatchniUrinated on the shelves at Tesco and struck security guard on eye Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"lockhart supports special olympics coffee morning","story":"DUP Upper Bann Assembly member Carla Lockhart has added her support to the Banbridge Special Olympics Club along side MP David Simpson, Cllr Paul Greenfield and Cllr Junior McCrum.

Do you know who I am  I’m Richard Chestnut and I know who you are.”He struck the security guard on the right eye.Defence barrister Seamus Lannon said his client was short of funds but had £ with him in court, although he had indicated to him that his might not ‘cut the mustard’.District Judge, Mrs Bernie Kelly, said Chestnut had been aware of this since November andsomeone turned up at court with the money in their pocket this was a demonstrable sign of remorse.Mr Lannon said that in the pre-sentence report his client did present himself as remorseful.He added that Chestnut had found a job involving double glazing and would be prepared to repay the money.Judge Kelly said the defendant was urinating on shelves in Tesco at seven in the evening when children, parents and grandparents could have been present.“It was a reprehensible act,” she added.Last call for entries as Northern Ireland Tourism Awards head to Armagh for  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The judge said there was CCTV coverage and Chestnut says ‘do you know who I am’ because of the amount of alcohol he had he had a lapse of memory and didn’t know who he was.Mr Lannon said the defendant accepted he ‘behaved irresponsibility’ but was attempting to draw a line under this and make good to society.“I doubt that, not with his record and his attitude,” said Judge Kelly.She added Chestnut could not distinguish between a toilet and a set of shelves.“There could have been some wee cratur lting what they needed and he didn’t care.

They visited a mix of work-based credit unions and community credit unions to provide much-needed technical assistance, especially in rural districts of the Bwiam region.The technical assistance provided by Rosaleen and the coaches included providing support to Gambian credit union staff on day-to-day operations, loan management and credit control.Following each credit union visit Rosaleen and Michael had the opportunity to meet with their Boards and put forward recommendations on how to further develop their credit union .Rosaleen and the coaches also organised for a meeting with local taxi drivers to discuss the potential of them setting up their own credit union.At the end of the visits the coaches hosted a two-day workshop for credit union personnel in Banjul. This allowed for the coaches to discuss credit union issues and share their knowledge with the participants.Rosaleen presented on the topic of governance to the participants.Throughout the two weeks Rosaleen and her fellow volunteers were able to share their skills and knowledge to build the capacity of the credit union personnel in The Gambia and empower them to further strengthen their movement.Rosaleen also had the opportunity to meet credit union members and hear about how the credit union is making a real dference in their lives.The Irish credit union movement is highly regarded across the world and the visit by the Irish coaches was hugely appreciated by the credit union movement in The Gambia.Speaking about her visit, Rosaleen said: “I would like to take the opportunity to thank the members of Newington Credit Union who have supported the ILCU Foundation for many years.“To be able to visit one of the countries which benefit from our support and come back and share my experience enables me to highlight the needs of small rural communities who live in abject poverty.“In facing such conditions the people remain cheerful and are always smiling – hence the name given to The Gambia: the Smiling Coast of Africa. The Gambian credit union volunteers and staff are so keen to enhance their knowledge and skills to develop their credit unions and I hope in the coming years they go from strength to strength.“I would like to thank my fellow coaches, the ILCU Foundation and NACCUG who helped make the trip so successful. ”Baboucarr Jeng, General Manager NACCUG, expressed his thanks to Rosaleen and the coaches for giving their time to help the credit unions in The Gambia and he emphasised the need for the participants “to use the education from the training to develop their skills and the credit unions they represent”.Alan Moore, CEO ILCU Foundation, added: “It has been great to have Rosaleen on board for our coaching programme for the past two years, she has been a fantastic ambassador for the ILCU Foundation and indeed the wider Irish credit union movement.“Throughout the course of her time in The Gambia, our partner credit unions have learnt a great deal from Rosaleen and her fellow coaches.“We are very grateful to Rosaleen for giving up her time to volunteer to help our partners, who, like Rosaleen, know the value of having a credit union and what it means for the members.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Newington Credit Union who supported Rosaleen to participate in the Coaching Programme and for their continued support to the ILCU Foundation’s work.”Newington Credit Union.- Duncairn Gardens,Belfast,BT GF.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"irsp claim psni are intimidating families","story":"AN IRSP member who says he is followed by the PSNI daily has accused police of attempting to “intimidate” party activists.Lower Falls man Michael Kelly was one of a number of IRSP members who were searched by the PSNI as they arrived for a meeting at Costello House earlier thismonth.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mr Kelly reiterated his parties claims that PSNI are involved in “political policing”, and accused police of harassing party members and their families.“I have been getting stalked – it’s every day,” he said.“There are days when it’s worse than others, but there are comrades who get it far worse than myself.“We have a member in St James’ and the cops have a patrol outside his house every morning when he is going to work and bringing kids to school. When he comes back there will be another jeep sitting there or another car sitting there, sometimes marked sometimes unmarked.“This week he was going to get his child from a school event and they stopped him. He pleaded his case that he was running late to pick up his kids and the PSNI boot-boys told him he would stay as long as they ‘saw fit’.“A few weeks ago, I went to pick my son up and I was pulled over and the man said ‘are you in a hurry, Mr Kelly ’ I said I had to pick up my son and told him to get on with whatever he was doing. Again they said ‘you’ll be here as long as we want’. I was there for about ten minutes and I was late to pick up my son.“It’s not just political activists who experience what this brings, it’s also our families – our kids and our partners. Our partners are being intimidated. Two years ago I was approached by MI on the Grosvenor and they followed my partner as she was bringing my daughter to crèche.“The try to intimidate our family members when we’re not there. It’s clear that the ‘reformed’ police service, as they are called by those who work alongside them, are only accommodating to those who tow the line of the establishment. Those who stand in opposition to the British police force in Ireland are fair game, and that also extends to our families.”He continued: “It’s no coincidence that this attempt at criminalising the republican socialist movement, it is starting to rise again when our party is starting to grow and we are doing fantastic work in Belfast.“It will fail today as it has done over the  years of the existence of our party. It will continue to be rejected by those on the ground who we work on behalf of.”The Andersonstown News has contacted the PSNI over the IRSP’s claims and is awaiting a response."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"trade unionist movement launch in belfast","story":"A NEW trade union movement say unionist workers must be heard in the debate on ending Irish partition.Trade Unionists for a New and United Irelandcomprises more than  trade union officials, including a number of general secretaries.Having unveiled the movement in Dublin on Monday, the group held their launch in the north on Tuesday morning at Belfast’s Linen Hall Library.TUNUI want to advocate for reunication and convince the trade unions in Ireland to adopt a pro-unity stance.Spokesman Ruairi Creaney, from the Communication Workers Union, said that a conference being organised by TUNUI in Dublin in April would devote part of the programme to addressing unionist concerns.“I don’t think the unionist working class are as afraid of this issue as the media and others make it out to be,” he said.“It is patronising and dismissive of our unionist brothers and sisters.

I am a leader there with the youth group.\"Reflecting on his childhood, the player said there is a \"certain expectation placed on the children of ministers, but that he \"enjoyed\" the experience as he \"always had somewhere to live, a community to be part of\".\"But there is also the other side of it - youre expected to be this perfect child and when you dont live up to the ideal it results in rumours and I was always aware of that,\" he said.

He was well-known and much-loved in this city’s dance music circles and there is no doubt that Derry ravers who cut their teeth on the dancefloors of the North West would have styled it out to his uplting house music. In the days when the Troubles were still raging, Protestants and Catholics started to come together having found a dferent kind of religion in dance music and Hurley’s pulpit was the DJ box.Chris took the ‘Barn’ in Kelly’s, Portrush, where a meagre  or  punters turned up for his first ‘Club Night’ and, within weeks, transformed it into a heaving success with , dance music lovers from Derry and all over the North turning up every week to make it an unbridled success.The Point Inn just over the border in Quigley’s Point, Donegal, was another club – a place of the stuff of legends for Derry ravers – where they went in their droves while Chris stood smiling at the decks.Derry DJs, promoters, those with fond memories of their raving youth and those who continued to enjoy Chris’ music over the years, shared their shock, disbelief and sadness following the news of his death on February .Charlie Dillon, also known as DJ Bill-X, believes it is only fitting that Derry’s dance music community, of which Chris was a huge part, should pay tribute to the man who has been hailed a ‘pioneer’ and ‘legend’ of the Irish dance music scene.“I met Chris in the early s, I had been working in Kelly’s nightclub when I was a student in Portrush,” he said.“Chris had only started doing nights in the famous Barn - within a few weeks he was catapulted into playing packed houses and bringing guest DJs from all over the UK. Chris was one of the reasons I started to DJ myself. He was a very modest and witty fella, but he knew his music inside and out and stuck to the type of music that he wanted to play, he DJed all over Ireland and the UK. A few years ago we were very lucky to get into guest DJ at our re-rub nights.“Chris was a true pioneer and was the godfather of house in Northern Ireland and his legacy will live on. My thoughts and prayers are with the Hurley family and his little daughter, Scarlett.”Derry DJ, Paul Moran, better known in music circles as DJ Paul P, described Chris as an ‘innovator’ and a ‘legend’.“I first met Chris in  when I clamoured over the DJ box in Kelly’s to ask him to be our guest DJ at new night we were starting in the Point Inn,” he said.“Thankfully he agreed and the rest as they say is history. Our paths crossed many times over the intervening years. I will always remember Chris as an innovator, a DJ of principal who would not compromise his musical style to please the masses.“Chris set the bar high for all others that would follow. He was a real gentleman and a legend of Irish dance music. He will be sorely missed and his legacy will live long in the hearts of the thousands of people who were lucky enough to attend Kellys in the early days of the rave - a magical time made by Chris Hurley.”“He was definitely at the forefront of a le changing movement - a movement that helped break down religious and sectarian barriers during the dark years of Northern Irelands Troubles.”Another of the city’s home-grown talents, DJ Darren McMenamin said Chris was an inspiration to him and set him on the path to do what he truly loves.“Although I was into dance house music around the late s early s, it wasn’t until  and my first visit to Kelly’s, witnessing one of Chris Hurley’s now legendary all night DJ sets, that I even considered the thought of being a DJ,” he said.“Up on the Decks, top off, , people eating out of the palm of his hand...hanging on every tune! Everyone focused on him. I was instantly drawn into the scene.“After going week in, week out, for a few months, the Point Inn opened on Sundays with Chris at the helm. I was there the first night and didn’t take long to be over chatting to Chris about music and some general trainspotting on my behalf.“He was always generous with his time and knowledge and a true inspiration for me and many like me. After a couple of years raving I then went on to become a DJ myself and anytime I ran into Chris he always had time for chat and always showed me a lot of respect.“In more recent years we spoke a lot through Facebook and he invited me along to play at his Barn -year reunions in Sandino’s which was a real honour.“He was a gentleman and a true pioneer of the dance music scene and will be sorely missed.”Stephen Porter from Derry-based dance organisation Jika Jika, said Chris had the ability to unite people through his music: “We were very shocked and saddened to hear the news about Chris illness.“I was lucky to have got to know Chris over the years and he was always an inspirational figure to me and someone I looked up to greatly. His passion for music was infectious and his mannerisms would make you feel at ease.“His legacy is that of someone that brought a war-torn country together through music and firmly established dance music in NI. Deepest sympathies to all Chris friends and family.”While Ann Harley, Proprietor of Sandino’s, said: “Chris ran our Saturday nights for almost a year in . I had missed the Kelly’s Barn years, so didn’t realise at the time how well known and respected he was.“He put  per cent into every night he ran for us ,best DJs, classy posters and flyers, great attention to detail. Apart from that, from the start, he just fitted in and became a friend to a lot of us. Can’t believe we won’t see him again, as everyone says, a proper gentleman.

Not least from Chris’ dear friends.Mark Mc Dermott from Dungiven said he was honoured to have been his close friend: “To me, Chris Hurley was the epitome of a gentleman, kindness, the most great friend, and musician. Also the epitome of class but so humble at the same time. To know him well was a true honour. He was such an inspiration to me in all angles of le and he helped me in more ways than he will ever know. “Chris had talent to burn as a DJ from such a young age and was a pioneer in music, the first to create the house music dance scene in Ireland that will forever be remembered as the Love Years, aptly named as he not only bridged the religious ide at the time with music but he brought all the youth together. He was a living legend but his legend will forever live on in my heart, and the hearts of many.“Gone but never ever forgotten - the Godfather of House, but most importantly my dearest friend and brother in spirit.”Hector McLennan, a dance music promoter from Strabane who has passed the genes onto his own daughter, celebrated Ibiza club DJ, Loéca, paid a heartfelt tribute to ‘the Godfather of House’.“Chris Hurleys name is synonymous with the introduction, development and explosion of dance music in Ireland,” he said.“He has earned a permanent place in the history of our dance culture. He was Northern Irelands godfather of house. Im not saying that he was the only one, there were others who played their part, but he was definitely at the forefront of a le changing movement - a movement that helped break down religious and sectarian barriers during the dark years of Northern Irelands Troubles.“Chris had the tunes that every DJ wanted. Ive often been in situations with people in the music business and we would hear a tune. One of us would always say, \"That was a big Chris Hurley tune.\" Like DJs of his time, his message was spread through DJ Mix Tapes. What car didnt have a Chris Hurley tape back in the day “Over the last few years I enjoyed some great nights with Chris. We reminisced about the good old days and we hit it off because we were both excited about the current house music scene. Stand out moments include driving to Portrush after Sven Vath in Eglinton to hear Chris in Portrush with John Morrison on tow, a mad Paddys weekend in Portrush in  and of course having him as a guest in Sugar on a night co-promoted with Jika Jika. His love and passion for House Music had never faltered. He didnt want to re-live his success of the past but was still an innovator pushing out the barriers and seeking out those fresh new sounds.“I will always remember Chris for his love and passion for House Music. Chris Hurley, thank you for the memories.”\"He was erudite, intelligent and so so passionate about his music...he led from the front and was key to the start of the dance scene in Northern Ireland, a movement that would have a huge role in changing attitudes and lives.\"Neal McClelland, DJ and Presenter at Downtown Radio and Cool FM, also paid his respects recognising how powerful Chris’ music was in turbulent times: “Chris was an innovator and total gentleman that loved the groove and helped shape the wave of rave that swept across our country and created the bridge between two religions that paved the path for the future through music.”Darren Drake, DJ and good friend, said: “Chris was a devoted father, a loving son, brother and uncle. Ever since our first meeting, in those halcyon days of the house music revolution of the early s, of which he was a true pioneer, Chris Hurley has been, and forever shall be, my inspiration and my friend.”Ray McLaughlin, also known as DJ X-Ray: “Chris paved the way for a whole new generation of DJs some of us wouldnt still be DJing todayit wasnt for his vision in the early s.”Glen Molly said he wished Chris could have been there for the th anniversary of the Barn: “The  years of the Barn was missing him,” he said, “I would really have loved him to have played it.”Timmy Stewart, a DJ from Belfast and close friend to Chris, said: “I loved the fact Chris was so upfront with his music.“We had heard Secret Knowledge’s ‘Sugar Daddy’ played on the Essential Selection one Friday night and he played a white label of it the very next night. I always felt privileged to be exposed to that level of cutting edge music especially at that age and time.”Col Hamilton, Promoter at Lush! Official , paid this tribute on behalf of the club where Chris first burst onto the scene: “We were saddened to hear the news of the passing of original Kelly’s resident DJ Chris Hurley.“Back in early  when Kelly’s Barn was a live band and rock venue, the late James Kelly let a young local lad start a Saturday ‘Club Night’, the rest, as they say, is history. Chris Hurley started with about  people on the first night and within six months was attracting thousands of clubbers from across the North and Donegal flocking to hear the latest UK European house music. To say he started a legacy would be only fair and Lush! would not be here  years later as one of the UK’s leading venues without Chriss original vision.“We would like to take this opportunity to extend our condolences to His Family circle and his young daughter. Until we meet again, old friend.”Liverpool DJ, Steve Vertigo, said a phone call in  from Chris went on to ‘open the door on a magical Northern Irish adventure that has rumbled on for  years’.\"When I met him we shared similar hairand were both bang in the middle of an incredible love affair with house music,\" he said.\"That first night waiting in the Barn for it to open with hundreds of people outside banging on the walls chanting Let us in!” like some sort of fantastic zombie survival film was only a hint of the craziness to come. That first booking turned into a friendship and many repeat visits hanging out for days after gigs in Portrush with Chris and Joanne. He was erudite, intelligent and so so passionate about his music. Always ready with a laugh and a plan and an appetite for good old-fashioned fun. He led from the front and was key to the start of the dance scene in Northern Ireland, a movement that would have a huge role in changing attitudes and lives.\"In  I played one last time with him in the main room at Kelly’s, a reunion and a waypoint on a long journey that now feels so short. It brought back memories of beautul, messy hazy times in Portrush when we were all young and had no idea how big this dream of utopia would grow.\"Ill remember his smile and the way hed look you up and down, head tilted slightly back as hed work out whether you were talking rubbish and how he was going to wind you up.

I had an amazing time there the teachers were so supportive and Miss ODoherty in P.E taught me so many le lessons between reminding me to tie my shoelaces so I wouldnt trip again”.And…“I wasn’t musical in school I was told I was actually tone deaf which knocked my confidence for years and I didnt think about music until I went to university in Leeds.\"I always wrote poetry and stories, it was a way to escape the noise of the world and create a safer world to be in and after I started putting the words to music they started coming to le and took on new energy. I met a producer in Leeds called Mike Brown and he helped me record my first two singles, ‘Autumn Sky’ and ‘Free’ ”.Then what ...\"These songs helped get me the opportunity to go back to Zimbabwe and there I ended up shooting the video for ‘Autumn Sky’, as well as collaborating with chart topping African artists including Dhadza D, Tehn Diamond and more.\"Im lucky that music allowed me to travel and Ive performed across Africa including Malawi, Tanzania, South Africa and more.

The method used to calculate payments is unfair, reliant on employers reporting wages on time and can lead to massive rental debts.“Universal Credit replaced a host of benefits including Working Tax Credit and Housing Benefit, and some families on the new benefit are beginning to witness its pitfalls. Working Tax Credit payments were based on expected earnings for the year, whereas Universal Credit payments are based on earnings reported to HMRC in the previous month.“Working in Colum Eastwood’s constituency office in Northside, we are contacted on a weekly basis by people receiving no Universal Credit payments due to inaccurate or late reporting of their wages to HMRC.“If wages are reported late then Universal Credit payments can be affected. It all comes down to the Assessment Period, the month long period preceding payment which is used to calculate entitlement to Universal Credit.“We’ve had countless incidents where employers have reported wages late which resulted in two monthly wages going into one Assessment Period, giving the impression of massive monthly earnings. This has led to no Universal Credit payment the following month.“The flip side is that there will then be a preceding Assessment Period with no wages reported which leads to an inflated Universal Credit payment. It all financially balances out over the two-month period but it makes it very dficult for families to budget.“But the critical and most worrying aspect is the impact on Housing Costs. Most people on Universal Credit get help with Housing Costs which goes directly to the landlord, the equivalent of the old Housing Benefit system.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“In a month where no wages are reported they get an inflated Universal Credit payment with Housing Costs paid directly to the landlord. In a month where two wages are reported, they get no Universal Credit payment and the landlord receives no rent.“The Universal Credit payments balance out over two months but the landlord only receives one months rent, leaving the claimant in rent arrears.“One real le example is where a young Derry mother’s employer reported wages ten days late and she now owes her landlord nearly £ in rent. Had the wages been reported on time, she would owe her landlord nothing.“The sad reality is thatyour employer reports your wages late to HMRC that it could cost you a months rent.“We’ve asked Universal Credit to recalculate monthly payments and Housing Costs based on the dates employees were actually paid, but theyve said the system doesnt allow for this.“The system must change. Entitlement to Universal Credit must be calculated on actual monthly income, not calculated on when it was reported to HMRC.”“The SDLP voted against all aspects of Welfare Reform. Universal Credit is wreaking havoc on our society and it should be scrapped. In the absence of that, the British Government must take decisive action to make it fairer system for all.”CAPTION: SDLP candidate Rory Farrell."},{"url":null,"title":"singer niamh mcglinchey perform walled city market","story":"Those attending this weekend’s Walled City Market are in for a musical treat as rising country star Niamh McGlinchey will be performing live at the event.The Market s to Guildhall Square this Saturday March nd from am-pm and Niamh will be performing on the day from pm-pm.The popular food and craft market is organised by Derry City and Strabane District Council and takes place on the first Saturday of the month every month.The market offers a wide range of speciality food traders with fresh breads, vegetables, meat, homemade jams and preserves as well as handcrafted products such as textiles and paintings.Nicolle Walters, Market Development Officer with Derry City and Strabane District Council said she was pleased to be offering musical entertainment along with the usual offering of some of the finest locally produced food and craft products.“We are delighted to be able to add to the atmosphere in Guildhall Square with a live performance from Niamh McGlinchey who is one of the most in demand country performers on the circuit.“The stalls open from am to pm and offer a wide range of top quality fresh produce at affordable prices.“We also have street food and a wide range of locally produced craft products for sale soyou are out and about on Saturday make sure and come along.”Hailing from Gulladuff in County Derry, Niamh started her days as a folk singer and earned an All Ireland medal in solo singing.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshShe has made a number of high profile appearances including singing the anthem at Croke Park and appearing on RTE’s All Ireland Talent Show and TG’s Glor Tire and Opry Le Daniel,She has spent the last six years touring the UK, Ireland and America alongside artists such as Nathan Carter, Derek Ryan, Bagatelle and the Irish Dance Spectacular “TitanicDance.”Later in March she will be performing in the renowned Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, so be sure to pop by and enjoy this songbird’s performance before she take’s flight.Among the traders at the Walled City Market will be well known local company Doherty’s Meats who will be serving a selection of their award winning street food including beef burgers, hot dogs and Derry Stew made with their Special Mince.Other traders at Saturday’s Market will be: Windy City Baking Company, Granny Knitter, CM’s Pantry, Living Crystal, Willow Studios, Curry Sauce NI, Amara Dexter Cattle, Crepes N Coffee, Watercolours By Noeleen, Keltic Slates, Rainbow Tie-Dye, No  Creations, Doorish Art  Crafts, Bake N Joy, Coffee  Cream, So Skincare and Simply Irresistible, La Tia Juanas.Anyone interesting in finding out more about trading at the market are asked to contact Nicolle at [email#protected] or Tel:  .For further information visit www.derrystrabane Subsites Walled-City-Market Welcome.Find us on Facebook at www.facebook whatsonderrystrabane  or follow us on Twitter @Walledmarket."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wMlxcXC8yNjEzNTk1MFxcXC9Ccmlhbi1UaWVybmV5LW5ldy5wbmdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC9jYWNoZS5yZXNpemVkLmNvXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJmYWRkYzFmMTA2YjIzOTQ1NzFhYjIzYjBjZGZlNjNlNzdhNDE3M2EwIn0=/brian-tierney-new.png","title":"tierney welcomes buncrana road upgrade public information day","story":"The Department of Infrastructure is to hold another public information day on the proposed A Buncrana Road dualling scheme.The news has been welcomed by SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCllr Tierneysaid: “At a public meeting convened by the SDLP on th May , residents were able to air their concerns to engineers with regards to the proposed dualling of Buncrana Road and some of its impacts on the local community. “Officials from the Department and ARUP Consultants listened to concerns and undertook towith revised drawings aimed at addressing some of the issues raised.“We have continued to lobby with the Department for Infrastructure and are pleased that a date for another Public Information Day has been set for Tuesday th March, Da Vinci’s Hotel. “We are hopeful that residents’ concerns and suggestions will be reflected in the new plans.

It is not a satisfactory situation.Mr Billy McGivern, the Executiversquos area manager, admitted to councillors he was not happy with the situation in Ballynahinch and explained what had gone wrong with the Antrim Road site where  new homes were to have been built.ldquoWe did get planning permission for the site, he said. ldquoWe dug trial holes and the ground was satisfactory, but we were overtaken by discussions between the landowner and a private developer. The Housing Executive could not go through with a vesting order where a private developer is going ahead to build low cost housing.Mr McGivern promised that the Executive would press very strongly for sites in Ballynahinch and would be meeting with local planners in an attempt to come up with an answer.Ballynahinch councillor Mr Eddie McVeigh agreed there were problems obtaining sites, but he pointed out that the town was not scheduled for any new homes until - and he wanted other sites investigated as soon as possible.Cllr William Brown felt the now abandoned Antrim Road site was not all it was supposed to be anyway and it would have been foolish to proceed with a site which would have flooded, as it had done in the past.Cllr Francis Laverty wanted to know how the Executive could justy giving houses in Ballynahinch to people from Drumaness.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick firemen had another busy week, during which they attended several gorse fires and a chimney fire.On Saturday they were called to a gorse fire near Irish Street and the previous day they attended a Gorse Fire at Gallows Hill.On Thursday they were called out three times. The first was in the morning to St Johnrsquos Old Peoplersquos Home in Pound Lane, but they were not needed as the fire alarm had gone off accidentally.KILLOUGH mdash Killough Village Committee is pressing the Housing Executive to repair extensive storm damage caused to houses during the Christmas period.Damage caused to several of the new houses in the Castle Street area was one of the main problems discussed at a meeting of the committee recently.ldquoSerious storm damage to the roofs occurred, especially over the Christmas period, and this has not been fixed, the committee claims.ldquoLetters were sent to the Housing Executive and the contractor. The Executive sent a clerk of works to meet the contractorrsquos men at an arranged time, but they didnrsquot turn up, the committee said.ldquoThe occupants are very annoyed about this lack of interest and are now awaiting immediate action before dampness causes more serious damage.The committee has also hit out at the delay in truing to prove the ownership of the village harbour. They say it has ldquogone beyond a joke and intend sending a delegation to Down Council in a bid of finally resolve the ownership question.ldquoNothing can be done to start work on the sadly neglected harbour area until the present owner is contacted and public ownership is established. We firmly intend to pursue this matter until work has begun, the committee added.In the evening they attended a gorse fire on the Saul Road and several hours later they attended a chimney fire at Bobbie Hanveyrsquos photographic shop in Irish Street.ARDGLASS mdash Local planners have been asked to keep watch on a dredging operation currently underway at Ardglass harbour.The call has come from Down Council chairman Eddie McGrady, who is concerned not so much about the dredging but what is happening to the materials being taken from the harbour.Local councillor Dermot Curran is also concerned. He said that a tipping operation at the rear of the Seaview estate has not been properly maintained mdash much to the disgust of residents.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Three pupils from Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have won a Raleigh Boxer bicycle in a national lsquoWheels Projectrsquo open to Tufty Clubs.The bicycle, which will be used by the Tufty Club members at the school, was the top price in the - years section of the competition which was organised by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents.Members of the schoolrsquos Tufty Club entered the competition, but it was the entries of Jason McKeown, Paul Beattie and Paul Chambers that clinched the top prize.COMBER mdash Comber police are investigating a number of thefts which took place in the town over the past week.Thieves entered the Rle Club in Railway Street and took away away a number of bottles of spirits on Wednesday evening.

We really are in need of fund raising from the public to help keep us going.Glebe House manager Diarmaid McGarrigle blames the rise in student overheads as one reason for the shortage of dedicated volunteers, calling it a ldquopoor indictment on our society.Mr McGarrigle said up until a few years ago Glebe House benefited from a ldquoteam of dedicated, driven and enthusiastic helpers.He said that is no longer the case because students were now having to seek paid employment to cover tuition fees and other costs.ldquoIt is a shame because young groups need volunteers from their own peer group to relate to, he explained.ldquoWe can offer volunteers a wide iety of skills to choose from as we have  acres of farm land, animals to look after and an environment to plan and maintain. We also run lots of arts and crafts, cookery and games-centred projects.ldquoAll we are looking for in a volunteer is someone who is dedicated to the aims and objectives of Glebe House and its projects.ldquoInthey will receive training in which ever area they choose to work, a lot of camaraderie and the opportunity to meet new friends.ldquoOne of the most rewarding aspects of working at Glebe House for me is seeing children we have helped come back as volunteers years later.

The centrepiece of the celebrations was a specially baked cake.Mrs Hilman has seen huge changes over the past four decades, including progressing from a manual typewriter and maintaing a hand written register to a state-of-the art computer system with touch-type keyboards and scanners.However, one thing that remains the same is the children, who are as much an inspiration today as they were when she first walked into the school.Mrs Hilman began working as secretary in  when Mr James McIlhinney was the principal.

He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals.

Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK.

Now the department says that supposed temporary fix of the scheme was itself wildly over-generous and is proposing an entirely new approach.In the meantime, the department has been incapable of doing what to the person in the street would be the most obvious way to root out fraud – inspect every boiler.More than three years after the scheme closed, the department cannot even be certain that all of the boilers it has been subsidising actually exist because neither it nor its agents have ever been to see them – even though there are just over ,, and many of those involve multiple boilers at a single site.But there are reasons to be particularly wary of what the department published yesterday. There is no question that the original scheme set up by Arlene Foster was wildly over-generous. The boiler owners challenging that decision in court are attempting to establish that it should be reinstated. But eventhey persuade the court that they have a legal entitlement to uncapped ‘burn as you earn’ tarfs there is a moral argument for them to voluntarily agree to a less lucrative scheme. Those who refused to do so could be named, leaving them open to the verdict of the public.But, having overseen a scheme which was absurd in both economic and environmental terms, the department now seems to havegone to the other extreme.The logic of the subsidy now proposed is that the department thinks this is how the scheme should have looked at the outset. But the whole point of RHI was to be an incentive.Would a payment of £, – spread  years into the future – really persuade someone to install a biomass boiler costing up to £,, with additional hassle, higher maintenance bills and the uncertainty of a new technology If civil servants think that, they are out of step with what is happening where in Europe. Payments on the GB scheme are vastly above what Stormont is now proposing.And the scheme about to be launched in the Republic – in a desperate late bid to stave off infraction proceedings because it has been so slow to phase out fossil fuels – is also lucrative.A comparison drawn up by the RHANI lobby group shows comparative payments of over £, for GB claimants with a kw boiler installed before July , £, for someone entering the GB scheme today and £, for someone entering the Irish scheme when it launches later this year.If, as Stormont claims, anything beyond £, a year in Northern Ireland is illegal state aid, then the European Commission needs to investigate those other schemes – otherwise Northern Ireland firms are at a disadvantage.Vast cut to -year RHI subsidy will see payments collapse Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"This plan needs rigorous scrutiny, which cannot happen by MLAs without an Assembly.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
