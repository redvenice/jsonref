The musical remake of her 1980s film that she leaves behind is proficient, but soulless.

The central trio of secretaries (originally Parton, Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda on screen) start the fight within their firm for equal rights and recognition.Worthy causes, but they’re quickly forgotten as cleavages are ogled, unattractive women are balked at, secretary Bonnie Langford kicks her height in suspenders and boss Brian Conley is dangled from the ceiling in a gimp suit.

Davies is far better than her Love Island career start would have you expect, Sheen is solid West End standard, but McQueen as Doralee (unmistakably the rootin’-tootin’ Dolly Parton role) is the closest thing to stardust with fine Tennessee-twang vocal cords and a Barbara Windsor slapstick quality.

The Mail has obtained a copy of a ‘restraint order prohibiting disposal of assets’ served on him by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The order threatens him with a fine or jail if he tries to sell his multi-million-pound homes or cherished fleet of supercars.Over 17 pages, the restraint order freezes no fewer than 14 bank accounts, and bans the sale of his Lamborghinis, Rolls-Royces and Bentleys, and seven property deeds. The order was issued by Judge Sarah Munro QC, sitting at the Old Bailey, on August 29. The hearing was private, and was not reported at the time. When the Mail tried to report on the existence of the order last December, Stunt’s lawyers obtained a court order that banned publication.          Stunning views: The block of flats overlooking the Thames in Chelsea Harbour          Luxury home: The cottage in Belgravia that was on the market in 2016 for £11.8mBut Stunt’s bid to gag the Press has backfired, after the Mail challenged the gagging order in court yesterday. It was overturned, meaning the Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings against the multi-millionaire can be revealed for the first time. The Act was introduced in 2002 to allow money or assets to be seized by the State if they were obtained through unlawful conduct. In Stunt’s case, he has not been charged with any offence, and it is not clear why the order has been made. His assets have not been seized, but their use has been restricted and he must not dispose of, deal with or diminish the value of them.It is understood that, since August, the restraint order has been subject to minor revisions on three occasions, to take account of Stunt’s business interests.In the original order, Judge Munro QC slapped a £1,000-a-week limit on him, saying: ‘This order does not prohibit the Alleged Offender from spending up to £1,000 a week towards his ordinary living expenses.’          Listed by the court: One of two Rolls-Royce Phantoms. Stunt recently bragged of owning 200 cars and boasted that losing £5million in a casino meant nothing to him.          Stunt is being forced to live considerably more frugally these days – on the orders of a judge (pictured: His favourite supercar, the Lamborghini Aventador)It is a far cry from his days of splashing the cash. His costly and acrimonious orce from Miss Ecclestone in 2017 did not dent his penchant for shopping trips to Harrods in a cavalcade of supercars. In March last year, he declared to Tatler magazine that he is ‘as rich as ever’.He said he had once had a £5million credit line at ‘every casino’ in London, Monaco, Las Vegas and Macao but had recently cut his wagers to ‘just’ £20,000 a night, explaining: ‘Me fooling around with £20,000, I’m not trying to sound as if I don’t know the value of money, but it’s a huge improvement on losing £5million a night. You have to bet enough to hurt you, but I definitely had a gambling problem. I was losing millions every time.’Interviewed at home by the high-society magazine, while wearing a £60,000 Audemars Piguet gold wristwatch, he showed off some of his paintings including a Van Gogh, a Constable, a Picasso and several Van Dycks.These are likely to be among the list of artworks that Stunt has been ordered to draw up by the court. The judge demanded he itemise all of his ‘paintings, furniture, watches, jewellery and objets d’art’, along with their estimated value, photographs and locations where they are held.          Audemars Piguet gold watch: Stunt has one worth £60,000 in his collection          The gold bullion magnate is the ex-husband of Formula One heiress Petra Ecclestone, with whom he has three children (pictured: His Bentley Mulsanne)          Rolls-Royce Phantom: The other in Stunt’s collection. Stunt has also spent millions on artworksStunt has spent millions on artworks. His bodyguards have been spotted carrying bubble-wrapped masterpieces from Sotheby’s and Christie’s to Rolls-Royces parked on yellow lines outside.He has lent paintings by Monet, Dali, Picasso and Constable to galleries around the world. Even Prince Charles accepted paintings on loan for the restoration of his Scottish stately home Dumfries House, and Stunt has several royal letters of gratitude on display at his Mayfair office.Two months ago, in line with good journalistic practice, the Mail gave Stunt a chance to comment before publication. A security guard answering the door of his stucco-fronted Belgravia cottage said he was unavailable, but accepted a letter to him offering an opportunity to comment. Instead of doing so, Stunt went straight to a judge.Later that day, Old Bailey Judge Mark Dennis QC granted an order to ‘prohibit publication of all information’ relating to the assets freezing order. Yesterday, Judge Dennis threw out the gagging order, and suggested Stunt had been trying to protect his ‘personal, reputational or personal business interests’, none of which was relevant to the Proceeds of Crime proceedings. The CPS has declined to comment.          Used by his security team: One of two Range Rovers. He told Tattler he liked to travel in ‘an armada of cars’ on shopping trips round London          Bentley Flying Spur: Stunt claims to own 200 carsStunt has repeatedly stoked controversy. During his £5billion orce, he was claimed to have rubbed cocaine on his gums during a court hearing. On the same day in June 2017, it is also claimed he barged into his father-in-law, the ex-Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone, and made a gun gesture towards him in court. He later made an obscene gesture at photographers as he left the hearing. Stunt has ‘categorically denied’ all these allegations, calling them ‘completely ridiculous’.Around that time, Stunt was photographed sitting in the back of a Rolls-Royce with Terry Adams, the ‘Godfather’ of Britain’s most notorious crime family which has been linked to 25 murders, money laundering, racketeering and extortion.Adams is also Stunt’s godfather. Stunt has spoken of his pride at being his godson. There is no suggestion he is involved in any of Adams’s affairs.          Wine collection: A bottle of Chateau PetrusThe assets which have been frozen by the court offer a fascinating glimpse into Stunt’s wealth. Among other things, the Proceeds of Crime order lists his cars and their personalised number plates – all variations on his surname.Supercars Stunt is banned from selling the following cars: Bentley Flying Spur, registration S4UNT Range Rover S2UNT Lamborghini Countach 157UNT Rolls-Royce Phantom 57UNT, Lamborghini Aventador S7UNT, Range Rover S1UNT, Rolls-Royce Phantom S3UNT, Lamborghini Aventador S1VNT, Bentley Mulsanne S6UNT.He has bragged that he owns more than 200 high-performance cars, mainly stored in hangars in California and the UK.He told Tattler he liked to travel in ‘an armada of cars’ on shopping trips round London, typically in a Lamborghini sandwiched by two Rolls-Royces and two Range Rovers as, he claims, it would embarrass him to have his 25-strong security team trail him in Ford Fiestas.Stunt once boasted to Bernie Ecclestone that his £600,000 Rolls-Royce Mansory Conquistador was the only one in the world.Apartments The court order imposes a freeze on two entire floors of a luxury apartment block next to the Thames. Stunt paid £3.3million for the first flat, in 2012, and a further £3.4million for the apartment directly beneath it, in 2015.Deeds for the two properties, publicly available via the Land Registry, have been recently amended to show that a court order prevents any sale without the permission of ‘the CPS Proceeds of Crime Central Pre-Enforcement Unit’. They also show that a bankruptcy notice was filed at the High Court in October this year.£11m cottage Stunt’s stucco-fronted four-storey Belgravia cottage has four double-bedroom suites, wine cellar, roof terrace, cinema, gym and steam room. Bought via one of his companies for £2.7million in 2011 – he boasted he paid cash – it was put back on the market in 2016 for £11.8million but did not sell.          The court order also demanded that Stunt draw up a list of all his art. Pictured is one of his entourage on an art-buying spree in July 2015 Land Two small plots in Stunt’s name close to Dartmouth Castle in Devon are identified in the order. Bizarrely, the plots in a patch of woodland are tiny – each less than eight inches by eight inches.MoneyThe order freezes no fewer than 14 bank accounts in the names of James Stunt or Stunt \u0026amp Co Ltd. They comprise nine accounts at Barclays, four at Lloyds and one at a Mayfair wealth management firm.WineStunt is banned from selling his Corney \u0026amp Barrow fine wine collection. The 230-year-old London-based firm is one of the oldest independent wine merchants in the UK. It is currently selling a case of 12 bottles of Petrus 1982 for £51,000.Art The court order also demanded that Stunt draw up a list of all his ‘paintings, furniture, watches, jewellery and objets d’art’ and itemise their estimated value and locations where they are held."},{"url":null,"title":"Shamima Begums baby taken Loose Womens Denise Welch tells viewers","story":"Denise Welch (right) has waded into the jihadi schoolgirl controversy by saying her baby should be taken off her, while Gemma Atkinson (left)  says the jihadi schoolgirl should not be allowed back into the UK          They are the latest celebrities to offer their views on 19-year-old Shamima Begum (pictured) who is begging to return home after fleeing to Syria to join the Islamic State in 2015She said: \u0027I do believe the baby should be taken from her and I believe the baby should be placed with a family that has nothing to do with that family.\u0027  And the star went on to say the runaway schoolgirl has shown \u0027no remorse\u0027 and was \u0027still in love\u0027 with her jihadi husband. Jihadi bride Shamima Begum says she is willing to go to JAIL...Share this articleOther panelists disagreed with the ex-Coronation Street actress, including singer Gabrielle who supported the ISIS schoolgirl\u0027s cause.She said: \u0027We are a humane country - we should have her back.

The report indicated radiation levels were at 800 millirems per hour on contact with the ore           The canyon is viewed at sunrise from the South Rim on February 8. The allegations center around containers with uranium stored in the national park\u0027s museum collection Stephenson added that one of the buckets was so full that it was brimming with uranium and its lid would not close.  In a separate email to David Bernhardt, acting interior secretary and Deputy Inspector General Mary Kendall, Stephenson said he had asked National Park executives on a number of occasions to inform the public, only to get \u0027stonewalled.\u0027\u0027Respectfully, it was not only immoral not to let Our People know,\u0027 he added, \u0027but I could not longer risk my (health and safety) certification by letting this go any longer,\u0027 he wrote.   In an interview with USA Today, Stephenson said he was assisting with a safety audit when employees told him about the uranium.He then contacted a National Parks specialist in Colorado.          Stephenson said the containers were near a taxidermy exhibit where children on tours sometimes stopped for presentations, sitting near to them for 30 minutes or moreTechnicians traveled to the Grand Canyon several days after his call, on June 18, last year. The technicians came to the park with a Ludlum meter, which also measures radiation output. They didn\u0027t have protective clothing so they used dish-washing and gardening gloves and a broken mop handle to lift the buckets \u0027containing uranium\u0027 into a truck, Stephenson said. Stephenson\u0027s account appears to be corroborated by photographs in a 45-page slideshow intended to document the alleged cover-up. Stephenson said the technicians didn\u0027t tell him what the radiation readings were and dumped the ore into Orphan Mine, an old uranium dig, a few miles away from the Grand Canyon village.            The technicians who traveled to the Canyon after Stephenson\u0027s call to a National Parks specialist in Colorado did not have protective clothing and used a broken mop handle (pictured above) to lift the contaminated buckets into a truck Stephenson said he filed a report with OSHA, which sent inspectors to the museum building in yellow protective suits.He said he could hear the inspectors \u0027meters going off\u0027 and that they detected a low-level site within the building, tracing it to three buckets, which Park Service technicians had returned to the building after dumping their contents. A spokesman for OSHA confirmed an investigation is underway, but didn\u0027t provide any other information.   According to USA Today Stephenson obtained a report submitted by the Park Service\u0027s regional safety manager.The report indicated radiation levels at 13.9 millirems per hour where the containers were stored, and 800 per hour on contact with the ore. However, five feet away from the buckets, there was a zero reading.According to Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a maximum safe dosage for the public, beyond natural radiation, is no more than 2 millirems per hour, or 100 per year.          The report also indicated radiation levels of 800 per hour on contact with the ore, a maximum safe dosage for the public, beyond natural radiation, is no more than 2 millirems per hour The report suggested guidelines for storing geology samples in the future but did not call for the public to be notified.     Emily Davis, a public affairs specialist at the Grand Canyon, said an investigation is underway coordinated by the Park Service, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Arizona Department of Health Services.Davis stressed that a recent review of the building in question uncovered only background radiation, which is natural in the area and is safe.\u0027There is no current risk to the park employees or public,\u0027 Davis said, adding a recent review of the building only uncovered safe background radiation.\u0027The building is open. … The information I have is that the rocks were removed, and there\u0027s no danger,\u0027 she added.Davis wouldn\u0027t comment on Stephenson\u0027s assertion that thousands of people may have been exposed to dangerous levels of radiation, or his allegations that the Park Service violated the law by not issuing a public warning.           Emily Davis, a public affairs specialist at the Grand Canyon, said an investigation is underway and \u0027the rocks were removed and there\u0027s no danger\u0027 or \u0027current risk\u0027 to employees or the publicEXCLUSIVE: Jussie Smollett appeared in a play about a...Share this articleStephenson, who is African-American said the uranium exposure saga at the park developed while he was pursuing a racial-discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity office. This is not the first time Stephenson, who is a military veteran and certified as an occupational safety and health technician, has had a brush with controversy at work.According to court records, while in the navy, he called for action to prevent falls after a series of accidents in 2016. He was fired.

Bright Dead Things, her fourth collection, was shortlisted for the National Book award and feted by Tracy K Smith, the US poet laureate. Limón has been published in the New Yorker and the New York Times. And she is that rare thing – a poet whose work sells.It sells for the same reason that it spoke to me. I was ambushed by her power to move – several poems brought a lump to my throat. Yet her popularity is about more than accessibility. She never hides behind words but reveals herself through them – even when the risk is overexposure. She situates herself in her writing as a figure in a landscape – rural Kentucky – and her struggles (especially with fertility in Carrying) are set against this unheeding pastoral scene. In a recent interview, she said she thought it important that poets should not “just write poems for other poets”. She makes no apology for keeping it simple.The Carrying is her fifth collection and its opening poem, A Name, imagines Eve in the garden of Eden naming the animals “nightingale, red-shouldered hawk, fiddler crab, fallow deer” and then continues: “I wonder if she ever wanted them to speak back, looked into their wide wonderful eyes and whispered, Name me, name me.” I initially balked at “wide wonderful” as Disney adjectives (although might they not also be accurate?) but what matters most is the poem’s directness and what so many of her poems share – an instinctive sense of where and how to end. She knows how to change direction at the last moment, knows an ending can be an elsewhere.The book is full of the importance of naming. In Against Belonging, about a new home defining itself, she writes about how, “With each new name, the world expanded.” In On a Lamppost Long Ago, she writes about languages disappearing and continues: “There are too many things to hold in the palm of the brain. Your father with Alzheimer’s uses the word thing to describe many different nouns and we guess the word he means. When we get it right, he nods as if it’s obvious. When we get it wrong, his face closes like a fist.”Throughout – tacitly underlying all this naming – is, perhaps, an unconceived, longed for, unnamed child. In Mastering, she writes about the hideousness of a friend swanking about his child in her presence. There is an aloneness in this poetry – even in company – and at the same time a generosity in the sharing with readers.What is particularly unusual is that Limón finds an ardour in compromise, making her peace with childlessness and with life’s imperfection. It seems that this period of trying to conceive has pushed her poetry to its limit, that it exists on the frontier between something and nothing. It describes an effortful time that makes these apparently effortless, quick-release poems all the more merciful and beautiful. There is nothing self-indulgent here but there is humorous self-assertion. In Prey she advises: “Don’t be the mouse” – and she isn’t.Part of the pleasure of reading Limón is the way she transports you to a Kentucky punctuated by the noise of trains, the presence of horses, the planting of seeds. She does not ignore the world’s cruelties but tries not to be held hostage by them. This is as-the-crow flies poetry – it goes straight to the heart.• The Carrying by Ada Limón is published by Corsair (£10.99). To order a copy go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

But seeing a similar plot play out in the trailer for Danny Boyle’s new film, Yesterday, came as a shock. “I had high expectations for Enormity’s success,” Milligan said. “I wrote it with a movie in mind.”That goal seems even more out of reach now.Written by Richard Harris and starring Himesh Patel and Lily James, Yesterday follows a character called Jack (Patel) who has a bicycle accident during a worldwide blackout. According to the trailer, which was released last week, when Jack wakes up, he finds himself in an almost identical version of Earth in which The Beatles never existed. He passes off their music as his own, and havoc ensues.It’s a plot that bears remarkable resemblance to the Australian Milligan’s novel, which also follows a character called Jack who, after a journey into deep space, finds himself on a planet that’s almost identical to Earth, with a few exceptions – including that its people have never heard of The Beatles.“He passes off classic music as his own material, including that of The Beatles, and the story then explores the consequences of that lie,” Milligan told  Australia.“The central premise and general exploration of the concept are the same. Both Jacks experience inner turmoil in regard to the lie they’re living and perpetuating,” Milligan said. “They’re both morality tales. Both are satires on the music industry. And the trajectory to superstardom, with Jack performing to a crowded stadium etc, appears to be in both.”But there are differences in tone, Milligan points out.“The tone of both, outside of the central premise, appears quite different. Yesterday is a more light-hearted family-friendly film, where Enormity is far more dark and twisted,” said Milligan. “It’s probably just a horrible coincidence and they mean me no disrespect.”Milligan self-published Enormity in 2013, selling on Amazon. He estimates with giveaways and direct sales, he saw some 20,000 downloads of his book.He chose to self-publish rather than trying to find a traditional publisher because he felt his idea “didn’t quite fit into a particular genre, so it might have been put in the too hard basket” by commercial publishers.“Being an independent author, as I see it, is a long game. You have to be realistic. Rather than a big marketing budget you rely on word of mouth. It’s generally a slower process. Each new novel you write ultimately promotes the previous books. So my expectations have never been of overnight success,” Milligan said.Research from Macquarie University in 2015 showed Australian authors earn only an average of $2,600 per annum from self-publishing genre fiction, the highest-earning area in self-publishing.Since speaking out over the weekend about the similarities between Enormity and Yesterday, Milligan said he has seen a modest spike in sales of his own work.“I honestly feel quite awkward about the whole situation. On one hand it’s amazing that Enormity is finally getting some exposure, but this is not the way I wanted it to happen,” he said.“I hope people don’t read my book expecting it to be a light-hearted romp or a carbon copy of what’s in the trailer.”Australian copyright law protects the expression of an idea but not the idea itself. According to the Australian Copyright Council, the basic plot for a book, television series, film or play, including the characters, is not protected by copyright, but the literary work itself is protected.Grant McAvaney, CEO of the Australian Copyright Council, told  Australia that to prove copyright infringement, one creator would need to prove that the other had taken a material portion of their work. “So that’s not just the idea alone, but it’s the way the idea is explored … by reference to things such as structure, characters, key plot points and language used,” he said.But copyright law also varies across territories and is notoriously complicated. Even a claim pursued in Australia would result in a costly and time-consuming court case, said McAvaney. “Adding an international dimension adds to the cost and the complexity because the courts of different countries will take slightly different approaches to copyright infringement. Even if you win, enforcing that judgment against someone based overseas can be very difficult.”“This is certainly not the first time a writer has felt this way – concerns were raised by the family of a later author about Shape of Water and several authors felt that Avatar drew on their own creations,” McAvaney said.Yesterday is due out in June. Milligan is understood to be seeking legal advice on his situation.The producers of Yesterday, Working Title Films, has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72971993de3b55399ee2eeeadf150fb2ae6c3119/0_288_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33e1321e6209a2853269f9785b934024","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s start with some positivity: BirdsAreGood has been rereading Angela Carter’s Wise Children:And what a book it is chock full of joie de vivre, which makes it extremely poignant when you consider what happened to the author next. A splendid, sometimes surreal, romp devoid of anything even resembling anger or bitterness, it’s one of my very favourite novels. Dora Chance is, also, one of the finest narrative voices in fiction. She (and her twin sis) would almost certainly be the first name(s) on my literary dinner party list. What a joy it is to dance and sing. Thank you, Angela.I’m 100 pages into and head over heels for Middlemarch.James Baldwin has worked similar magic on Veufveuve:For now I’m just going to gush: I think If Beale Street Could Talk might be just about the most perfect novel ever. I don’t think he puts a foot wrong once.I know I am about 50 years late to the party but good lord is One Hundred Years of Solitude good. Underline half the pages, stay in bath until toes have shrivelled up, surviving on minimal hours sleep today good. The scene with Arcadio’s execution was astounding.Meanwhile, lonelybloomer has just finished Don DeLillo’s White Noise:It would be great to casually find more books like that. The humorous detail every now and then, existential musings, an apocalypse flavour and University setting on top of it - turns out, it’s my jam! I didn’t expect it to be so fun and accessible, too, because once earlier I’ve picked up his another book on JFK murder (the title escapes me) and couldn’t finish because I barely knew what was going on in it.Oh well, you can’t win them all, all the time. (That JFK book is called Libra.)RobertHowardNG9 has been rereading Birthday by Alan Sillitoe and “loving it as much as the first time”:Like Stoner by John Williams it is one those rare books I actually feel a participant in, rather than observer. Chapter 8 with Arthur Seaton in conversation with his wife Avril makes me wonder how Sillitoe overheard me and my wife?“Spurred by the sad death of Albert Finney”, beckythatcher has also been reading Sillitoe – this time Saturday Night and Sunday Morning:It’s a forgotten masterpiece. The characters all ring true. The description of factory work and pub nights is as good as (better than) a documentary. The post-war boom in earnings and full employment gave working people plenty of spare cash, and the family scenes are marvellous. Adultery, abortion, street fights and nosy neighbours - it’s all there. There’s a little, regrettable, sub-DH Lawrence stuff about countryside, but that’s more than forgivable.BristolHatter has been enjoying The Dawn Watch by Maya Jasonoff:I have read a number of books about Joseph Conrad over the years but this is shaping up to be one of the best so far. It is basically a biography with a concentration on the relevance of four of his novels to the experience of modern day life. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in Conrad and his work.LLCoolJ_ recommends Late In The Day by Tessa Hadley:It’s the third of hers I’ve read, and she has yet to disappoint. I’ll take these words from NYT review:Hadley is adept at fluid omniscience, at storytelling that skims through the years as easily as it weaves through various points of view......and add that she is also adept at developing fully-realized characters, male and female, young and middle-aged. I almost forgot that I was reading about fictional characters. I liked it very muchFinally, SydneyH declares that Men at Arms, the first of Evelyn Waugh’s Sword of Honour series, “is a charming book”:Guy Crouchback, a middle-class, orced misfit, signs up with the Halberdiers regiment in the second world war. To the admiration of his peers, he grows a thick moustache, curls it with a hot iron, and procures a monocle for shooting. Waugh introduces a few brilliant characters, notably Crouchback’s fellow soldier, Apthorpe, but also his Cyclopean Brigadier Ritchie-Hook, and his man-hopping ex-wife. Much of the humour comes from the fiasco of administrating a rapidly-changing war campaign, with eccentric officers – some of whom are promoted just to be gotten rid of – complicating matters.Those who have read Sword Of Honour will also know about the “thunderbox”, and its responsibility for what must be one of the greatest moments in literary history… But to say more would ruin a wonderful surprise. Suffice to say, Evelyn Waugh was a genius.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

He blamed Brexit for the car giant’s decision. He said he had voted remain in the EU referendum and condemned the local Conservative MP Justin Tomlinson for campaigning for Brexit.“He wanted Brexit – he gets to carry the can. If he’s not unseated by a massive majority at the next election then this town gets what it deserves,” he said.He said he thought the government was “completely incompetent” and felt “pretty hacked off” by the news.Another man asked how he felt as he left the site replied: “Devastated. That’s all I can say.”Union leaders echoed that view, with Unite’s Des Quinn saying closure would represent “a shattering body blow at the heart of UK manufacturing”.The news comes as a particular shock in a community that has been relatively well insulated from the difficulties that have accompanied Brexit. Swindon, which has high employment and low immigration, is not typically seen as being at the sharp end of the referendum result. The city is ranked seventh in the country for productivity and has the second lowest percentage of residents in the country with no formal qualifications, according to the council.But some more deprived areas of the town have seen few of the benefits that have accrued to the better-off areas.Another worker said Honda – which builds 160,000 Civic cars a year at the plant – was integral to Swindon. “For the people and their families, it’s big, big news and this will have a huge effect,” he said.He said that so far all he had heard were rumours. “We’ve not found out anything yet – I’ve not even had chance to read the report,” he said. “I’ve got a mortgage to pay off. I don’t know anything about it other than what people were saying on my lunch break.”He also felt Brexit was to blame. “People voted for something without thinking of the consequences – it is what it is,” he said.While other workers also said they had not heard any official statements from management, one said she could neither deny nor confirm a meeting had been called for 8am on Tuesday.Alan Tomala, regional officer for the Unite union who worked at the plant between 1995 and 2007, said workers were “angry, dismayed and worried”.“If the speculation is to be confirmed, 3,500 jobs are at risk,” Tomala said. “The usual formula is one job in the plant equates to four in the supply chain and the local economy. If closure is confirmed, it will rip the heart out of this area.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24d9945b6755488e0ca05dc1e50dd9aba347b992/0_43_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d05470e3d717ce91e6462d458bdf3e1","title":"most shoppers say brexit has not affected spending habits","story":"People in pro-leave areas of Britain have tended not to curb expenditure, finds PwC surveyBritish consumers are preparing to carry on shopping despite the mounting political chaos over Brexit, according to a survey, even as business leaders increasingly sound the alarm over the potential hit to the economy.More than half of consumers in the nationwide survey told the accountancy firm PwC they had not, and would not, alter their spending habits over the course of this year as a consequence of Brexit.According to the study of more than 2,000 shoppers carried out in December, parts of Britain with higher proportions of leave voters were more likely to say they would not change their plans.Kien Tan, the retail strategy director of PwC, said that Brexit fears were likelier to have an impact on spending in wealthier areas as poorer consumers had less spending to curb in the first place.“The reality is that all this stuff is going on politically but, in terms of people’s day-to-day lives, it really only affects certain groups of people,” he added.The analysis comes after official figures suggested that consumers shrugged off fears over Brexit to raise their spending in January. It also comes as households start to see real incomes rise, as inflation fades and annual wage growth accelerates.While consumers might appear to be tuning out of the political chaos over Brexit, UK companies have reacted with greater concern.Britain’s biggest manufacturers will warn the government on Tuesday that failure to secure a deal with Brussels would be catastrophic, with a warning that reverting to World Trade Organization rules would “kill off some sectors of industry overnight”.Make UK, the manufacturing lobby group previously known as the EEF, will raise the alarm at its annual conference and dinner before Philip Hammond, the chancellor, addresses industry leaders.However, despite most multinational firms having Brexit contingency plans in place, smaller outfits are believed to be lagging behind. The Bank of England has previously warned that most UK businesses are unprepared for a no-deal Brexit.In response to the potential risks, Barclays announced on Tuesday that it is preparing to host more than 100 “Brexit clinics” in March, in an attempt to give extra support to businesses across the country.The bank’s business relationship managers will lead sessions on managing cash flow, exporting goods abroad, supply chain management, labour and fraud prevention.Barclays’ CEO, Jes Staley, said: “Barclays is fully prepared for any Brexit scenario and we stand ready to help our clients through this period too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

The backbench group has pressured prime minister Theresa May towards trading with the EU on World Trade Organization terms after 29 March, rather than having a withdrawal period.Back on Honda, the political fallout from the closure of the Swindon plant is only just beginning.Pro-EU politicians have disregarded Honda’s assertion that Brexit is not the main reason for its decision.David Lammy, the Labour MP, said the decision was “gut-wrenching”. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said it was “ridiculous” to claim it was not Brexit-related.Higher costs and stock market falls chipped away at its trading businesses, while it also warned that an economic slowdown in China and the UK would throw up further hurdles this year.Chief executive John Flint, rounding off his first year at the helm of the company, said the bank may have to scale back investment plans in order to avoid missing a key target to grow revenues faster than costs for a second straight year.Honda said it will focus its future manufacturing activity in regions where it expects high production volumes, in a statement published this morning.Katsushi Inoue, Honda’s chief officer for European regional operations, said:In light of the unprecedented changes that are affecting our industry, it is vital that we accelerate our electrification strategy and restructure our global operations accordingly.As a result, we have had to take this difficult decision to consult our workforce on how we might prepare our manufacturing network for the future. This has not been taken lightly and we deeply regret how unsettling today’s announcement will be for our people.Swindon, which was unveiled as the global production hub for the Civic only in 2017, makes 150,000 cars every year – one every 69 seconds.Yet its “current role as a global manufacturing hub may no longer be viable”, Honda said.Carmakers generally have a five- to seven-year investment cycle for production of each model, but Howells said the decision on what to do in Swindon had “collided with this change to electrification”.Staff will now have a consultation over their future. The company will offer a “whole raft of support services” to employees who lose their jobs, Howells said. He added:Clearly it’s a very sad day for us.Honda insists the decision to close the Swindon plant is not related to Brexit, but rather the need to target its largest markets as the car industry rapidly moves towards electrification.Ian Howells, the senior vice president at Honda Motor Europe, said the industry is facing “unprecedented change in the industry” on a “global scale”, in an interview on BBC radio.This is not a Brexit-related issue for us. This decision has been made on the basis of the global issues.“We’re having to look very closely at where we’re putting investment,” he said. Honda’s main markets are in the US, China and Japan.Greg Clark, the government’s business secretary, said Honda’s decision was a “commercial decision based on unprecedented changes in the global market”.It is “a devastating decision for Swindon and the UK”, he said. This news is a particularly bitter blow to the thousands of skilled and dedicated staff who work at the factory, their families and all of those employed in the supply chain. I will convene a taskforce in Swindon with local MPs, civic and business leaders as well as trade union representatives to ensure that the skills and expertise of the workforce is retained, and these highly valued employees move into new skilled employment.The decision is also a blow coming after recent government investments in battery technology – although Honda has not been a direct recipient of state aid, unlike Nissan and other carmakers. Clark said:The automotive industry is undergoing a rapid transition to new technology. The UK is one of the leaders in the development of these technologies and so it is deeply disappointing that this decision has been taken now.Japanese carmaker Honda will end production in Swindon in 2021. The factory employs 3,500 people.Even amid the political turmoil, European stock markets are expected to open flat this morning. points out North Swindon Conservative MP Justin Tomlinson’s comments that Brexit is not to blame for the closure, after he spoke to Honda and essentially confirmed the plans yesterday.Tomlinson made it clear he believed the decision was driven by “global trends and not Brexit” and a retrenchment of the carmaker in its Japanese home market. Tomlinson campaigned in favour of leaving the EU.The news of Honda’s likely announcement dominated the business pages this morning – even if the defection of seven Labour MPs to a new independent group drove the day on the front pages.The Financial Times used the Honda story to highlight just how close we are to the planned date of Brexit on 29 March, and how a fresh trade deal between the EU and Japan may have tipped the balance away from the UK.’s front page story on Honda highlights the effect on jobs, with 3,500 Honda employees who could lose their roles. Unions described it as a “shattering body blow”.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.The struggles of the British car industry in the past two years have been well documented, and today we are expecting confirmation of the latest blow: the exit of Honda manufacturing from the UK.An announcement on the future of Honda’s Swindon plant is expected this morning after the company has informed its employees. If confirmed, it would put about 3,500 jobs at risk – as well as symbolising the decline of one of British manufacturing’s success stories.The car industry across the world is struggling with a slowdown in the Chinese economy as well as a political and regulatory backlash against pollution from diesel vehicles in Europe. However, Brexit fears – which have been blamed for stalling investment – have also stalked the industry.Honda, alongside other Japanese manufacturers Nissan and Toyota, was attracted to the UK in the 1980s by the Thatcher government with the promise of easy access to European markets. The departure of Honda so soon after Nissan u-turned on a decision to build its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland presents another blow to the current government.After a quieter start to the week on the economics front, this morning sees the latest update on the British jobs market, with unemployment and wage growth figures due from the Office for National Statistics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e6d2ca86f1a7df7ea4622cc1b3706183a2d174/0_1676_3276_1966/master/3276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c2ea122e04cb670e60f97e7bf41b006","title":"city of stairs the interconnecting walkways of hong kong","story":"Hans Leo Maes captures the bridges and stairways that link up the hilly, population-dense cityHong Kong is known for its flashing lights, neon signs and high-rise skylines.

It may yet break apart the moribund political system. But that seismic rupture didn’t happen today when seven MPs walked out of the Labour party.Seven is a pitifully small number. The timing is monstrously badly judged and the reasons the MPs give are oddly scattergun, lacking political punch and focus. To be sure, they are not alone in thinking Jeremy Corbyn a weak leader with many failings: his poll ratings show most of the country agrees, as did the 172 Labour MPs who voted no confidence in him two and half years ago, as his “kinder gentler politics” turned poisonous.But whether born of despair or vanity, this walkout is a damaging distraction, because right here, right now, there is only one cause that matters – Brexit. That’s not one issue among many, it is the great question that has the nation’s future hanging by a thread. It is the debate that contains within it all the other arguments about Britain’s ideals, identities, ideologies and insanities.Those other MPs who tried to oust Corbyn still think much the same of him now as they did then. But they have not quit, not at this catastrophically inappropriate juncture, erting attention from the supreme task of this generation of politicians. The best of them, such as Peter Kyle and Yvette Cooper, are stuck deep into battle to rescue us from calamity: Labour will again back Cooper’s amendment next week to prevent a no-deal crash-out and delay withdrawal. Some of those 35 Labour MPs who failed to back it last time are being brought round, giving it a good chance of success.It does of course madden many Labour MPs that foot-dragging Corbyn has been almost absent from the fight against this Tory Brexit disaster. With him surrounded, if not held captive, by a cabal of Len McCluskey’s people, you only had to listen to the Unite leader’s infuriating pro-Brexit views on the Peston show last week to suspect he spoke the Labour leader’s mind too. Their views are deep-frozen in the 1970s. But what matters is less what Corbyn privately thinks than what he does when it comes to crunch Brexit votes – and so far, there has been no misstep.Labour MPs walking away at this point only give succour to those Labour pro-Brexiters,such as Caroline Flint, who caricature those in favour of reversing Brexit as members of “metropolitan elites”. Paradoxically, their defection hardened the resolve of scores of Labour MPs to stay, those who in the past considered splitting. They are the ones most angry at the defectors, accusing them of failing to work hard enough in their constituencies, failing to build around themselves loyal teams to fight off marauders. The one who has their sympathy is Luciana Berger, bombarded with antisemitic abuse and forced to fight off deselection when about to give birth.This walkout comes as a head of steam is building up within Labour at Corbyn appearing to dodge his party’s conference policy to back a referendum. Corbyn’s own Momentum movement has been expressing its frustration at their leader’s reluctance to get behind a people’s vote. Labour has been haemorrhaging members, old and new, over Brexit. Wherever I go, Labour people tell me they are struggling to persuade members not to tear up their cards. “Don’t do it!” they say. “Stay and fight for Labour to take the right stand on Brexit. Corbyn won’t be there much longer: stay to select the next leader, don’t abandon us.”Does this feel at all like 1981 and the creation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which broke away from Michael Foot’s Labour? Not a jot. I was there and there is no comparison. These seven lack anyone of the stature, public recognition or intellectual heft of the SDP leaders. The Gang of Four between them had all held serious government office – between them they had occupied the roles of chancellor, home secretary, foreign secretary, education and transport secretary. This grouplet does not have that kind of weight and it lacks ideological substance and ideas. Corbyn’s failure to stamp out antisemitism is a just cause, but why not stay to fight it? Remember, the SDP defectors left not out of irritation with an inadequate leader, but because they could not and would not stand on Foot’s manifesto that pledged to leave the EU and Nato.Compare that to Corbyn and John McDonnell’s last manifesto, which was widely popular, with no ideological deal-breakers for a broad church party. Some might query costings or priorities – why billions for middle-class students, not for needy toddlers in Sure Starts? Some might niggle at the practicalities of utility renationalisation – but these were popular policies. Nothing there felt like an updated version of the notorious 1981 manifesto, dubbed the “longest suicide note in history”. These seven defectors were vague on reasons for jumping ship, beyond wishing for a better leader.Philip Collins , a former speechwriter for Tony Blair, has written a good manifesto for a putative new social democratic party, entitled Start Again. But since almost any Labour MP would back almost all of it, that suggests less need for a new party than for one better led. Brexit could still destroy Labour. The 2017 manifesto got away with promising “the benefits of the single market and the customs union”. Since then, Keir Starmer has deftly led the party to vote the right way on every Brexit ision. So far so good.But now Corbyn needs to back the Peter KylePhil Wilson clever compromise. Their plan is for MPs to agree to pass Theresa May’s bad deal, but only on condition it is put to the voters for a final decision. People on both sides of the ide are gathering round this option as the best chance of resolving Brexit, once and for all, whenever May finally holds her meaningful vote. The plan lets MPs in Brexit-voting seats obey their electorate by voting for May’s Brexit – but frees them to campaign to remain in a referendum. The good signs are that McDonnell and Starmer are warming to the plan. This will be Corbyn’s vital test: in the end he will have no choice but to do the right thing.If the Labour leader ends up in any way enabling Brexit if as a modern-day Ramsay MacDonald he makes Labour complicit in this historic Tory catastrophe, then expect all hell to break loose in the party. If he goes against the will of his party, the great majority of his voters and his MPs, the party will break apart – and so it should. But that hasn’t happened. These seven are jumping a gun that may never be fired. They will find it cold out there. I know that from experience. So deep was the SDPLabour split that sitting in the  canteen, Labourites picked up their plates and walked away from us SDP-ites. Schism is bitter and personal. And in this particular case, needless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48464a3c9771fe306e5ac4f911d1156c3e1057b9/0_340_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16fe19227ada3197a9e48a2400ebefe6","title":"bees bavaria planet germans","story":"In a recent campaign Germans of all outlooks stood up against corporate greed and political apathy – and wonLast week, Bavarians forced their state legislature to change farming policies with the most successful petition in the state’s history. And while the law proposed by the petition covers a range of measures, it’s no surprise that campaigners’ rallying cry quickly became “save the bees”. Bees stand for diligence, dedication and orderliness. But they are also a symbol of our relationship with nature – and everything that has been wrong with it for decades. Bees are emblematic of how the fight to save our planet and stop runaway climate change cannot wait. They are our canary in the coalmine.Bees are essential for our food supply: apples, courgettes, almonds – one in every three bites we eat depends on bees and other pollinators. But soil sealing and industrial, monocultural agriculture using bee-harming pesticides have caused a massive decline in bee populations worldwide, to the extent that apple farmers in China have to pollinate their trees by hand.Instead of being good beekeepers, taking care of nature so it takes care of us, we have neglected it, endangering our own long-term survival. Corporations that are more focused on maximising profits than their responsibility towards people and the planet have a pivotal role to play in saving the bees – and, ultimately, the planet. Ironically, it is a German company, Bayer, that since the acquisition of Monsanto has become the epitome of this exact type of toxic agro-industry, promoting monocultures and selling pesticides that harm bees and destroy bioersity. And while the consequences of this might not yet show on our plates, they can be seen in changed landscapes – literal and political.The organisations and voters carrying the successful campaign in Bavaria weren’t just a loud minority of environmentalists. They were a broad and erse coalition, of progressives and conservatives, who want to preserve our precious ecosystems in the face of damaging industrial farming practices. It is this same combination of progressives and conservative conservationists that got Winfried Kretschmann elected as Germany’s first Green party governor in Bavaria’s neighbouring state Baden-Württemberg. Kretschmann’s philosophy that environmental politics are key to preserving creation is key to understanding the foundation of the historical win for the bees in Christian-conservative Bavaria.The campaign’s messaging also helped to bring people of different political views together. For example, instead of putting all the blame for loss of bioersity on farmers, the campaign explicitly highlighted the struggles of small farms as one of the issues to address. Maybe out of reflex, many farmers still felt scapegoated, but this inclusive approach nevertheless helped to build bridges. During a time in which heated and highly isive debates about rightwing populism and diesel car bans in cities dominate the public discourse in Germany, finding common ground was critical.Bavaria’s remarkable campaign to save the bees can give us all cause for optimism. Where politicians failed to protect the environment and put corporate profits first, Bavarians stood up and have taken power back in their hands. Empowering people to fight for our planet is at the heart of what the organisation I work for does, it is why SumOfUs supported the campaign in Bavaria. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of SumOfUs members are calling on the EU to take immediate steps to improve the way it tests all pesticides, to ensure bees are protected.Climate change, our changing landscapes and the global loss of bioersity are increasingly visible. Faced with this, people of all political backgrounds are rising up, like in Bavaria. Many of these people wouldn’t have considered themselves activists before – and maybe still don’t. But they see the necessity for change and are willing to take a stand for it – some of them even wearing a bee costume.• Christian Bock is a Berlin-based campaigner for SumOfUs, an organisation using people power to hold the biggest companies in the world to account."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4261abcfca6318c32bfca9124d57203fa6551a92/0_22_5414_3248/master/5414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41bc1aa57179692ea8775fa59adec431","title":"i cant wait for the striking schoolchildren to grab the reins of power","story":"The UK’s kids protesting climate change were passionate, articulate and unafraid – those with old ideas need to get out of the wayThis is a country for old men. So is the United States. Donald Trump is 72, and people are talking about Joe Biden running against him, aged 76 another possible presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, is 77. In the UK, Jeremy Corbyn is 69 John McDonnell is 67 Vince Cable is 75. Jacob Rees-Mogg is 89. Only one of these ages is a lie. I guess you can work it out. Whatever happened to retiring? Why are these men considered to be at their political peak? I speak as a nan myself. Will I be running for office in 15 years’ time?The blokes who govern the “free” world were brought into sharp relief by last week’s strike against climate change. My God, it was something. Suddenly in my house and on TV screens there were angry, informed teenage girls – and yes, it was mostly girls – talking about how we have just 12 years to do something. They were passionate, articulate and unafraid. Their energy was contagious. The fact they were having a fabulous time at a protest was inspiring and all the daft criticism about bunking off came from the zombie class such as Andrea Leadsom and various dullard rentagobs who don’t even seem to understand what school is: an hour a day of learning followed by hours of crowd control. But then I guess bunking off is as outre as running through fields of wheat for these alien suck-ups.I am not pretending to be down with the kids – that is an entirely pointless exercise – but I do wonder about the way generational differences are playing out at the moment. The denunciation of the protests by the right wing is also a refusal to take climate change seriously. It is an entirely blinkered view. This “I’m all right, Jack” attitude is fine, I suppose, if you don’t have children or grandchildren who you would like to be able to breathe, and not be subject to the breakdown of society that climate change inevitably brings. What links those currently attacking the kids is not age but a certain political word view. Being rightwing makes you disturbingly ancient, somehow. Yes, I know the cliches about young folk being liberal until they are 30, when their heads take over from their hearts or the US political writer Irving Kristol saying that a conservative “is a liberal mugged by reality”. The idea is that, as we get older, we become more conservative.What actually seems to make people more conservative, from my observation, is becoming parents what makes them fearful of change and social liberalism is the lack of money and choice, which brings a clinging to familiar structures. None of this is properly addressed by just shouting at old people to die soon, which is one of the tactics of some remainers. The vying up of the generations ultimately amounts to some seemingly advocating a cull as the solution to Brexit: old, illiberal people voted for it and they will die out. But none of this speaks to the interdependence of generations, the fact that we live in an era in which adult children share parental homes, in which job opportunities have diminished in many areas of the country and further education has been decimated. Bringing the country together means just that. When youth bursts through, of course we cheer: whether its Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the US, or our own stroppy girls in the UK.I cannot wait for these people to grab the reins of power. I neither want the closed and aged mindsets of the Tories banging on about wars they didn’t fight, nor the inflexibility of old Labour men obsessed with revolutions that produced dictators. Ageing is a fact, but open minds stay youthful. Those with old ideas need to get out of the way.

But with a snap election just weeks away, it now risks a crash as spectacular as its rise. Has the leftwing populist model of ponytailed rebel Pablo Iglesias and his gang of talented young thinkers, so admired by many Jeremy Corbyn backers and others around Europe, proved a failure?Polling suggests the party is in deep trouble. Podemos once led the polls and very nearly snatched leadership of Spain’s left from prime minister Pedro Sánchez’s Socialist party at the 2016 elections, but it is now only the voters’ fourth favourite party. The meltdown means it is slated to lose half its deputies, while Sánchez gallops ahead, taking well over twice as many votes as Podemos on 28 April.The far-right populist party Vox is now also snapping at its heels, adding ideological insult to electoral injury. In April, Vox will target the same working-class city neighbourhoods as Podemos – claiming that immigrants and Catalan separatists, not austerity, are the problem. Mainstream parties will undoubtedly argue that this is merely one populism replacing another. That misses the point.Although Spain has changed since Podemos picked up the banner of the indignado protesters and charged dramatically on to the scene in the 2014 European elections, the damage is largely self-inflicted. In the latest of a series of internal bust-ups, Iglesias’s former No 2, Iñigo Errejón, is leading an alternative coalition into elections for the powerful Madrid regional government in May.The split matters partly because Errejón was, after Iglesias, the most visible and charismatic of the talented young leaders who created Podemos. Such was the passion they provoked that the two politicians could do stadium tours, filling seats with excited supporters chanting “Yes we can!” Those queuing to see them afterwards were just as keen to plant a kiss on the boyish-looking Errejón as they were to grab a selfie with Iglesias.More importantly, Errejón was also a key theorist in a party that pledged to break moulds and shed the shackles that had kept the reforming left out of power. He was the most forthright proponent of a philosophy of popular “transversal” coalitions that knitted together a wide variety of groups opposed to the status quo in one of Europe’s most corrupt and unequal societies. This allowed Podemos to channel the rage of the spontaneous indignado protests, which had occupied city squares in 2011. It also prevented it repeating the doomed coalitions routinely put together under the dead hand of Spain’s communist party. Everybody was welcome, the message became, under Podemos’s bright, purple-coloured umbrella.That message is no longer so clear. Indeed, the party appears to have forgotten that its success has always depended on the fact that it is part of a much broader movement of leftwing regeneration.Both mayors have performed remarkably well as they seek to make cities more liveable, rather than merely richer. Carmena has even pulled off the apparently impossible trick of reducing the debt inherited from big-spending rightwing mayors without instituting austerity. Charges that the new left is radical, dangerous and irresponsible now ring hollow.Neither mayor allows herself to be bossed by Podemos, a party that is only half-joking when it repeatedly references the power battles waged in Game of Thrones. Colau remains on friendly terms, but the relationship with Carmena has soured as Podemos has shed allies.Errejón has joined Carmena and her alternative umbrella group, Más Madrid. This will compete with Podemos (and the communists who are now its most important coalition allies) for votes in the regional elections in May. To confuse things further, Errejón still claims to be a loyal Podemos member.Monica Oltra, the deputy premier of Valencia’s regional government, has already said that her Compromís party, a key local ally, will not repeat an electoral coalition with Podemos in the April general election. En Marea, a similar ally in Galicia, has also walked away. As a result, Podemos’s broad coalition looks increasingly skinny and self-centred.Podemos should also ask itself why the three most powerful women on Spain’s new left – the two mayors and Oltra – all operate outside the party. Even within Podemos, and despite gender-balanced quota systems, women complain that the party suffers from an overload of testosterone.The only really visible woman in Podemos is now Irene Montero, the party’s spokeswoman in parliament. She and Iglesias are a couple. A recent decision to raise their children in a generously-sized country house with a swimming pool has helped take the shine off a party that claims to represent ordinary Spaniards. Podemos members, when consulted, voted to keep them in their positions. Ordinary voters, unused to such luxury, will not be so understanding.The Podemos story remains remarkable and the party has a history of proving naysayers wrong. A year after its foundation, it packed Madrid’s Puerta del Sol square with supporters as Iglesias told the crowd to challenge the monsters of “financial totalitarianism” and “take their dreams seriously”.That was four years ago, when the damage caused by the global financial crash and a burst construction bubble at home was rawer than it is now. In December, a Podemos-led coalition lost a third of its votes in regional elections in southern Andalucia. Instead of asking Podemos to take over the traditionally leftwing regional government, voters in one of Spain’s poorest regions ushered in a rightwing government backed by Vox. When that happens, something has gone badly wrong with the “Podemos revolution”.• Giles Tremlett is a journalist and author based in Madrid"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3ec103ed334a95d4172b6b2a2e4c1b35431a922/0_15_512_307/master/512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70f2151e159d41a795ddb213b2b7cfee","title":"10 tech trends and innovations for 2019","story":"From opinionated robots to the frictionless flow of data between departments, here are the key tech movements that are likely to transform the way we work1 Automation and artificial intelligence (Al)A new level of self-training is allowing robots to draw their own conclusions and make deductions that haven’t been hard-coded into them, so that when looking at large volumes of data, they can point things out that humans would probably have missed, leading to brand-new thinking.“Take CCTV and real-time video, which produces a volume of footage that can be impenetrable to humans,” says Ron Brown, DXC Technology’s chief technologist for the public sector in the UK. “AI can begin to make sense of it by looking for specific things that we know we want to watch for, but also by discovering things that we hadn’t even thought of.”The key to changing this is the human interface, with people using mobile devices to access systems through technology such as speech and face recognition. In essence, your identity is contained within your mobile device.3 Internet of things (IoT)We are now moving into the second generation of IoT, with sensors that can enable devices to make their own autonomous decisions and carry out processes that go beyond simple data gathering.It’s a technology that is already maturing in the domestic market, with applications such as webcams and remote lighting controls. With reliable networks and improved security, there will also be huge potential civic uses, too.4 Smart citiesSmart cities deploy communication and information technologies to improve services and the way the city is run, such as supporting public transport that can respond to varying demands and lighting systems that can be optimised to reduce energy bills.Mesh networks are set to take smart cities to the next level. They involve a collection of access points that talk to each other, making them more reliable, cheaper and able to take advantage of 5G, with download speeds and bandwidths hundreds of times greater than current ones.“These good connections, which are stable and can take massive data volumes, change the game completely,” says Brown. “All of a sudden, autonomous vehicles and drones become a reality.”5 The digital enterpriseThe idea of a digital enterprise is one where information has been digitised and technical barriers removed, allowing what Brown calls “the frictionless flow of data between departments”.This “machine-to-machine” interface not only speeds things up, but also encourages the sharing of ideas, greater cooperation and the destruction of workplace silos.6 BlockchainBlockchain technology provides a shared digital record of a transaction, securely logging where something has come from and where it’s going. Within a digital enterprise, it can be applied to back-end systems, reducing the threat of cyber risk as departments interact with each other.It can also provide a secure and verifiable audit trail of transactions between a department and citizens, without the need for paper or digging into databases.7 Cyber risk“The cyber risk landscape has changed,” says Brown. “In the old days, we used firewalls to put a fortress around a business or a department, but that no longer works if you’re going to have good collaboration, with departments and teams freely sharing information.”What’s required now, he explains, is the migration to a new way of thinking and the acceptance that not everything needs the same level of defence. So, instead of the fortress approach, “what you effectively have to do is put a defence around inidual data stores and devices”.8 Flexible workforceBrown advocates a “mobile first” policy that recognises that people do so much with their devices at home, yet, “when they get to work, the technology is 10 years out of date and they’re forced to use a paving slab of a laptop”.Instead, he believes, they should be able to choose to use their own device, something they’re familiar with and can help them be more productive. Some organisations are doing this, but many are yet to take this step.When he uses his own device for work, an app kicks in and splits his personal stuff from his work, he explains. “It ensures I conform to security policies and allows the company to wipe the business side of my device if they feel I’ve been compromised, but without touching my personal stuff.”This, he says, is not complex or expensive. The technology has been around for quite some time. “What’s slowed down its adoption is culture change.”9 Digital talentReplatforming and digitising more processes and data can dramatically change the skill set a department requires, with a significant shift in demand for people skilled in information integration, analytics and information governance.These digital skills are scarce and demand is high, so the public sector will need to start to think outside the box, looking to new ideas such as “bring your own team” and even posts on crowdsourcing sites, to find the talent they need.10 The rise of intelligent decision-making“It’s time to stop guessing and start measuring,” says Brown. “By harnessing dispersed data from across business processes, you can start to power data-driven decision-making.”By joining up these disparate pockets of data, organisations can get a much better overall view of performance, helping them to improve productivity and meet their own KPIs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb28c3201ef9d2826f0ac56b03be89507b484d2f/0_694_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6777d546a4b0735de588a51daf3450a","title":"child bedsit more character than braying public schoolboy mr hinds education secretary","story":"The education secretary should come up with policies to help children – and fund them – instead of making platitudes about yogaYears ago I taught a young girl who had been diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. At the age of 15, she knew that in her adult life she would be a wheelchair user. Yet, she continued working towards her dream of becoming a scriptwriter, a dream tough enough to achieve when growing up in one of the poorest parts of the country, even harder when faced with such physical limitations. Joyfully, that student, Matilda Ibini, has gone from strength to strength and I now follow on social media her career as an award-winning playwright.Contrast such grit and determination with the latest vision of “character” to come from the education secretary, Damian Hinds.In a speech to church school leaders, Hinds said children’s “character and resilience” are vitally important. Such platitudes are dull from a politician who should be tackling much bigger issues, such as school underfunding and the teacher shortage, but they are not a crime. Everyone knows character is important, so it’s fair to emphasise it.Unfortunately, Hinds didn’t stop there. In classic Conservative fashion, he equated “character” with “public school confidence”.I don’t know what he thinks the phrase means, not least because Hinds didn’t even attend an independent school, but for much of the population it conjures up a swaggering sense of entitlement that can sweep aside other people. Is that really want he wants to instil?Hinds went on to list the five foundations that he has decided will bestow this braying character on children across the land and – quelle surprise – they look exactly like the sort of thing you’d see in a prospectus for Eton.Sport is on the list, obviously, along with so-called purposeful activities such as “rock climbing, hiking, orienteering, gym programmes, yoga … ”. Next up are “creative” activities (such as art) and “performing” (sing in a choir), plus volunteering and work experience as the fourth and fifth foundations.Look closely at that list. Breathe in its middle-class suppositions. And then answer these questions. How is yoga more purposeful than, say, playing computer games? Isn’t creating YouTube videos a form of art? And is being responsible for picking up five siblings from school and getting their dinner ready, as some children do, a form of volunteering that would build character, or does it only count if you’re wearing a Scout uniform?Umpteen factors can help children to develop character and resilience, which makes the list redundant. Furthermore, children today often develop their resilience in circumstances Hinds ought to be trying to change. Right now, for example, across the country there are more than 100,000 children living in temporary accommodation. That’s three times more than in 2010 and directly related to the punitive welfare system brought in by Hinds’ Conservative party.The level of uncertainty those children have to cope with, the sheer difficulty of staying organised enough to keep up with schoolwork while moving from place to place, mean most young people in this position develop more resilience in their little finger than some rugby-playing, yoga-taking politicians have in their entire anatomy.Will this level of grit be recognised in Hinds’s plan to benchmark schools against his new public-school-character-activities ticklist? Of course not. Nor will schools be given any money to implement his brainwave. At best, if a headteacher manages to battle through slashed budgets and imploding welfare services, yet still deliver the Duke of Edinburgh award, they might be in with a shot of getting one of the Department for Education’s Character Awards.Trophies are always nice, of course, but real policies and funding would be so much better.

The influential body, founded by headteachers, has been working for two years to come up with a common set of values to help school leaders navigate what they describe as an education “moral maze”, in which behaviour can be driven by a preoccupation with results.But why do we need to recalibrate school leadership to be more ethical? In many ways this is a troubling question to be asking on a damp February morning in the successful south London comprehensive Roberts has led for the past six years.Does the fact that we need to reinvigorate the moral purpose of education suggest that something has gone wrong with school leadership? Is it now unethical?Roberts, headteacher of Thomas Tallis school, a huge erse comprehensive sandwiched between Blackheath and Kidbrooke in the London borough of Greenwich, chooses her words carefully. “We now have so many different types of schools and we need to be certain there is enough that binds us together.”While Roberts is careful not to criticise fellow heads, the elephants in the room are hard to ignore: regular reports about some schools “off-rolling” – getting rid of challenging students cheating in exams “gaming” the curriculum by channelling students into easier subjects. And then there’s exorbitant headteacher pay, and even financial scams that verge on the criminal.Roberts knows headteachers are under intense pressure to keep improving results. She admits that in the past – she was head of two schools in the north-east before moving to London – she has faced “personal dilemmas” over issues such as the use of GCSE-equivalent qualifications that were promoted intensively to boost some schools’ league table positions.“It is really hard for people who are under pressure all the time,” she says. “Too many headteachers have found themselves compromised. The accountability measures say they have to achieve one thing and the local authority or academy trust says you have to do it quickly, therefore decision-making becomes harder and people take what they may view as shortcuts.“It is perfectly reasonable to make sure that a child gets a good set of examination results. But we can’t get away from the fact that schools are communities that ought to model what we value about society. What we are hearing is that headteachers want a language they can use to support them in that long-term nuanced work.”In an age where “robust” leadership and easily measured outcomes are highly valued, the commission could be accused of promoting a more “wishy-washy” definition of education.Michael Gove, the former education secretary, whose reforms still shape the lives of many schools, pioneered the idea of a slimmed-down inspection framework devoid of what he described as “peripherals” such as pupil wellbeing and community cohesion. His colleague Nick Gibb, who once described the idea of social and emotional learning as “ghastly”, remains as schools minister.But the Ethical Leadership Commission has high-level support from the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which helped to set it up, the National Association of Head Teachers, the Church of England Education Office, the Headmasters and Headmistresses’ Conference, the Chartered College of Teaching and the National Governors’ Association. At the publication of its final report last month, it received a warm welcome from the interim National Schools Commissioner, Dominic Herrington.Geoff Barton, general secretary of ASCL and a former headteacher, is adamant that the current system is not unethical. “The vast majority of practice upholds the values articulated in this framework,” he says. “Our members felt it was time to identify and articulate the principles and values that are immutable in education leadership, and provide a supportive framework upon which school leaders can draw in making difficult decisions under great pressure.”A hundred schools are now trialling the framework and an ethics forum will meet several times a year to consider the sort of dilemmas leaders face, in the context of the Nolan principles – seven principles of public life: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership – to which the commission has added the personal characteristics of trust, wisdom, kindness, justice, service, courage and optimism.The chief inspector of schools, Amanda Spielman, is a member of the commission and Roberts believes proposed changes to the Ofsted framework – away from focusing on results and towards a broader definition of “quality of education” – reinforce the idea that change is coming.Far from being abstract, she argues, the commission’s “virtues and values” are intricately bound up in real-life dilemmas faced by heads, and marshalling them into a framework can give colleagues confidence and courage. “For example, it is about going down the road and looking a colleague in the eye and saying: ‘the way you do admissions or exclusions affects my school, and can we talk about this?’ That is quite a difficult thing to do, so courage is very important.“It is about heads feeling they can be honest with parents if there is a disappointing set of GCSE results. It is about ensuring that children see adults treating each other in a just, wise and kind way, modelling the sort of behaviour we would want to see in society,” says Roberts.She adds: “It is about supporting heads who want to take time to see both sides of the argument before making a reasoned judgment, or those who would prefer to support and be kind to a teacher who is under pressure in the hope of helping them through a difficult patch, rather than feeling that they are compromised because people expect them to be instant judges and zero-tolerant of failure.”Even the current debate about mobile phone use in school has an ethical dimension, she says, and should be seen in the broader context of how society and adults use electronic devices.Most urgently, though, she argues that the framework is needed because England is facing a chronic teacher recruitment and retention crisis and headteachers in their 50s are leaving the profession in record numbers, partly because of competitive pressures and leadership styles that were valued in the past. Wilshaw notoriously suggested that heads would know they were doing their job properly if “staff morale was at an all-time low”.“This had led to intolerable workload issues and it has made it harder for teachers to see themselves doing the job for 40 years,” says Roberts. “We are losing experience and wisdom from the system. But every interaction in school ought to build up a stable and happy community in which all children are valued and adults want to work. We need a clear idea of what schools are for and we need to take seriously our responsibility to the sorts of citizens we want for the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcbbe09efe7844df0669c81f3aa7166e087c48b2/0_135_2097_1258/master/2097.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7a52347c4fe1f509833a0209f90ea35","title":"majority of european firms have no co2 reduction targets","story":"Only one in three firms have climate goals set to go beyond 2025, report findsAmong those that have set climate goals, only one in three stretch beyond 2025, according to the annual Carbon Disclosure Project report.European firms now make up half of the CDP’s environmental “A-list” and the managing director for Europe, Steven Tebbe, praised climate disclosure’s entry into the financial mainstream.“The next decade is vital if our shift to a sustainable economy is to be successful, and companies lie at the heart of this transition,” he said.One third of companies reported increased emissions.Caroline Hill, Landsec’s head of sustainability, said: “We set what was the first science-based carbon reduction target in real estate, based on what was needed in our sector to to ensure the world keeps within 1.5 to 2C of global warming.”She said the company drove down energy consumption in London offices and suburban retail parks by upgrading to LED lighting and systematically installing rooftop solar panels.This year, CDP received climate disclosures from 849 European companies in 23 countries, with combined emissions of around 2.3bn tonnes of CO2 – a total greater than the UK, Germany and France combined.Campaigners responded angrily to the inclusion on the A-list of fossil fuel firms such as Engie, Naturgy Energy Group SA and Neste Oyj, chemical firms Bayer AG and BASF, and food companies such as Nestlé.Pascoe Sabido, a spokesman for Corporate Europe Observatory, said: “If these companies represent the crème de la crème of environmentally-friendly big businesses, then we really are in trouble. “They shouldn’t be celebrated, they should be kept as far away from our policy-makers as possible.”Tebbe said: “We are not claiming these are perfect companies – far from it – but they are really going beyond the consensus and showing leadership in their sectors.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cd00a43eef45ce122a3f95ed41204280aaa30fa/0_128_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6b6a2a3c33e7570007fd42f7cad380","title":"london fashion week shafts of light to the heavy weight of history","story":"Contrasting shows from Roksanda and Erdem have immediate appealOrange is not traditionally worn with raspberry, nor caramel with tangerine, but they make perfect sense to designer Roksanda Ilinčić. “We live in a world of crazy contrast,” she said with a shrug backstage after her London fashion week show on Monday morning. “We all feel that, I think, and it creates a lot of anxiety.”Ilinčić, who begins each collection by sifting through her “precious box of colours – swatches of fabrics, images from books, postcards”, has a gift for finding beauty in the crazy contrasts. “I like putting together colours that are not supposed to go together,” she said.Burnt orange trousers teamed with a toffee taffeta tunic, finished with a coral pussy-bow flourish opened the show for her brand, Roksanda. A pumpkin trouser suit was matched with a fuchsia blouse. In between the jewel-box combinations came serenely beautiful palette cleansers in chic neutrals, like an oyster-grey soft wool boilersuit. The effect Ilinčić was aiming for was “a rainbow in a cloud”. She commissioned the London-based art trio Troika, whose Borrowed Light installation is on display at the BarbicanCentre, London, on a set where shafts of coloured light fell across a catwalk thickly carpeted with sand (or what appeared to be sand, but was actually salt) like sunset on a beach.Meanwhile at the National Portrait Gallery, Dame Joan Collins in the front row set the tone of old-school glamour for the Erdem show. On a trip to Rome, the designer Erdem Moralıoğlu visited the 1,000-room Palazzo Doria Pamphilj and became “obsessed” with the story of Princess Orietta Doria Pamphilj, who lived there until she died 19 years ago. A descendent of Pope Innocent X and heir to one of the world’s largest art collections, Orietta had been expected to become a nun but instead returned from a trip to London in the early 1960s with an adopted son.“What I liked about this story was the sense of the heavy weight of history, and how it plays out in this woman’s clothes. You can really feel this weight, in her home in Rome. There’s this moment when she has been in London at a time of huge social upheaval and returns to Rome, where she becomes obsessed with the idea of protecting her inheritance.” Photographs of her from this time show the influence of swinging London – shorter hemlines, piled-up beehives, feather trims – but “at the same time, she is sewing jewels into the lining of her coat, to carry them across borders”, said the designer backstage after his show, in between posing for photos with Collins.The backstory was a little heavy going, but the clothes were immediately appealing. The eccentric aristocrat is probably the oldest trope in fashion, but Erdem succeeded in making it fresh. There were grand-dame ball skirts and working-girl pencil skirts. Neat brooch-pinned cardigans were layered over beatnik black polo necks. Some models wore party-girl winged eyeliner, some black netted veils, and some both. Everyone wore fabulous earrings, and took the catwalk at a clip, in kitten heeled pumps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e8607fbbc65f8451e1c3b82013217bccf1d229a/0_80_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c93b950a524786b84e897bcdd45028d","title":"dont feed monster the people who have stopped buying new clothes","story":"A growing movement eschews fast fashion in favour of secondhand clothing. Is this the biggest personal change that can be made for the environment?Lauren Cowdery is flicking through the rails of the Cancer Research charity shop in Goole, east Yorkshire. “Too bobbly!” she tuts at a ribbed top. “This skirt is big but it would be easy to take in … ” Cowdery appears to be shopping, but she is merely browsing. She is on a mission not to buy any new clothes, even ones that have recently belonged to someone else. “I think you have to pull back and ask: ‘Do I need this?’” she says.So how hard is it to make the transition to a more sustainable way of shopping? In the UK, clothing has the fourth largest environmental impact after housing, transport and food. More than half of fast-fashion items are thrown away in less than a year, according to McKinsey’s State of Fashion report last year. But is buying secondhand really an antidote to fast fashion?In Goole, where Cowdery works as a marketing officer for the Junction Theatre, there are ample local distractions for a lunch break: Dorothy Perkins, New Look, Peacocks. Cowdery used to buy things “because they were there”. In the evenings, she went on Asos. “I’d think: ‘Oh brilliant, a discount code! Free shipping! I’ll order stuff! Hmm … It doesn’t fit very well, but I can’t be bothered to send it back … I’ll keep it.’”Each month, Cowdery bought two or three things. “At £20 a time, that starts to build up. There’s a wardrobe of stuff. Things with the tags still on … I took a look at myself and thought: ‘What are you doing?’”Curious about a post she saw on Facebook, one weekend Cowdery dropped into the Leeds Community Clothes Exchange, a local swap shop. Four years on, she is one of its three directors, helping to oversee the 2,000 items – “designer stuff, vintage stuff, handmade things, wedding dresses” – that pass through the doors of the Woodhouse community centre each month.Cowdery and I meet in one of those lunch hours that used to be spent shopping. Her skirt, top and cardigan are all from the Clothes Exchange her boots are from the Autism Plus shop in Goole. “At the exchange, it’s one for one on everything,” she explains. There are no value judgments. A garment is saleable if all its buttons are present and there are no stains. Some prom dresses return again and again. “People take them, wear them, bring them back.” Regulars set aside pieces for each other. The fitting room is a place of encouragement.As her involvement in the clothes exchange grew, Cowdery’s visits to Peacocks dwindled. Now, its shop floor struck her as “an explosion in a jumble sale”. She began to delete unopened emails from Asos and Topshop. She swore off buying new clothes for a year. “I thought I’d reach the end and think: ‘I’ve done that. I’ll move on,’” she says. Instead, “It changed how I thought about clothes.”Cowdery still loves clothes – especially anything velvet – but she has found a safe way to consume them. The clothes exchange enables her to refresh her wardrobe without adding to it. She can be acquisitive, as long as she relinquishes in equal measure. Where she once bought three pieces a month, she now swaps 10 to 15 – mostly things she picked up at the previous exchange.Clothes come and go at the Basingstoke home of Sarah Fewell, too. In fact, so many parcels come and go that she knows her postman by his first name (Jay). Fewell has always loved cutting up old clothes, sticking on studs, even at 14 when most of her friends were into Hollister. But now she has turned her passion for preloved clothes into a sustainable version of fast fashion.Fewell runs a shop called Identity Party on the website Depop, which since being established in 2011 has offered its 10 million users a blend of eBay-style trading with Instagram-style posting. Her brand is “a lot of 80s, 90s, quite bohemian, grungy”. She especially loves “selling things with animals on, a good old ugly jumper and anything by St Michael.”Two years ago, in the second year of a politics degree at Goldsmiths, University of London, Fewell was browsing the charity shops when she saw “a really nice dress that wasn’t for me”. She already had a Depop profile, having sold some unwanted clothes, so she bought the dress, listed it as “‘very Phoebe from Friends” and it promptly sold.She bought and sold relentlessly during her third year. “When I left university, I thought, I don’t want a real job.”Now with Identity Party, Fewell has professionalised her love of vintage.We are sitting in a cafe in a shopping mall in Basingstoke. Fewell, who is wearing an Identity Party top and jeans and an eBay jacket, runs through her working week: Monday, she posts Tuesday, she photographs Wednesday she uploads. A fourth day is spent scouring the charity shops of Basingstoke, Newberry and Reading. A fifth and a sixth on further photography and posting.Fewell’s days are long. But all the hours spent cutting out shoulder pads and removing used handkerchiefs from pockets have made her one of Depop’s top sellers. Since that first dress, she has sold more than 3,000 items, and her customer base includes her own friends, who no longer find secondhand shopping “a bit niche”.In 2017, when she posted that first dress, Fewell “wasn’t very conscious” of the sustainability benefits of secondhand clothing. “I wasn’t really thinking: ‘I could push this message.’” After a couple of months, “it got added in there”. Now she trades her “handpicked vintage gems” as sustainable fashion. Facts about clothing waste are printed on the reverse of her business cards. When a piece of clothing doesn’t suit a customer, she urges them to sell it on, to close the loop.But does Fewell ever look at the floor of her parents’ spare room – now her stock room – at the sea of pink plastic packages waiting to be driven to the post office, and think that buying and selling secondhand clothing may not be the height of sustainability? In some ways, Depop mirrors fast fashion: consumers buy cheaply and often. Fewell points out that the bags are made of recycled plastic she would like to afford biodegradable ones. “The downside, environmentally, is postage and packing,” she admits. “But people are always going to want to buy clothes. Buying secondhand is probably the best way they can do it.”The key, says Stephanie Campbell from Wrap’s Love Your Clothes campaign, is “to keep clothing out of landfill”. Each year 430,000 tonnes of clothing are disposed of and not recycled in the UK. Meanwhile, the number of new clothes sold is rising: 1.13m tonnes in 2016, an increase of 200,000 tonnes on 2012.“It’s a slow, gradual mindset change,” says Zoe Edwards, a sewing teacher and blogger who 11 years ago pledged never to buy new clothes. “It’s not like a switch goes on and all of a sudden, it’s: ‘Right, this is how I shop now.’”Edwards was working for “a very fast-fashion, low-end clothing supplier” in London. Her job was to order the trims: labels, hanging loops, buttons, zips. The quantity of delivered fabric always varied, so she had to order a surfeit of trims, a routine waste that made her uncomfortable. She had always loved sewing, selling her handmade clothes on market stalls and Etsy. Now, her two ways of living jarred.“I didn’t want to be part of fast fashion any more,” she says. She quit her job, sewed clothes, sold the clothes, taught sewing and blogged about it. In the past 11 years, Edwards has bought only “one or two things”. Her bras are new, and she thinks she may have purchased a top from Zara in about 2010. Even her knickers are what she calls “me-made”.So how difficult is it to stop buying clothes? Tania Arrayales, a self-described “fashion disruptor”, has founded an organisation in New York called Fashion of Tomorrow to advocate a more sustainable approach to the clothing industry. Arrayales was a founding member of Style Lend, a peer-to-peer clothing rental site, and swore off all clothing purchases for a year, inspired by the documentary True Cost. But weren’t there times when she was desperate to break her self-imposed rule?“The challenge was feeling a little bit … I wasn’t as trendy as I used to be. I couldn’t make an impact when I went to an event,” she says. “I didn’t have anything new and shiny. But I wanted to restructure the way my brain saw shopping.”In her second year, she allowed herself to buy vintage clothes. The year after that, she bought the odd piece of new clothing from sustainable brands. Any time she felt her style “lack a little”, she rented what she needed from Style Lend (there are lending sites in the UK, too, but this is not yet a flourishing market). “I started seeing pieces in a new light. I discovered styling,” Arrayales says.Cowdery has noticed a similar sense of exploration and play at the Clothes Exchange. “I’ve been more experimental, more free, with clothes. I don’t keep things for best. I wear them. And I don’t worry about the size on the label,” she says.The fluidity around sizing is one of the pleasures of secondhand shopping. Depop sellers such as Fewell list clothes as fitting size eight to 14. Shoppers are encouraged to view their size as variable. “That’s the great thing about swapping,” Cowdery says. No one gets depressed because something their size won’t zip up. “You just look by eye, and ask yourself: ‘Will that fit?’”Edwards has faced a similar confrontation with her personal taste. Sewing requires a lot of decision-making: the colour and weight of fabric, length of dress, shape of sleeves. She buys vintage fabric and refashions charity shop finds, but even so, she doesn’t think “sewing is necessarily the most sustainable way to dress yourself”. There is still the acquisition of fabric and materials. And a tendency to prize the making over the wearing, so that a lot of making goes on that never gets worn. “There is a big slow fashion movement within the sewing community,” Edwards says. “People are using their stash rather than buying new stuff.”The volume of clothing of all kinds – new, secondhand and handmade – is challenging. And selling on secondhand clothes has its limits. To avoid swamping the secondhand market, or passing the problem on to others, including developing countries where many used clothes are sold in bulk, other technologies, such as fibre-to-fibre recycling, need to be encouraged.“Clothing is a way to show who I am, what I feel, what I believe,” Edwards says. “It’s a way to communicate with the world. It’s got real social value, but it has got to be done mindfully.”As Cowdery says: “Clothes have a story. If you wear something once then throw it in the bin, it hasn’t had a story. You want to know there’s life in these things.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Maybe something was in the Hollywood water. Whatever the reason, 1999 yielded a bumper crop of movies about angry, ordinary men throwing off society’s shackles and finding something extraordinary in themselves.Fight Club and The Matrix purported to see past the blinders keeping everyone in line, and revolted against the sinister forces (capitalism and parasitic brain-vat robots respectively) exerting their invisible control. In American Beauty, a henpecked husband gave himself a new lease on life by rejecting suburbia for a simpler existence of weightlifting, pot-smoking, and skirt-chasing. But the most revealing film of that time, about the stifling influence of work and the evolving mores of masculinity, has to be Office Space.As profoundly unmotivated systems programmer Peter Gibbons, Ron Livingston and his don’t-give-a-shit shrug provided a generation with a hero. Writer-director Mike Judge has spent his entire career jabbing at the indignities of having a job, and in Peter he found the ideal vessel for his contempt. He punches the clock at the oppressively grey headquarters of Initech, a company whose ill-defined mission might as well be breaking the souls of its employees. It’s the most banal vision of hell: lethal doses of tedium, an unceasingly chirpy customer relations rep one cubicle over, an ineffective flow of management so dense with bureaucracy even Kafka would have banged his head against his desk. Other irritants have more of a personal sting, such as the smug pleasure boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole, doing a bargain-rack Gordon Gekko) takes in by informing his underlings that, yeah, they’re gonna need to come in on Saturday.Peter and his colleagues’ ill-conceived scheme to get rich skimming fractions of pennies from the corporate kitty gives the loose, shaggy plot a semblance of direction, but Office Space would be more accurately clocked as a character study about a man who refuses to take any more. The aggressive regular-guy-ness of Livingston empowers anyone sharing his middle-income lot – not well-off enough to enjoy being rich not poor enough to have the hardship to account for his misery – to access him as a surrogate, making his strike against the coffee-slurping overlords into a slacker wish-fulfillment fantasy.His version of getting unplugged from the matrix comes when a hypnotherapist drops dead in the middle of their session, which leaves Peter in a state of new enlightenment. It means all he must do to change direction is simply decide to do so. He starts coming to work in flannel shirts and jeans, ignoring the memos telling him things he already knows, and eventually skipping out entirely to embrace absenteeism as a philosophy. His willingness to think past the conformity of the zombies pacing the corridors catches the attention of his supervisors and lands him a promotion – perhaps Judge remembered the feeling when he realized the loathing of authority that made him unemployable could mean success in entertainment.While this critic is relieved to confirm that two solid decades of incessant “I believe you have my stapler” stammerings from unfunny men at bars have done nothing to detract from this film’s hilarity, certain aspects have aged.Early on, during a late-night gripe session with Peter, one of his pals suggests that the stability and consistency of their work may have its merit, and gets summarily dismissed. That Peter and the film itself consider a reliable paycheck a fate worse than death may baffle an 18-year-old today, reared in a world of few jobs for young people, inhumane conditions at the world’s biggest corporations, and millennial burnout. A new generation is leaning in favor of socialism to stop widespread poverty and viciously exploitative business practices. Peter’s idea of suffering is being bored – did we ever have it so good? Take a step back, and a viewer can see people growing more desperate, aware, and politicized in their rebellion.The other element binding this film to its era are the distinctly male overtones to Peter’s metamorphosis into his best self. He finds happiness by getting back in touch with the physical instincts from which eight hours under fluorescents can estrange a man. He finally ditches his unfaithful girlfriend and shacks up with a local waiter played by Jennifer Aniston, an epitome of cool to Peter for sharing in his apathy. He eventually ends up getting a new gig on a construction crew, which Judge makes out to be good, honest work. At the risk of putting too fine a point on it, Judge even splices in a few shots of Peter catching a fish. The film imagines his transformation not as an evolution, but a devolution in the direction of our primal hunter-gatherer origins.Though he’s defined by his lack of extraordinary qualities, Peter’s as much of a chosen one as his contemporary Neo. He takes it upon himself to carry the mantle of his fellow men, left flabby and neutered by the creature comforts of mild prosperity. His crusade against the tyranny of the 9-5 would refine its social component to shed the hangups about manliness, and the economic stakes would rise considerably over the following decades. But Peter remains an everyman for his particular moment, an embodiment of the Gen-X ideal, a genuine soul standing tall against sellout-ism – the dream of the 1990s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae59cfffb1da1e7c42a967ccb4d658a19e1054c8/0_372_3450_2071/master/3450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61f84a714f2a9feb98fd75583f4f875d","title":"the nine greatest oscar moments ceremony","story":"Nine decades of Oscars have brought many unexpected highlights, from flubbed announcements to streakersWhat one of the first recorded Oscar blunders – the ceremony was first held 90 years ago this May – teaches us is always, always say the surname. Or at least wait for yours to be called. Frank Capra learned this the excruciating way when presenter Will Rogers announced best director with the words: ““I’ve watched this young man for a long time. Saw him come up from the bottom. It couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy. Come up and get it, Frank!” Capra, nominated for Lady for a Day, had almost walked to the stage when he noticed the spotlight was in fact on Frank Lloyd, director of Cavalcade. He had to slink back through the crowd – with VIPs shouting at him for ruining their view – and later wrote in his autobiography: “I wish I could have crawled under the rug like a miserable worm.” He collapsed back into his chair while his table of friends wept. Hopefully, the Oscars he subsequently won in 1935, 1937 and 1939 made up for what he called “the longest, saddest, most shattering walk in my life”.Not only was Hattie McDaniel the first African American Oscar winner, for her performance as Mammy in Gone With the Wind, she was the first even to be nominated, after she placed a stack of rave reviews, including the Los Angeles Times writeup of her performance as “worthy of Academy supporting awards”, on the desk of the film’s producer, David O Selznick, who put her name forward to the Academy. The venue, the Cocoanut Grove at the Ambassador hotel, was still segregated and Selznick had to petition for McDaniel to attend. She was seated away from the Gone With the Wind table, at the back of the room. “I sincerely hope I shall always be a credit to my race and to the motion picture industry,” she said in her acceptance speech.Long before the Oscars became a platform for political causes, Marlon Brando declined to accept his Academy Award for best actor in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather. After his name was called out, a woman in traditional Apache dress rose from a seat, walked to the stage and raised one hand in silent refusal as Roger Moore attempted to hand her the statuette. She was Sacheen Littlefeather, president of the National Native American Affirmative Image Committee. “He very regretfully cannot accept this very generous award. And the reasons for this is the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry,” she said, to a mixed chorus of boos and applause from the audience.“And now to ulge the contents of this year’s important envelope,” began David Niven, in what was intended to be an introduction to presenter Elizabeth Taylor, but actually served to introduce the streaker who appeared behind Niven, throwing a peace sign, willy waving in the wind. Ever the consummate professional, Niven barely missed a beat before pondering: “Isn’t it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?” The streaker was artist and gay rights activist Robert Opel, who had managed to get backstage by putting on a jumpsuit and pretending to be an entertainment journalist.Sally Field delivered the most misquoted and possibly most relatable speech ever when she was named best actress for Places in the Heart, her second Oscar win. Flushed of cheek, she said breathlessly: “I wanted more than anything to have your respect. The first time I didn’t feel it. But this time I feel it. And I can’t deny the fact that you like me. Right now… you like me!” to laughs and cheers from the audience, who were shocked and presumably relieved to have the gaping void of need inside them briefly exposed to the light.Yes, she’s a hugely talented, multifaceted woman of some skill, but has there even been an actor, a human, as endearing as Jennifer Lawrence? As rip-your-arm-off-and-hit-yourself-in-the-face-with-it adorable? The only thing more adorable than Normal Everyday Jennifer is Awards Jennifer, who talks about eating chips on the red carpet and loses her mind at the mere sight of another A-lister. But that’s nothing compared to 2013 when, after winning best actress for Silver Linings Playbook she tripped – oh so giddily, and oh so gracefully – up the stairs. Who falls up the stairs? Awards Jennifer, that’s who. She followed up by flipping the bird in the press room. See! Adorable.There’s a variation on the dream where the entire world sees you naked, which is the entire world watching you realise you can’t say someone’s name and having to plough on anyway because it’s live TV and, actually, it’s the Oscars and you’re John Travolta. After being introduced as the “wickedly talented, one and only Adele Dazeem” in 2014, Idina Menzel (seriously, Adele?!) got her sweet, sweet revenge a year later when she welcomed her “very dear friend, Glom Gazingo” – AKA Travolta – to the stage. Whereupon he joined her on stage and, um, held her face.No Oscar acceptance speech should include the words: “I’m sorry, no, there’s been a mistake.” Yet these were the words uttered by Jordan Horowitz, producer of La La Land, on stage after he’d accepted the best picture statuette only to then be quietly handed the correct envelope, showing Moonlight had triumphed. Presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway had been given a duplicate of the best actress envelope, which had indeed gone to Emma Stone for La La Land. The world realised it had no true understanding of what a bad day at the office meant.There is no actor quite like Frances McDormand and we were never going to get a speech quite like any other when she collected the best actress Oscar for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2018. “So, I’m hyperventilating a little bit, if I fall over, pick me up…” she began lightly, before facing down the lens, jaw set: “… cos I’ve got some things to say.” McDormand asked all female nominees in all categories to stand up with her (saying, quite rightly, “Meryl, if you do it, everybody else will”) and reminded those with power and budgets in the audience that these women had stories to tell. She then uttered the words that could change representation in film forever: “inclusion rider”.Terri White is editor-in-chief of Empire magazine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

While greater first-team opportunity is viewed as the principal reason for leaving the Premier League for the Bundesliga, with Sancho, Keanan Bennetts and Reiss Nelson among those to depart in recent seasons, Klopp believes the transfer policies of English clubs is another factor.Liverpool, the manager admitted, wanted to sign Sancho but their rivalry with City rendered the deal a non-starter. Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United were also keen on the England forward before, having declined a professional contract at the Etihad Stadium, he joined Dortmund for an initial fee of £8m in August 2017.Asked about the recent trend of German clubs signing young English players, the former Dortmund manager replied: “Buying English players is a smart idea because we would never have a chance to get Sancho. We are not blind – we saw him, we liked him and then we think: ‘Can we get him?’ No. Because English clubs don’t sell to other English clubs. I don’t know exactly what the reason is for that but they don’t do it. Now they can go to Germany, which is a wonderful league.”Michael Zorc, Dortmund’s technical director, said recently that the quality of young players was higher in England than Germany at present. Klopp concurs, although he does not believe the Bundesliga has a lasting problem. “There is no dip,” he added. “Six or seven years ago you had all these boys coming up – Marco Reus, André Schürrle, Mario Götze, Thomas Müller, Mats Hummels – and it was clear when they became Under‑21 European champions it would be a generation of proper quality. It is clear that England now has that situation. It is like a wave with one country a little bit up and another country down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f684ff574dde6f4ff3e6955f30c466af5277188/494_147_1613_968/master/1613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c728cede5a76f8568b325af5f251dd0","title":"arsene wenger mesut ozil comfort zone arsenal","story":"Arsène Wenger believes the decision to offer Mesut Özil a long-term contract last year may have left the German in a “comfort zone”.Özil ended speculation about his future last year by committing himself to Arsenal until the summer of 2021, with Wenger still at the helm. But the playmaker has fallen out of favour under Wenger’s successor, Unai Emery, having started only one game since Boxing Day to bring renewed scrutiny as to whether he will remain at the Emirates Stadium.Wenger, speaking after being honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Laureus World Sports Awards, said: “I feel that the length of the contract has nothing to do normally with the selection of the team. But sometimes there are special cases. Most of the time now we think when we sign a player for five years we have a good player for five years. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that they practise, they play their best. Because they might be in their comfort zone.“He has a contract but the problem is that, if you want to buy a player like him, you have to spend £100m. And to maintain the value of the player, beyond the Özil case, it is more about the way football is structured.“To buy players of top, top quality you need £100m. So the decision you have to make is whether you re-sign the player, who costs us nothing, or do we have the money to buy a new player?”Simone Biles’ four gold medals at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships saw her overcome Simona Halep, Angelique Kerber, Ester Ledecka, Mikaela Shiffrin and Daniela Ryf to be named sportswoman of the year at the awards show.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsNovak Djokovic collected his fourth sportsman of the year honour in recognition of returning to No 1 in the tennis rankings.

The slow-burning intensity of this FA Cup tie was wrapped up in the chasing and harrying, the bundling challenges and hopeful pot-shots, until Pogba suddenly elevated himself, the game, and Manchester United’s vibrant Cup run.In a 14-minute spell at the end of the first half they carved out an unassailable lead thanks to the blend of vision, technical precision and physical force that is Pogba at his swaggering best. First, the cross: Ander Herrera set off on a sudden sprint up the right, anticipating that United might be about to unleash an invaluable weapon. Pogba with the ball at his feet on his current form always presents the possibility of a stirring touch.The Frenchman hoiked his cross beautifully into the space Herrera was fast approaching. With Marcos Alonso, a player whose form has mirrored the rise and now stomach-knotting fall of Chelsea’s experience under Maurizio Sarri, showing no sense of the runner’s whereabouts, Herrera nodded in unchallenged.Then, the smell of goal: Pogba doubled United’s lead with a move he started and finished, pinging the ball out to Marcus Rashford and bounding forward to meet the first-time cross with a header. Job done. Next round. Merci et bon nuit.Sometimes in the life of a player there comes a time when every touch, every move, every thought feels so right. So blissfully easy. It was barely imaginable that Pogba could experience that this season during the testiest late-Mourinho days, when he was dropped, stripped of the vice-captaincy and publicly demeaned by his manager.What a stroke of fortune for Ole Gunnar Solskjær that a player such as Pogba needed the kind of ready encouragement he could not be happier to give. Nine goals and six assists since the Norwegian took over is a phenomenal return. Managers who have trusted this charismatic talent, who have let him be himself, usually find themselves richly rewarded.Pogba has benefited from the structural and motivational resurgence around him in United’s midfield. If he sprinkles the stardust, Herrera and a rejuvenated Nemanja Matic are vital in sweeping up around him.The combination has established a new balance at the heart of the team that has become so effective in protecting the defence and launching attacks. Herrera’s importance was underlined not only by his goal but also by a critical block when Eden Hazard shaped to shoot midway through the second half. Matic and Herrera have arguably never played so well and that has undeniably given Pogba that extra freedom.United fared well enough with the enforced change to their forward line in the absence of Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial. Rashford’s hard running was a constant enough threat that Chelsea’s defence did not have much chance to take a breath. Romelu Lukaku barged around and held the ball up.Pogba concentrated on the less glamorous parts of the job in a second half when Chelsea tried to turn up the temperature. He organised, held some physical ground, influencing in a less spectacular but no less important way. His dominant personality seems to be so reassuring for United – something to cherish. To be suspicious of it, as his former manager was, seems more and more like a self-inflicted madness.Meanwhile, during a pivotal week for Chelsea, with a Europa League job to finish up against Malmö before the Carabao Cup final against Manchester City, Stamford Bridge is gripped by negativity. The fans in the Matthew Harding Stand vented their frustration when Ross Barkley was introduced despite their calls for Callum Hudson-Odoi.Chants of “fuck Sarri-ball” added no sugar-coating to their emotions. They booed the arrival of Davide Zappacosta as a meaningless throw of the dice. Six days before they play a cup final, loudly suggesting that their own manager was getting sacked in the morning felt like a hell of a vote of confidence.For these two managers a few metres apart in their dugouts, in their own ways both fighting to keep these elite jobs, to be given time to make a lasting imprint, appeared to be at opposite ends of the trust spectrum. Solskjær was praised to the rafters by United fans who did not want to go home. Sarri was cursed by streams of early leavers who could not wait to get out.And how telling that in this derby of sides formerly managed by Mourinho, the player he made such a public enemy of should settle it all, rising the highest, shining the brightest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3059408db9e8c4d10b241d0af80385a43bac8a4a/0_0_3036_2021/master/3036.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1e33480da5c483326ecbfb62b8de64b1 1400w","title":"tell us how did you meet your partner","story":"As part of a new series exploring romantic relationships we are looking to hear your storiesDo you have an interesting story about how you met your partner?

Taking three menus, our wine expert offers tips for happy drinking that won’t break the bankThere are a handful of obvious questions anyone should be asking when presented with a wine list. But unless – like Cristiano Ronaldo during his recent visit to glitzy Mayfair seafood restaurant Scott’s – you’re untroubled by the prospect of shelling out £18,000 for a bottle of Richebourg Grand Cru, the most pressing will always be: “How much do I want to spend here?”Being clear – and firm – about your budget will curb any urge on the part of your sommelier to – in the industry lingo – “upsell” you something you can’t afford. And, contrary to stubborn popular belief, if that budget only stretches as far as the house wine (or that ever-popular “second-cheapest wine on the list”) that needn’t mean you’re in for a night of bad plonk and disdain. Whether it’s part of a pizza chain or Michelin-starred, any decent restaurant will know that the house wines are their most important bottles, the ones by which customers will judge them. Consequently, they put a lot of effort into getting them right, and are proud of them.If, though, you’re splashing out, always beware the vintage. The majority of the world’s most expensive wines have earned their reputations at least in part through their ability to age there’s little point shelling out a fortune on a wine so young (less than a decade old in the case of the top reds of Bordeaux, Burgundy or Barolo) that it has yet to show off the qualities that will one day make it truly special.Equally, there’s no point wasting money on a gorgeously subtle wine if you’re going to swamp it with chilli, sugar, vinegar or other wine-troubling ingredients such as artichokes. A good sommelier will help you avoid that kind of clash, with the by-the-glass list (massively improved in quality, range and value in most restaurants in recent years) often the source of the most creative – and economic – solutions.But if you’re in a sommelier-free zone and on your own with the list, it’s worth remembering that some wines are more versatile than others. Lighter, fresh reds (such as beaujolais or Loire cabernet franc), richer whites (such as Rhône-style blends, whether from southern France or South Africa) and fino sherry are, in my experience, among the wines best placed to match a table of different dishes and people – without, of course, breaking the bank.Main: Pheasant, leek and truffle pieDessert: British cheeses, crab apple and oatcakesThe impeccably sourced ingredients, understated cheffy skill and carefully cultivated informality of ambience that characterise the hipper restaurants of London, Edinburgh and Manchester are perfect matches for certain kinds of modern wine.Made by people who are either believers in, or sympathetic to, the back-to-basics, back-to-the-land philosophy of the natural wine scene, these are wines that put a premium on drinkability and food compatibility: qualities not always apparent in the kind of glossy, showy, super-ripe, super-oaky tipples that once dominated the vinous mainstream.Go by the glass or pitcher, and ask your sommelier to recommend a pétillant naturel (pét-nat) sparkler from the Loire as an aperitif an orange wine from Friuli in north-east Italy or from Georgia to pair with the crab, celeriac and almond and a natural cinsault from the Languedoc or South Africa to go with the pheasant, leek and truffle pie. To finish: see what kind of age-dated sherry, madeira or marsala they’ve got to match those British cheeses.Starter: Houmous with peri-peri drizzleMain: Chicken wings in peri-peri sauceThe essence of restaurants such as Nando’s is basically twofold: chicken and spicy peri-peri sauce of various degrees of heat. And it’s the second of those two elements that would be most influential in informing what to drink in this case.Chilli heat works well with wines containing a little sugar – it’s the same principle that goes into the mixing of palm or coconut sugar with chilli in Thai and other south-east Asian cuisines. Not too much sugar: we’re not talking sticky dessert wines, which, with as much as 200g per litre, would be overwhelming. And not too light: the filigree off-dry riesling whites found in Germany’s Mosel region would be blown away by the umami and fatty richness of the chicken.I’m thinking more of the fuller-bodied kind of off-dry white styles found in Alsace, or Alsace-inspired wines made using the same grape varieties, such as pinot gris and gewürztraminer, in New Zealand, Chile, California and elsewhere.And not just in Nando’s. These are wines that work well anywhere that spice is in the mix: from your local Thai or curry house, to Peruvian, Korean and Szechuan Chinese.Starter: Coquille St Jacques in the shell with prawnsMain: Rack of lamb with herbs served with mint sauce, redcurrant jellyAccording to an age-old and generally reliable piece of wine-and-food-matching advice: what grows together, goes together. All of which would suggest that classic French restaurants demand classic French wines. Indeed, in most such places that will be pretty much all you’re offered.Given that, among others, pinot noir from coastal California, Oregon and New Zealand can be just as refined as that from Burgundy and given that you can find cabernet and merlot-based wines in Napa, the Tuscan coast and South America that live up to the best of Bordeaux, it’s worth asking if the sommelier has any international surprises (which may well be competitively priced) up their sleeves.If it has to be French, you could ask whether they have a good-quality, aged muscadet in lieu of more expensive chablis for the coquilles St Jacques, and you may find that a spicy Languedoc red will be the most economically delicious – and traditional – pairing for a rack of lamb.And to partner the raspberry millefeuille, ask for the by-the-glass list and see if they have such great value sweet wines as montbazillac or jurançon from France’s often-overlooked south-west."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/080884947fed9fdb2fe1f1193a2c29c07c7577e6/0_0_4155_2493/master/4155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e83dd735dfac7f3c12dc5255337cbd0","title":"bbc radio 4 today show should be less london centric says alastair campbell","story":"Labour party grandee says the BBC programme should cover arts and sport as serious issuesBBC Radio 4’s Today programme should be less upper-middle class and less London-centric, Labour party grandee Alastair Campbell has said, urging the BBC to use the departure of longtime host John Humphrys as an opportunity to reform itself.The agenda-setting radio show lost 800,000 listeners last year and came under criticism for not adequately representing a broad spectrum of interests across the nation, often featuring middle-class guests.“Think younger, when planning subjects and interviewees,” Campbell recommended in an interview with the Radio Times. “Think less upper-middle-aged, upper-middle class. Think less London. Think less political process and more policy. Think less ‘gotcha’ entertainment and more education and enlightenment.”Detractors regularly claim the BBC and its programmes only amplify the pages of newspapers. Campbell said Today should produce more original content and reflect what the papers say less. “Not just in the review of said papers but in the setting of the news and interview agenda too.”Sarah Sands, the former Evening Standard editor, became Today editor in 2017, and criticism soon followed, with many saying there were too many “soft” interviews on the programme and not enough hard reporting.“Gone was the questioning, argumentative tone that characterises most current affairs output, let alone the harrumphing cynicism that has come to be Humphrys’s stock-in-trade,” Campbell said.“This was peak reverence for a ‘much-loved institution’. We had giggly, flirty interviews as rival presenters from rival shows sought out the great man and he pretended to be grumpy. Hard news this was not.”However, he paid tribute to Humphrys for outstaying former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, Manchester United legend Alex Ferguson and the recently departed Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger by some distance.But, Campbell added, “not unlike Wenger”, Humphrys had failed to evolve with the times, criticising the veteran broadcaster for “opinionated snorting sarcasm” and giving hard Brexit advocates such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith and David Davis “a chummier ride” than other guests.He also recommended that the programme should start to cover arts, culture and sport as serious issues rather than using the topics as “fluffy fillers between the hard stuff”.“Think about moving or getting rid of some of the furniture. If you must persist with Thought for the Day, make it more interesting, more varied, younger, less London,” Campbell said.Though he noted his turbulent relationship with the Today programme meant he was “the last person they would listen to”, with his infamous interview with Andrew Gilligan on the show leading to the Hutton inquiry and Humphrys accusing Tony Blair’s former spokesperson of attempting to “derail the BBC”, Campbell made some suggestions for who should replace Humphrys.“Think Emma Barnett or Shelagh Fogarty or Victoria Derbyshire. Not yet trapped inside the BBCWestminster bubble. Northerners all. Quizzical not cynical. Tough but fair.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2bf126bc4f68d306e2cb3930d2953d573723176/0_273_5616_3368/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e9f191f669008cc3ffe548f7f09884","title":"the cure disintegration 30th anniversary shows to debut at sydney opera house","story":"British rock band to play landmark 1989 album in full at Vivid Live festival in MayBritish rock group the Cure will be celebrating their landmark eighth album Disintegration with a 30th anniversary live show, which will have its world premiere and Australian exclusive at Vivid Live at the Sydney Opera House in May.Released in 1989, Disintegration peaked at No 3 in the UK album charts, making it the band’s highest-charting record. Songs such as Lullaby, Lovesong, Pictures of You and Fascination Street cemented the band’s success in the United States too. By 1992, the album, described by this publication as “exquisitely morose”, had sold more than three million copies worldwide.The Cure will be playing the record with a full band, featuring lead singer Robert Smith alongside Simon Gallup, Jason Cooper, Roger O’Donnell and Reeves Gabrels.This will be the second time the Cure have played Vivid Live after 2011’s Reflections shows, at which the band played their first three albums in full: Three Imaginary Boys, Seventeen Seconds and Faith.This time, the band will play Disintegration along with other tracks from their back catalogue.Announcing the 2019 shows, Smith said: “Our Reflections shows in 2011 were truly memorable experiences, and with the excitement surrounding those early album performances in mind we are more than delighted to be announcing our return.”While the band has a series of festival dates scheduled across the globe through the year, the Disintegration shows in Sydney are being billed as a “world premiere” – but no other venues or dates have been announced.The idea for the shows came about after Vivid Live curator Ben Marshall contacted Smith directly asking for footage from the 2011 tour. While chatting, Marshall said he asked if Smith would consider performing Disintegration in its 30th year. Smith said he would love to.Marshall described Disintegration as an “immaculately glacial, majestic album marrying raw, intense emotion with some of the biggest hits of their career”. He added that the Cure’s choice of venue for their tour’s debut was “both a perfect fit and an immense honour”.Tickets to the four shows will be available via a ballot system, which is now open for applications. The Opera House says the system will “ensure everyone has an equal chance” at tickets while minimising website congestion.

Smith’s comment, however, was not addressed by the host Jo Coburn.Sarkar later tweeted: “So err, Angela Smith went a bit of a ‘funny tinge’ herself when I started asking about her record on water privatisation.”Angela Smith was soon trending on Twitter, and was criticised for her remark.Labour MP Rupa Huq said: “They claim their new party is anti-racist and modern yet in the same breath describe black, Asian and minority ethnic people as having a ‘funny tinge’. This is, at best, the casual racism of the 1970s that I thought we’d long left behind. But it will strike many as an appalling, racist comment. Is the Independent Group going to investigate?”The journalist Jane Merrick tweeted: “Really shocking to hear the Angela Smith ‘funny tinge’ comments – how does that phrase even cross your mind when referring to racism? But those involved in the Independent Group should denounce what she’s said.”Smith apologised several hours later. “I have seen the clip from Politics Live, I am very sorry about any offence caused and I am very upset that I misspoke so badly,” she said in a clip posted on Twitter.“It’s not what I am, I am committed to fighting racism wherever I find it in our society.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/914030fb618b9287be093a5c0d752515bff29a75/597_605_3270_1962/master/3270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=293b3cab2f77218e1bb0c3ab84bf45ef","title":"labour mps split a clear attempt to start a new party","story":"Hope and fury contrast as MPs begin long journey to influenceIt has no name, no logo, no staff and no money. Yet those who packed into the tiny room above Westminster Bridge as seven MPs announced they were quitting the Labour party were left in no doubt that this was the beginning of a new political party.“The crucial word is yet,” one of the MPs said afterwards. “We are not a new party – yet.”As of Monday, the group are independents with no special status in the House of Commons. They hope to be something much more concrete, depending on their success in persuading other MPs to join them.In the short term the group has one central task – to convince 29 more disgruntled MPs from any party colour to join their group. That would give them official third party status – overtaking the SNP and access not just to more “Short money” but also a prized guaranteed slot for the group’s leader at every PMQs, replacing the SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford.Those MPs involved in the new group’s organisation stress that they hope this week will be dominated by several news cycles’ worth of new developments, including an expectation of more defections. If they do not materialise, the group will find it hard to maintain momentum.Two names mentioned as the most likely Conservative targets are the Tory MPs Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston, both independent-minded and supporters of the People’s Vote campaign.The most crucial name on the list of seven is Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree who has faced a slew of antisemitic abuse including death threats that have seen more than one abuser put behind bars.Berger, who is nine months pregnant, had not often been talked about in the same breath as MPs like Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie who have been on the brink of quitting for many months over the party’s Brexit policy. Yet it was she who strode into the room first and chaired the event, looking the most like the group’s leader.The group will meet later this week to decide how to structure their group – which could involve a process for selecting a leader. Much of the future will depend how many more MPs join them.Labour MPs have been grappling with how to respond – particularly with the departure of Berger over antisemitism. One MP close to Berger suggested last week that they would find it hard not to follow her out the door.“If we have said time and again we have standing in solidarity with her over antisemitism, what does it count for if she leaves and we stay?” the MP said.Another senior Labour MP said there were several more MPs on the brink of resigning – and that 12 had originally been committed to joining the group. He said Corbyn’s reaction had basically been “a declaration of war rather than conciliatory, with no acknowledgement at all that there is a problem in the culture of the Labour party”.For now, the Labour leadership is not outwardly concerned by the resignations. Those close to Corbyn feel that the MPs quitting are hardly household names – unlike the former cabinet ministers who left to join the SDP in 1981.There is also scepticism that the policy positioning of those leaving the party will appeal to an electorate that they believe has rejected “centrist, Blairite” values.Multiple MPs said their response would be governed by Corbyn’s own reaction, including his response to deselection attempts and attacks on social media. A hardline response would prompt more to depart, many MPs said.Yet others are cautious about the effect of more resignations on the success of the People’s Vote campaign – mostly because the “People’s Vote” campaign would become closely associated with a group opposed to Labour.Pro-EU MPs are concerned at the loss of their colleagues for the organisation of the anti-Brexit movement pushing for a second referendum in Labour. The internal party WhatsApp groups have already been reorganised, cutting out Leslie, Umunna and the others who have been instrumental in shaping pro-EU arguments and parliamentary tactics.The official People’s Vote campaign moved at lightning speed to distance themselves from the new movement – despite being associated with all of its MPs. One of the MPs involved said they had not discussed their departures in official People’s Vote campaign meetings, for fear of hostile leaking.Privately, some organisers are furious and say that the splitters could irreparably damage their relationship with left-wing groups and the Labour leadership.Questions are also likely to be asked about other Labour MPs currently sitting as independents, as well as fierce Corbynsceptics who are deeply opposed to a second referendum.MPs at the launch dodged the prospect of others like John Woodcock and Ivan Lewis joining the grouping – both Corbyn critics who quit the party after being suspended over sexual harassment allegations.Frank Field, who also quit the party in disgust at antisemitism allegations and a no confidence vote by his constituents, is a determined Brexiter who has backed the government’s exit deal.At the moment, all members of the new grouping are supporters of a second referendum. Yet sources suggested this would not necessarily be a prerequisite forever. Members of the group would hardly admit it in public, but there may come a point in the next few months when it becomes apparent that that campaign has failed and the group’s aims for the next phase of Brexit become more flexible.MPs in the group are adamant they have no link to other efforts to create a new movement in the centre ground, such as the former Labour leader Tony Blair, or one under construction by some ex-Blair advisers including his former speechwriter Jonathan Powell. “If you’re going to build a new politics it’s got to be the people who are currently on the field,” one of the MPs said. “This has to be a project for current politicians and activists and people who want to build a new politics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e752c4cba36bff6c3efe82cfd10f2bdf275d5712/14_0_3471_2083/master/3471.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90304f6d0ed19d10bc23b565d00cd036","title":"now wasnt the time readers on the labour mps split","story":"You have been reacting to seven Labour MPs leaving the party and discussing what might be next for BrexitIt’s not 1981 and these MPs aren’t the gang of four. I suspect this will prove to be a bad miscalculation by Umunna et al. The ‘future of British politics’ will be one without them - which is a shame because I’d much prefer we united all of our efforts into getting rid of the vile government. Mike BarkerThe only thing that would be useful - to the country, if not the leadership of the two main parties - about Umunna et al going would be that they take a few Tories with them, and thus remove May’s majority. Theoretically at least, this could really change the direction of British politics and force a second referendum, or the abandonment of no-deal or of Brexit altogether. But if they can’t do that, this is just a waste of time and column inches. And I can’t help wondering exactly what it is that Chris Leslie sees in the company he’s keeping ... unless it can tempt away half a dozen Tories to go with them. wightpaintFinally! A centrist party that remain voters can get behind! So sick of Tory and Labour spearheading Brexit meaning no effective opposition. Let’s get real proportional representation and sort this country out in coalitions representing this ided country’s views - the only way we’re going forward together as a country is in compromise and the two-party system prevents this. Tallisker2Pretty damning. These seven will get a lot of stick rightfully so I believe, but still pretty damning for Corbyn and most sickening of all, the Tories will get a pass on the Brexit mess because of disunity like this. Not sure how these seven don’t see that, or maybe they don’t care? There probably is space for a new centrist party, but we’re facing the biggest issue in generations which needs addressing. Now wasn’t the time for this, and for timing alone these seven should be case into the wilderness of British Politics for ever. Rob BrackstoneThe “New” Labour people have no real perspective on how history will view their actions. The timing of the 172 MPs who voted to out Corbyn just after the referendum and probably cost Labour the 2017 GE and now, it looks like they are jumping ship just when we need as much effort as possible behind a people’s vote. TynebobI don’t even support Labour but this is a sorry state of affairs. Breaking away from the party offers no strategic gain. It doesn’t make remain any more likely, if anything it diminishes it. Reform only happens from within - wasn’t that the central argument of remainers in the first place? AmouxThe comparisons with the gang of four of 1981 are wrong. Yes both are a splintering caused by a hard left turn in the Labour Party. Yes, the Labour party is currently unelectable like in 1981. The more so because its handling of Brexit will lose it millions of younger votes including e.g. the seat of Canterbury.Most obviously though 2019 is different because there was in 1981 no defining political cause of the day on which to gain political energy. Brexit affords that to this new group and allows them to rehome potentially millions of voters (which the Lib Dems have singularly failed to do under an ailing leadership). Campaigning for a second vote will drive energy and electoral power to this new group, which is the calculation they have made on timing - now and not in six weeks.The second point is the age of these MPs. This is a newish generation of MPs (but with credibility from some experience). The gang of four were all past their political peak - and career trajectory matters in politics. Political change against the populists like May and Corbyn is coming from the new generation, ground up - May and Corbyn are either side of 70 and don’t recognise the need for inter-generational change. Neither are radical practical thinkers and are both in different ways intolerant of change. Any reform agenda they have is going nowhere right now - since they have both have been hobbled by their extremist wings.In this Brexit mess the political change happening now under our feet is as radical as the social change of the 1960’s, and the centrist MP’s see that. They do have a good chance. sussexplanThe Labour Party hasn’t changed since the last General Election when these MPs stood under the Labour banner. It is they who have deserted the Labour voters. They should resign as MPs and fight by-elections as Independents, but they won’t because basically they are gutless. DADAspeakThe left of the party withstood all kinds of pressure to leave throughout the 90s and beyond. Most of us stayed if we weren’t kicked out. These saps have no fortitude. I’ve been a member of the party for 22 years and have never voted any other way. There is exactly the same amount of antisemitism as there has always been in Labour, not very much. As for the hard left machine politics stuff, there was nothing more machine like than the Blair years. And if they think a broadly Wilsonian stance is hard left then maybe they are in the wrong party. Well, Good luck to them. At least they’ll have a job till the next election. But if they let a Tory in may the dead of their constituencies rise up and eat them. DrWhatsonThis is sad, very sad. Labour is supposed to be a broad church, MPs getting hounded out is not a sign of a government in waiting. And the rebels are right on antisemitism, the response from the leadership was too slow and inadequate. One gets the impression Corbyn preferred to soft-peddle when criticising old comrades. That said, this was always going to happen with Brexit. We will see a similar split with the Tories, it’s only a matter of time. Finite187Pity about the number of cynics on here. Surely this is just a symptom of how polarised politics has become and a result of loss of faith in weak leadership, that reasonable people are trying to find moderate ground. I’m all for centrism personally. You can sneer all you like of course but I don’t see much inspiration coming from elsewhere. 89798840The Tories will be loving this and what awful timing. You have to ask: ‘Why now?’. Well they should stand for re-election immediately then, but doubt they’ll do so. They would rather keep the Tories in than see a real, socialist Labour party.

Thank you.On and on and on it goes … Theresa May appealed (again) to the Commons for more time to seek substantive changes from the EU27 to the Northern Ireland backstop, which pretty much all concerned know she is not going to get.She then lost control of her party (again), suffering an embarrassing Commons defeat by 303 votes to 258 as the hardline Eurosceptics of the European Research Group abstained on a government motion because it appeared to rule out a no-deal Brexit.The loss only strengthened Brussels’ belief that the prime minister will never be able to forge a consensus in her warring party its chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told EU diplomats her strategy had “failed” and she must now work cross-party to build support for the withdrawal agreement.The European council president, Donald Tusk, meanwhile, said the bloc was still waiting for “realistic” proposals from the British government, and an EU source said the UK was merely “pretending to negotiate”.There are no signs from inside the Conservative party that the Brexit hatchet is about to be buried. May wrote to her MPs urging them to unite.But the leading pro-European MP Dominic Grieve said a dozen ministers could resign in the event of a no-deal Brexit. And the ERG have warned it will not settle for less than the scrapping of the backstop. Plus wealthy Tory financier Jeremy Hosking has registered a new party to champion a hard Brexit in a snap election amid rising concerns the Conservatives will eventually split over May’s strategy.Over at equally conflicted Labour, seven MPs - Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger, Gavin Shuker, Angela Smith, Chris Leslie, Mike Gapes and Ann Coffey – resigned from the party over Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, including his approach to Brexit and in particular a second referendum. They will sit as a new independent group.In the good news (not) department, Honda is to close its Swindon factory more than 40 former ambassadors and high commissioners wrote to the prime minister warning her Brexit had turned into a “national crisis” business leaders demanded answers to 20 crucial questions on trade a bank of England rate-setter said Brexit was already costing the economy £40bn a year and low-cost airline Flybmi collapsed, blaming Brexit uncertainty.Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, will set out how the government thinks the backstop problem can be legally solved on Tuesday, and Corbyn will meet Barnier and other EU figures to try to break the impasse and get May to back a customs union.Other than that, it’s looking increasingly like 27 February could be a defining Brexit moment. May confirmed in her statement that if by then she has still not put a revised deal to parliament, the government will table another amendable motion.She could well try to table a deal later than this, though, and many MPs worry she could either inadvertently trigger a no-deal Brexit by waiting too long for a non-existent breakthrough – or even that she may actively prefer this to a deal that would split her party.Delays beyond 27 February could trigger cabinet resignations and moves by the Commons to seize control of the process, including a new cross-party plan led by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and the Tories Oliver Letwin seeking to give MPs a vote between no deal and an extension to article 50 by the end of the month.In the , Nesrine Malik argues that Britain – a country paralysed, polarised and falling apart, yet deluded about its global status – needs a day of reckoning, and Brexit will provide it:The referendum aftermath has exposed an exceptionalism verging on delusion. It is an argument that reflects Britain’s inner turmoil on whether it is uniquely apart from the rest of the world, or cannot thrive on its own. It is a soul-searching, long-overdue questioning of the conventional account of Britain’s history. Is the country especially endowed with that historical grit and determination that helped to vanquish its enemies in two world wars and run an empire or is it a country that ran that empire by means of brutality, and only won those wars as part of an alliance? Can we go it alone? Did we ever? A humbling must come to pass. Maybe, in the end, the country outside Europe will find its stride by confronting its issues rather than blaming them on others, and forging its own way. But there is only one way to find out.Polly Toynbee says May is being held hostage by Brexit hardliners and does more damage every day she refuses to face them down:The ERG is unappeasable. It pretends no deal is a vital “bargaining chip” the EU sighs at the absurdity. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, made mincemeat of the idea that no deal is a credible negotiating position. Dominic Grieve said it was a like a three-year-old holding its breath to get its way. But this is not about “leverage”: the ERG wants no deal. Working themselves into a froth of wrath, they will never vote for anything less. Delay as she might, Tory Armageddon day will come whenever the ERG demands no deal and May finally refuses. She is not the type of thrill-seeker to relish being in charge on no-deal Brexit day. The showdown with her party-within-a party will come, so why not face them down now? She could save some credibility, after all her humiliations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f3c3b0945fc22b8dd12b1b3f3b71e9a43f1ba11/0_254_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccac2c6e40a2dcafc17a78f5550dc0e5","title":"michael gove vows to uphold food standards after brexit","story":"Environment secretary’s pledge follows fears over imports of chlorinated chickenThe environment secretary, Michael Gove, is to pledge that British food standards will not be lowered “in pursuit of trade deals”.In an address to the National Farmers’ Union annual conference on Tuesday he is expected to also vow to minimise the risk that food producers will be left at “competitive disadvantage” in the face of cheaper imports that are below EU standards.His words follow a recent warning from senior figures in the US that if the UK chooses after Brexit to adhere to EU regulations, which ban chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef, then trade talks will be difficult.There have also been warnings that high tariffs on beef and lamb imposed after the UK’s departure could wipe out some farmers who rely on exports to the EU.Gove will tell farmers: “We have been clear that we will not lower our standards in pursuit of trade deals, and that we will use the tools we have at our disposal – tariffs, quotas and legislation – to make sure standards are protected and you are not left at a competitive disadvantage.”The government is to announce its proposals for tariffs in a no-deal scenario this month. Gove’s words suggest that those plans do not entail zero tariffs.Minette Batters, the NFU president, who has been highly critical of Gove in the past, will use her speech at the conference to call for a high-level expert commission to be set up to make sure imported food meets the same standards as British produce after Brexit.“When I say standards, I mean all of the high standards British farmers observe – often at considerable expense – in protecting the environment, safeguarding animal welfare and providing safe food,” she is due to say.“Mr Gove has said that over his dead body would British standards be undermined. I don’t want it written in blood. I want it written in ink.“The issue of maintaining our food standards is critical. Which is why I am asking for a high-level commission to be convened, bringing together government officials, industry representatives, civil society groups and experts in food and farming.”Batters has frequently expressed concern that the government does not take the consequences of Brexit to the agriculture and horticulture sector seriously enough. Last year she warned that exporters would in effect be locked out of the EU for up to six months if no deal was struck. She is deeply concerned that in such a scenario the government would put trade deals ahead of farmers and says her proposed commission could deliver critical parliamentary scrutiny of terms of negotiations with other countries.“This commission needs to be charged with producing a report before the end of the year. Critically the commission would need to make recommendations on how future trade deals should be scrutinised at a high level by parliament and industry, and the government would need to act on those recommendations,” Batters is to say.“Warm words are nice but we need firm commitments and clear actions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4d42ba4a5aa3f9ed4f2cb3f8e0215681a52ff15/0_308_4854_2911/master/4854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9835b5f996778274482958ef95d923ea","title":"labour split jeremy corbyn brexit politics live","story":"Rolling updates as Jeremy Corbyn is warned that more MPs could leave party to join new groupJeremy Hunt has seized on Labour’s split, claiming to European foreign ministers it proved that only concessions to win round Conservative rightwingers will get the Brexit deal through the Commons. Brussels Bureau Chief, Dan Boffey, is reporting that the foreign secretary privately counselled his EU counterparts that the opposition could not be relied upon, even if the government pivoted to backing a customs union.The peeling away of seven MPs from the Labour party was said by Hunt during a frenetic day of lobbying in Brussels Monday to illustrate that the Brexit deal would only be saved by addressing Tory and DUP concerns about the “indefinite” nature of the Irish backstop, which could keep the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard Irish border.A full story will be live shortly.The 1980s revival isn’t being welcomed in all quarters however.The process of selecting a Labour candidate to replace Chuka Umunna will begin next week in Streatham, according to an email which the Red Roar website says has been sent out to members by Labour chairman Ian Lavery.So what do voters make of the Labour breakaway? Well, some initial polling suggests that a third of labour backers are behind them’s Josh Halliday was on the ground yesterday meanwhile speaking to constituents of Angela Smith about her decision to leave Labour. It wasn’t always pretty reading for the South Yorkshire MP.“Good riddance,” said Mick Drewry, 66, breaking off from a game of snooker as the news was replayed on a television screen nearby. “Come the next election I’d already made my mind up – I just can’t vote for Angela Smith.”Drewry, a retired steelworker, has always voted for Labour but said Smith and others had consistently undermined Jeremy Corbyn. “She certainly doesn’t support Jeremy Corbyn – she’s made that plain,” he said.Smith, the former shadow leader of the Commons, has long been a Corbyn critic, putting her at odds with many local Labour members. In November, she lost a vote of no confidence held by her local constituency Labour party and blamed the result on a “cabal of hard-left” activists.Following Smith’s announcement, the local party said the MP should “take the honourable path” and resign her seat to trigger a byelection, allowing Labour “to move on and challenge her at the ballot box”.The Business Secretary Greg Clark has put out a statement on Honday, in which he sought to highlight the company’s stated reasons -- not Brexit -- for the closure“As Honda have said, this is a commercial decision based on unprecedented changes in the global market,” he said.Needless to say, there is intense skepticism about that rationale, not least from workers at the plant who have been linking the closure to Brexit.There’s rolling coverage of what has been happening with Swindon on our business blog.The Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey has said she recognised that the decision of the several MPs to leave party was “agonising.”However, she insisted on the need for a “united front” at a time when the “Conservative government was bungling Brexit,” while crime, poverty and homelessness were rising.“Whatever people’s concerns are with our politics or the decisions that any of our front bench colleagues made on things we need to have those discussions within the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). But we also have a duty to unify,” she told the BBC. Long-Bailey also went on the offensive against the government over the Honda’s Swindon closure. While the company has said that the closure was not related to Brexit, the MP said that it was important to get to the bottom of the factors behind the decision. The failure of the government to put forward an industrial strategy that supported car manufacturers and others could be one factor, she added.The new ‘Independent Group’ of former Labour MPs is inviting anybody who wants to fix Britain’s “broken politics” to come and join them, Chuka Umunna has said.That includes Tory MPs who were fed up with what he described as the “Ukipisation” of the Conservative Party, he told the BBC’s Today programme.The south London MP, perhaps the most high profile of the several who split from Labour on Monday, came under pressure to rebuff suggestions that the new group was essentially standing on a ‘negative’ rather than a ‘positive’ platform. In other words, they oppose Brexit and “don’t like” Jeremy Corbyn and his team.Not at all, replied Umunna, who insisted that they wanted to provide an alternative that voters were crying out for, not that a new political party was immediately in the offing.“This is day two, we have only just left the Labour party. We need an alternative but you can’t cook that up in the committee rooms of Westminster,” he said.“We don’t deny we want to present people with a new alternative. It could be a new party. it could be a movement,” he said later in the interview.Umunna said that he and the others who had departed from Labour had faced a moral dilemma where they could not longer support the Labour leader and work to put him in power.The MP rejected suggestions that the new group was, “at best,” a distraction from the broader campaign against Brexit, which he has been a key part of through the moves to press for a second referendum.In a reference to some of the rows over national security policy that have engulfed Labour in recent years, Umunna also said that he and his colleagues had had a particular issue with the narratives of states hostile to the UK finding favour with some in Labour.Earlier, Umunna told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “We are not the SDP. This is a different century.” Asked when the group of MPs could evolve into a new centre party with a name and more members, he said: “I would like to see us move as quickly as possible and certainly by the end of the year, but that’s my personal view.” He added: “There needs to be an alternative, so that’s perfectly possible. But I don’t get to determine this.”Honda has confirmed plans to shut its factory in Swindon in 2021 with the loss of 3,500 jobs. The decision is not Brexit related, the BBC’s Today Programme has been told by Ian Howells of Honda.“We are in a position where out investment and focus needs to go somewhere else, it can’ be in the UK,” he said, blaming the move on the ‘global outlook’.In a statement, the Japanese firm told workers it proposed to close the vehicle manufacturing plant at the end of the current model’s production lifecycle. The plant currently produces 150,000 cars a year. The statement said: “This proposal comes as Honda accelerates its commitment to electrified cars, in response to the unprecedented changes in the global automotive industry. “The significant challenges of electrification will see Honda revise its global manufacturing operations, and focus activity in regions where it expects to have high production volumes.” Someone who has been going in the opposite direction to the seven Labour MPs who quit the party yesterday is Derek Hatton, the former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council.Speaking after it was reported he had formally been readmitted to the Labour Party 34 years after being expelled, the former key figure in the Militant Tendency told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Of course it’s good to be back, in fact in a way I’ve never left. “For 34 years I’ve stayed absolutely solid with the Labour Party. Never joined any other party, never actually voted for another party. Never campaigned for another party. ““And, believe you me, during the times of the Blair era, the Iraq war, the ending of clause four, etc, it wasn’t easy, and it was tempting to go. “And that’s why when you look at the seven who now have left you think, well, how pathetic is it, how really strong are you within the Labour movement to want to run away when there is something that you disagree with?”There’s a memorable cameo by Hatton in this clip of Neil Kinnock speaking at Labour’s 1985 conference (it was already being shared yesterday on social media) where the then leader took aim at Militant.In terms of analysis and opinion pieces today, the Times has one from Rachel Sylvester who warns that both the Conservatives and Labour are ‘on the brink’ because of isions.In these uncertain times, one thing is clear: there is a gap in the political market on the centre ground. The new independent group of MPs is the first step towards it being filled.In the , Polly Toynbee recalls her own role in the formation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) but describes yesterday’s split as a “dangerous distraction” at a time when all efforts should be behind opposing Brexit:Seven is a pitifully small number. The timing is monstrously badly judged and the reasons the MPs give are oddly scattergun, lacking political punch and focus. The Labour MP, Chris Bryant, writes in the New Statesman on why he will not be leaving the party:Unless politics is just about listening to the sound of your own voice or getting something of your chest, you have to work with others to get results. We achieve far more, as they say, by our common endeavour, than by going it alone.Sometimes that means not just putting up with strange bedfellows for a while, but shacking up long-term with people you don’t always agree with or even like. Monday’s split by several Labour MPs is prominent on the front pages this morning. Most Fleet Street titles lead with Labour deputy leader Tom Watson’s warning to Jeremy Corbyn that more resignations will follow if he doesn’t bring change to the party.Among them, the Mirror might have scooped the headline of the day:And from an editorial viewpoint that has been particularly supportive of the Labour leadership, here’s the Morning Star’s take:Here’s an overall round up of what the papers say:Good morning and welcome to the ’s liveblog coverage politics liveblog. We’ll be bringing you rolling coverage of events and stories including the continuing fallout on day two of the split from Labour by seven MPs.It’s also a day where Brexit once again looms as the Brexit secretary briefs the cabinet on the latest talks with Brussels and uncertainty about Britain’s relationship with Europe is being blamed for Honda’s decision to announce the closure of its Swindon car plant with the loss of 3,500 jobs.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to focus on Brexit during a speech (1330) at the EFF manufacturers organisation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5697b978cdd1e232bbbc28a652820f11ca109d32/0_391_4607_2764/master/4607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b18e270db415c0a6c175b056ec7f28fa","title":"alysa liu figure skating young athletes sport","story":"The figure skater is barely into her teens and is already the US champion. But some believe the mental and physical strain of elite sport should waitAlysa Liu covered her face and cried as the results were announced at the US ladies figure skating championship in Detroit, Michigan, last month. Her coach, Laura Lipetsky who has worked with her since she was five, hugged her.Liu had just won the national title at the age of 13, making her the youngest athlete to have done so, and with two triple axles no less. The weeks since have been a media frenzy. She appeared on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and profiles on her meteoric rise have been published across the world. But for all the attention Liu has received, she won’t be able to compete in Worlds. She’s too young. A 1997 International Skating Union rule requires athletes to be at least 15 by 1 July preceding the season to participate in senior-level international events.That poses a question: is 13 too young to devote one’s life to sports? How young is too young to be a full-time athlete?Liu’s childhood has been anything but ordinary. She usually trains four to five hours a day at the Oakland Ice Center under Lipetsky, who says in an email she spends so much time with Liu on a daily basis that “I feel like I am a mother to her.”At the age of 10, Liu enrolled in California Connections Academy, an online program used by other elite skaters, to allow her the flexibility to travel for competition. Liu completes her homework between practices at her father’s nearby office. She eats dinner in the car on the way home and goes to bed around 8.30pm. Despite the rigorous schedule, her father, Arthur Liu told the San Francisco Chronicle, “She has lots of friends, has sleepovers. I’m trying to provide her with a normal life.” Lipetsky says that despite Liu’s age, she does not coach her any differently. “I want all my students to be able to be the best they can at any level they are in.”There are countless cautionary tales about young phenoms burning out, leaving their sport – or at least taking a break – seemingly before their time was up. Jennifer Capriati. Björn Borg. Sonny Pike. Todd Marinovich. Pike, who was touted by some as the next Diego Maradona, described how the pressure affected him. “At 17 my head was finished. I was suicidal,” he told the  in 2016.The cautionary tales exist for good reason. Kids have different needs. Parents can be controlling, channeling their ambition through their children. Coaches can abuse their power. The pressure can be overwhelming for someone so young. But for every cautionary tale, there are prodigies who have had long careers: the Williams sisters, Magic Johnson, LeBron James. Unfortunately, there is no formula that can determine whether a young athlete with the necessary talent is ready to play a professional sport or not. “I don’t think there is a certain age,” says John Stevenson, a registered psychologist and mental performance consultant. “It really comes down to the inidual.”There are, however, some factors that can predict success or failure.Andrea Jaeger, who reached the US Open semi-final at the age of 15, recalls waking up at 5am to run in Chicago winters. “It’d be 10F (-12C), and I’d be excited to do it because I loved training,” she says.That kind of love of the sport makes it less likely a young athlete will face burnout. “That intrinsic drive is really difficult to quantify. If that’s coming from them, and not from the parent, that’s probably healthier,” Dr Charles Popkin, a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center, says.Beyond parenting, avoiding burnout is about balance. While success depends on long hours training, it shouldn’t feel like a job. Dr Stephen Smith, who specializes in clinical sport psychology for adolescents, describes the difference between deliberate practice, where the focus is on drilling and improving skills, and deliberate play, “where kids get together, sometimes with an adult and sometimes not, and they just play.” While both are important to improving one’s skills, it’s important that the young athlete isn’t just practicing the sport the enjoyment, after all, comes from playing it.Jaeger only started playing tennis at the age of eight, but by 10 she was giving interviews, and by 14, she had turned pro. “I had People Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and Life Magazine at my junior high,” she says. Now 53, Jaeger recalls having fans recognize her with her signature long pigtails in airports in Japan. Jaeger rose to No2 in the world, her highest ranking as a professional tennis player, at the age of 16. She beat Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, and Chris Evert. “Personally, for me, I was fine being 14, being a professional tennis player. The environment wasn’t ready for me,” she says. “Professional women’s tennis wasn’t ready for a 14-year-old phenom. They just weren’t.”Jaeger recalls going out on court at 1am to play a match and sharing locker rooms with grown women. She notes today’s organizing bodies are better, but she says there should be a safety system that includes background checks on adults who come in contact with young athletes. Jaeger points to the failure of USA Gymnastics to protect athletes from the sexual abuser Larry Nassar. “There’s no excuse for it,” she says. “Address the professionalism in the adults, and then maybe you’ll see these kids lasting longer.”Jaeger, for her part, faced an organizing body that didn’t understand and actively tried to dissuade her from her other passion: charity. In between matches and practices, Jaeger would often go to the local hospital and bring toys for the kids. She never told anyone what she was doing in her spare time, but when a local newspaper wrote up as story about her talking about suicide prevention at a high school in White Plains, New York, the WTA gave her an ultimatum: tennis or charity. “You have to quit doing this. It’s not helping those kids. And it’s making us look bad,” Jaeger recalls being told. She was baffled.Injuries tend to plague young professional athletes. Part of this is the wear and tear that specialization in a sport, defined as competing for at least nine months of the year, requires. When there’s no off time, there’s less time for muscles to heal. (It’s no surprise then that Liu has had multiple hip surgeries.)Popkin noticed a problem that came up time and again when treating young athletes’ injuries. After the injuries began to heal, some children would avoid their sport. “There was a psychological component to overcome as well. There were some similarities with PTSD,” Popkin says. Along with other surgeons and psychologists at Columbia University, he shared his findings in a paper this past summer. They found that young athletes who tear their ACL, have “emotional trauma, anxiety, symptoms of hyperarousal, avoidance of their activity.” The problem, Popkin says, is that for “a lot of kids, particularly if they specialize early, their identity is wrapped up in their sport.”Smith has seen the same thing. “You have someone who has just done one sport, and they don’t think of themselves as good students, they don’t think of themselves as artists, they don’t think of themselves as anything but their sport, and then they blow out a knee or they have an ACL tear, or they’ve got one too many concussions, whatever it is, then what?”For Jaeger, that point was put to her starkly after she blew out her shoulder in the first round of the 1984 French Open. After she defaulted the match, she says a reporter came up to her and told her: “You will never amount to anything ever again now that you can no longer play tennis. She now recalls: “People didn’t talk to me for years, years because I was no longer of value.”But Jaeger had other plans. “My shoulder popped, and I was like ‘OK, God decided I go help kids full time.’” It took her a few more years to leave professional tennis, but when she did, used her winnings to begin The Little Star Foundation, a charity for children with cancer she still runs today.Many people point to Jaeger as an example of a child prodigy who lost her childhood. Jaeger doesn’t see it that way. “I had a great childhood. I traveled my juniors. I went to Australia at age 10, South Africa at age 13.” Jaeger missed her prom, but “I just wasn’t that kid,” she says. “I chose to be on the circuit. I chose to turn pro. My parents did not make me do it.”For now, Liu’s season is over. Her latest trip wasn’t for ice skating, but for fun. Along with her family, friends and Lipetsky’s family, she headed to Disneyland this past weekend. “That is our tradition we have after the season is over,” Lipetsky said.When asked whether 13 is too young to compete as an elite athlete, Lipetsky says that everyone progresses at their own rate. “Age is just a number and she should not he criticized for her age … she has proved to everyone that she deserves to be a professional athlete.”Jaeger agrees. “If they’re succeeding, how can you stop them?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db9c1b2049f676eed05a0048cd07339697dfa309/0_108_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7070671b1d985e4399a79214520d2e9","title":"talking horses blaklion sale shows grand national dream is potent as ever","story":"The purchase of Blaklion is an act of pure optimism, but it is at least reminiscent of a Scottish Grand National winner of yoreI find myself thinking about Little Polveir, which is something to be grateful for. He was a game little beast who won the Scottish Grand National in 1987 and followed up in the real thing at Aintree two years later, when he led from halfway and ran on strongly up the run-in, seeing off late challenges by two big names, West Tip and The Thinker.Surely Little Polveir has also been in the recent thoughts of Darren Yates, who, it was revealed on Monday, has bought Blaklion in the hope of seeing his colours carried to victory in the National. Buying a 10-year-old staying chaser is an act of pure optimism that will never make Forbes’s list of ‘Ten Smart Things You Should Really Be Doing With Your Money’, so my hat is off to Yates, who clearly has a high opinion of this kind of horse and must therefore have been brought up the right way.Blaklion had a very fruitful early career, winning half of his first 16 races for Nigel Twiston-Davies, including the RSA at the 2016 Festival. But that kind of run is very hard to sustain and his subsequent record is 114, although the win came in the Becher Chase and he has also been fourth in a National.As much as we may admire him, Blaklion hasn’t got within 11 lengths of a winner in the past year. If you buy him, you’re taking on an annual expense of £20,000 or more, with no real likelihood of a return.But there’s the dream. Blaklion, after all, has only had two failed tilts at the National. Little Polveir was 12 and making his fourth assault on the race when he finally won it, 30 years ago, bringing great joy into the life of his new owner, who had bought him just six weeks earlier. Then again, Little Polveir only cost 15,000 guineas. Even allowing for inflation, that’s a lot less than Blaklion will have cost (unconfirmed, but believed to be well into six figures).Yates reportedly made £500,000 from a £60 bet when Frankie Dettori went through the card at Ascot in 1996 and then used the money to build a property development company, so optimism has served him well. Good luck to him and Phil Kirby, who will now train the horse.“It’s very exciting to have a horse like him join the yard,” Kirby said on Racing TV yesterday, “as the aim for us is to get the better horses and in turn go for the better races. The deal was only finalised this morning.”Kirby could be on the mark at Wetherby on Tuesday with Magic Dragon (4.00), a 9-2 shot. He scored on his handicap debut at Sedgefield last month, when the fitting of cheekpieces helped him travel quite strongly into the argument, and should have plenty more to give after a 5lbs rise. Kirby said at the time that the horse had just begun to impress him in the previous 10 days.At Taunton, Quiz Master (3.45) is of interest at 6-1 in a winnable novice handicap chase. He looks exposed over hurdles but his pedigree suggests Colin Tizzard’s charge can take another step forward on this first try over fences.Dawn Crusade (8.00) is the pick of the evening card at Wolverhampton, on offer at 6-4 to improve on her debut second in this novice race for fillies. She ran well despite greenness under a claimer on her debut and can take a step forward for the in-form Charlie Appleby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e28c31216304757109af88500afdb20acc5a72c/485_410_5173_3104/master/5173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9dec57dc5128449c5edba5e6a676923","title":"10 best roadside motels in us","story":"These revamped US motels combine modern style with retro touches and new features, such as DJ sets and yoga classesNot much remains of the Henning Motel in Newberry Springs, California. Out on old Route 66, only the once-flashing neon sign still stands, rusted beyond repair. The arrival of the Interstate Highway in the 1970s rerouted custom elsewhere, and like thousands of motels across America, its fate was sealed. These emblems of the American road seemed in steady decline, that is, until recent years, when hoteliers began to recognise the potential in their architecture and storied past, and set about repurposing them.The new generation of motels have co-opted the vintage aesthetics and mom-and-pop atmosphere of the 1950s and 1960s originals but given them a glossy finish with artisanal interiors, fancy linens, and locally brewed kombucha, or the like, catering to the values of the millennial traveller.All this comes at a price. In the 1960s a motel room was $8, roughly the equivalent of $65 today, but few renovated motels are less than $100 a night. These aren’t the motels of old with their bulletproof glass, ratty net curtains and bed bugs (which do still exist): these are motels concentrated in areas likely to draw tourists, and offering more than simply a bed for the night.* all prices include taxes and are room-onlyNamed after the Beat Generation writers whose antics added to the mythology of life on the road, the Drifter still has its original flashing motel sign outside, though a 2017 renovation saw it reimagined for Nola’s more hedonistic tourists. The rooms are small and simple, with concrete walls and white linen all the action is outside. Styled as a retro tropical resort, with palm trees, bright murals and Mexican tile work, it has a pool bar churning out frozen drinks and food trucks serve Haitian and Cuban food. There’s a pool party here most weekends, with DJs and flamingo inflatables aplenty – also, a no-kids policy.• Doubles from $103, thedrifterhotelLiz Lambert is often cited as the pioneer of the roadside motel revival, renovating her first property in Texas two decades ago. She has a knack for turning a hotel into a hotspot and the Austin Motel is no different. Reopening it in 2017, Lambert stayed true to the motel’s retro roots with lurid red-lipped wallpaper, tufted-vinyl platform beds, old school push-button phones, and silk-screened music posters. It’s tongue-in-cheek, kitsch-yet-classy (high-quality bedding and organic bath products). At its heart is a kidney-shaped pool with red-and-white striped pool bar. Tex-Mex style diner Joann’s Fine Foods opened inside the motel in 2018 and offers breakfast tacos and all-day dining (not included in room price). In continuous operation since 1938, the hotel was once nicknamed the Phallus Palace for its phallic sign, still flashing passersby to this day.• Doubles from $135, austinmotelHusband and wife Philip Sterling and Kaitlyn Canfield flirted over the idea of opening a motel on their first date, in 2014. Two years later, they’d packed up their lives in Texas … and Amigo Motor Lodge in Colorado was open. Within walking distance of the arty town of Salida, the motel is surrounded by the mountain trails, ski sites, hot springs and white-water rapids that draw outdoor enthusiasts to the state. The rooms are simple, and brightened by hand-woven Oaxacan textiles and lots of plants, while the atmosphere is casual and comfortable, more Airbnb than hotel – but with the couple on hand to help. There are also three renovated Airstreams that can be booked, a hot tub, a teepee and a fire pit.• Doubles from $115, stayamigoWhen chef Alice Amory first saw the faded six-room Seaview Motel and Cottages for sale she decided this was the life challenge she needed. Having recently returned from New York, she bought the property in 2015 and spent the spring pulling up the thick yellow carpet, tearing down fake wood panelling and slapping white paint on everything. Now, the original cabins have pretty flower-filled window boxes and bright blue doors. The design is uncluttered: rooms are decorated with photographs, an illuminated globe, and a record player instead of a television. Records and books are available to borrow from the common room, where there’s tea and coffee. The four-acre property looks out over Penobscot Bay, with a pool, barbecue grills and lawn games. Amory tells potential guests this isn’t a polished resort – and, for many, that’s its appeal.• Doubles from $105, lincolnvillemotelThe western village of Pioneertown was built as a film set in 1946 by film star and tycoon Roy Rogers, with the motel accommodating the actors. Not much had changed when brothers Matt and Mike French bought the property in 2014, but they then repurposed the 1870s-style structures into a boutique motel. The 20 rooms are kitted out by local artists with heavy textiles, cowhide rugs, and cacti. The motel hosts DJ sets and yoga classes for the creative community that has sprung up around this surreal outpost. For food, head across the road to the town saloon, Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s. Shop for vintage denim and hand-blown glass crafts on Mane Street – and then watch a staged wild-west shootout.

The Berkshires is home to the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art and the Clark Art Institute, not to mention outstanding hiking. Set in 55 acres of woodland, the motel is crossed with walkways guiding guests to the river, pool, yoga pavilion, outdoor art installations – and a 19th-century former farmhouse, which, in late February, will open a restaurant, The Airport Rooms. All-day food and cocktails are available in the lounge-like Lodge, and unlike many motels, it offers room service, too. There is also a line-up of live events and an emphasis on communal spaces. The rooms are airy and bright, with lots of blond wood and natural beauty products in the bathrooms.• Doubles from $199, touristswelcomeOriginally built to cater to the tourism boom from the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, this motel had fallen into disrepair before its multimillion dollar overhaul in 2016. Now the 42-room hotel at the base of Heavenly Mountain is an upscale ski lodge with a hint of the retro motel it once was. There’s a Tesla charging station and the rooms have Apple TVs and heated toilet seats. In the communal lobby, line up for complimentary Stumptown coffee and breakfast waffles. In the evening there’s a small bar with wine and beer. Outdoors there’s a pool, hot tubs and fire pits. Most importantly, the ski gondola is just steps away. • Doubles from $137, coachmantahoeDiscover the gateway to the rugged terrain of Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks or some of the state’s best skiing in Jackson Hole. The jump-off point is the outdoorsy town of Jackson, where the 49-room Anvil Hotel, a former 1950s motor lodge, reopened in 2017, packed to its wooden rafters with mountain charm. The Shaker-design rooms have cast-iron beds and thick, custom-designed woollen blankets, and guests are encouraged into communal areas: the lobby, which doubles as a hip take on a General Store, has a wood-burning stove and coffee from the local town roastery and the onsite restaurant, Glorietta, serves wood-fired Italian dishes and cocktails by NYC’s Death \u0026amp Co. The hotel will also help with a build-your-own adventure from a roster of snowmobiling, snowshoeing and dogsledding.• Doubles from $110, anvilhotelOnce a roadside dump with a by-the-hour reputation, this motel was boosted by the resurgence of Santa Rosa’s SoFa Arts District, including local chef Liza Hinman’s restaurant The Spinster Sisters, a Sonoma County favourite. Hinman recognised the potential of the Astro, built in 1963, and refurbished the property to open in January 2018. Hinman employed local artists for the interiors, with the LED rocket ship sign outside setting the tone, and each of the 34 rooms pop with retro colour. Local drinks and snacks are available in the rooms and the lounge offers complimentary coffee, fruit and fresh pastries every morning. Every item you can see, from the antique rugs to the art, is for sale, too.• Doubles from $178, theastroThis motor lodge is a holiday camp worthy of a Tenenbaum family retreat. The original 1940s Sunburst Motel was renovated in 2017, with a Wes Anderson-esque twee charm that appeals to younger travellers. The rooms are inspired Airstream caravans and have camper banquettes and corkboards pinned with maps and photos. Family-friendly activities include bocce, board games and hula hooping. On Maker Mondays, local artisans give craft lessons. Even the signage is cute: pool rules include, “Do not attempt duet event without partner.” Three mineral pools are fed by geothermal hot springs and there are DIY mud baths in the mud bar. There’s in-room organic coffee and free snacks in the lobby but plans are afoot for an restaurant later this year.

Barr was confirmed for the role by the US Senate last week.The Justice official said Rosenstein’s departure was not related to renewed allegations that he considered wearing a wire in meetings with Trump and using the 25th amendment of the U.S. Constitution to remove the president from office.Rosenstein, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, in May 2017 named Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate ties between Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign and Moscow. The investigation continues.A registered Republican, Rosenstein made the decision because his then-boss, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a Trump supporter during the 2016 campaign, had recused himself from the issue.Last September, the New York Times reported Rosenstein in 2017 had suggested secretly recording Trump and recruiting Cabinet members to oust the president using the provisions of the Constitution’s 25th Amendment.In an interview broadcast on Sunday with CBS News 60 Minutes, former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe confirmed the Times account that Rosenstein considered wearing a wire in meetings with Trump.Rosenstein said both the Times story and McCabe’s account were “inaccurate and factually incorrect,” which a Justice Department spokeswoman reiterated after the “60 Minutes” interview.Earlier on Monday Trump accused both McCabe and Rosenstein of planning a “very illegal act,” which he described in a tweet as “illegal and treasonous.“Rosenstein ceased overseeing Mueller’s probe on 7 November when Trump named Matt Whittaker acting attorney general.Barr now has oversight of the investigation.Rosenstein had attracted far more attention than is typical for the No. 2 Justice Department official because of his decision to appoint Mueller to lead the investigation eight days after Trump fired James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Trump has frequently and publicly seethed about the Mueller probe, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department, which oversees them both.The president has denied any collusion and Russia says there was no election meddling, despite findings to the contrary by U.S. intelligence agencies.Mueller’s investigation, which the president has repeatedly called a “witch hunt,” has so far netted 34 iniduals and three companies who have pleaded guilty, been indicted or been otherwise swept up in the inquiry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae4124514b0452174e52f7496e9eacd217785762/35_63_2266_1360/master/2266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a01d650816db3f752787e96bc473272d","title":"islamist extremism in uk shamima begum","story":"Shamima Begum says she regrets innocent people died in attacks in both UK and SyriaThe east London schoolgirl who left the UK to join Islamic State has compared the Manchester Arena bombing to airstrikes by the western allies that killed non-combatants in Isis-held areas.Shamima Begum, 19, says she wants to return to Britain and is asking for “forgiveness”, having given birth to a son on Saturday while in a refugee camp in Syria.A debate has broken out about whether Begum, who travelled to Syria in 2015 aged 15, should be allowed to return to Britain having joined Isis, which has claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks on the UK.The Manchester Arena attack in May 2017 killed 22 people after a suicide bomber detonated a device packed with shrapnel at the end of a pop concert.In the latest of a series of interviews she has given while in the camp, Begum told the BBC she had regrets about the Manchester attack: “I do feel that is wrong. Innocent people did get killed,” she said.“It’s one thing to kill a soldier, it’s fine, it’s self-defence. But to kill people like women and children, just like the women and children in Baghuz who are being killed right now unjustly by the bombings. It’s a two-way thing really.”Begum continued: “This is kind of retaliation. Their justification was that it was retaliation so I thought that is a fair justification.”Begum’s departure to Syria was seen as a propaganda triumph for Isis, but Begum has said she had not wanted to become a poster girl for the group: “I didn’t want to be on the news at first. I did hear a lot of people were encouraged to come after, but I wasn’t the one who put myself on the news. We didn’t want to be on the news.”Amid the debate about whether she should be allowed to return to Britain, it has been asked whether legally she can be stripped of her British citizenship.The home secretary has suggested rewriting the 650-year-old law of treason to make it easier to prosecute returning jihadists.Sajid Javid told the Daily  it was “worth looking at carefully” whether the ancient law could be updated to be used against British extremists. Javid has previously said he would do everything in his power to prevent those who “hate Britain” from returning to the UK. Begum took full responsibility for her decision to leave Britain, saying she alone was “the one who made the choice”. She added: “Even though I was only 15 years old, I could make my own decisions. But I will admit, it’s my fault right now. I just want forgiveness from the UK. Everything I’ve been through, I didn’t expect I would go through that.”She said while in Britain she had been lured by Isis propaganda videos about the “good life they can provide”. She had also viewed beheading videos and those glorifying Isis fighters.The father of her newborn son is an Isis fighter and despite her four years with the sworn enemies of the UK, Begum said: “I actually do support some British values.”Begum also said in the latest interview that if she made it back to Britain and was charged and convicted, she wanted her family to look after her son.Her discovery in a camp last week has highlighted the issue of what western countries should do about their citizens who are now fleeing areas formerly controlled by Isis that have been retaken by its enemies.Downing Street has rejected Donald Trump’s call for Britain to take back extremists who have fought with Isis. Trump urged European countries, including the UK, to repatriate 800 captured Isis fighters to their home countries and put them on trial. He said that if they did not the US and its allies would be forced to release them.Responding to his calls, a No 10 spokesman said: “Foreign fighters should be brought to justice in accordance with due legal process in the most appropriate jurisdiction. Where possible, this should be in the region where the crimes had been committed. We continue to work closely with our international partners on this. The government will do all it can to ensure the safety and security of the UK.”Trump’s comments were echoed by a representative of Kurdish-led authorities in north Syria where about 800 foreign fighters are being held in prisons, along with about 700 women and 1,500 children in camps for displaced people. Abdulkarim Omar, co-chair of foreign relations in the Kurdish-led region, said they would not free foreign Isis detainees but countries must take responsibility for them. He described the detainees as a “timebomb”, saying fighters could escape if the Kurdish-led autonomous area was attacked.She added: “I see lots of legal, extremist, radical content online. There is a legitimate question of freedom of speech – we must protect freedom of expression in this country – but I want to see more challenging of extremist beliefs and extremist ideology. We all have a role in that regard. Schools can play an important role in having those conversations … Faith leaders have a role in deconstructing Islamist ideology and beliefs.”Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Khan said she was concerned about what had radicalised the 19-year-old and what lessons could be learned about what attracted her to extremist ideas.“It’s important to understand when she travelled … she was aware of Daesh beheadings and executions … was becoming more religiously inclined. There are questions about how a young girl was exposed to extremist ideology – some online – and what more we can do to counter than ideology.“What support can we give to families fearing their children are being targeted by Islamist extremists?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22f9546ae00ef434ddd383c904b13ffe2fb1a9d7/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92057ecf336cd6c1a1fbdb0b5409fbb0","title":"chinese province bans app based homework save pupils eyesight","story":"Zhejiang issues draft regulation to combat soaring rates of nearsightednessA Chinese province plans to ban teachers from assigning homework to be completed on mobile phone apps as part of efforts to preserve students’ eyesight.Zhejiang, in the east of the country, issued a draft regulation last week and sought public comment. It is one of several provinces considering such measures.The regulation would prevent primary and middle school students from bringing electronic devices into classrooms without permission, restrict amounts of homework assigned and increase the time for breaks, sports and extracurricular activities.It says no written homework should be assigned to first and second graders.National education authorities have issued a proposal to prevent teachers from using the popular WeChat or QQ messaging apps for assigning homework and banned them from asking parents to mark their children’s work.The education ministry also called for only paper homework assignments for primary and middle school students “in principle”.Mobile devices are unlikely to be abandoned entirely as a means of supplementing classwork.

Plans requiring “time and patience” were being drawn up to eradicate sleeper cells, she said.She was speaking in the wake of the shock announcement by Donald Trump that 2,000 US troops will leave north-west Syria on the basis that Isis had been defeated.Ankara views the Kurdish forces in Syria as a terrorist threat and an extension of the Kurdish separatist movement within Turkey’s own borders.The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has repeatedly warned America that a Turkish military operation against the US-backed Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) in Manbij is near. “Our patience is not limitless, he said over the weekend. “If the terrorists are not removed from Manbij within a few weeks, our waiting period will end.”Ahmed said: “After all that has happened, if there is an attack, we will regard those that remain silent in the face of those threats as guilty of crimes against humanity.“It is not just there will no longer be any trust in the coalition forces who we have fought alongside, and that their credibility will have been lost forever. It will mean the emergence of very big wars in this area.“Any attempt by the Turkish state to establish a safe zone in the north of Syria will be an occupation, and no matter that the Turkish state wants to convince others that it will be a force for calm in the region, this is not what will happen.“We saw this in Afrin last year as they tried to erase our culture and remove people from their homes. Huge massacres have been committed by the Turks. A further attack will only bring more war, displacement, occupation and an attempt to destroy our culture.”An international protection force would provide aerial defence, she said, but “we would like to see an international power on the border as observers to ensure that Turkey does not attack”.The force would be composed of “states that have actively participated in the war against IS, and the UN should also play a role”, she said. She added discussions were continuing now on the size and composition of the force, but it could be a symbolic number.She also said Kurds were willing to put foreign fighters on trial in Kurdish Syria if they were given major international support on the legal procedures. “It would be better if they were tried in their own countries,” she added.She said 800 to 900 Isis foreign fighters were currently held in prison by the Kurds and about 4,000 wives and children in refugee camps. She said: “We have not said we will let the fighters go, but if the Turks attack then it is true we will be fighting for our own existence and it is possible we may not be able to keep them under control and they may return to Europe. That is also at stake when we talk about an attack by the Turkish state.”Ahmed denied the Kurds were actively discussing forming a security alliance of convenience with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, if the West decided it could not protect the Kurds from a Turkish assault.“The regime has shown no signs of interest in a meaningful dialogue with us about Syria’s future,” she said.Any such dialogue would require a change by the regime, including agreement to a political solution about the future of a federated and unified Syria."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d950208dcaf895d83ddaea9eaecdca81c91985a/0_5_2823_1694/master/2823.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f727f672498388fd74c23bb7408cdfa","title":"tuesday briefing independent group aims to scoop up other frustrated mps","story":"Warnings that more will quit Labour and Tories … British tourist and French companion missing in Australian surf … and swearing off new clothesHello, it’s Warren Murray on a morning when “leave” and “remain” have taken on new meaning in the Labour party.The seven MPs who have quit in frustration at Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership will go into the day hoping to persuade more parliamentary colleagues to join their grouping. If the Independent Group can convince another 29 disaffected MPs from any party to join them, they would gain official third party status – overtaking the SNP – and receive taxpayer funding. Those who resigned – Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna, along with Ann Coffey, Mike Gapes, Chris Leslie, Gavin Shuker and Angela Smith – attacked Corbyn’s leadership of Labour, accusing him of betraying members and the country with his Brexit stance and presiding over a party in denial of its antisemitism problem.Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, warned that “time is short for us to confront the scale of the problem and meet the consequences, to keep others from leaving … To put it mildly, we need to be kinder and gentler. I love this party. But sometimes I no longer recognise it.” There had long been rumours that dozens of Labour MPs were likely to quit but in the end the number was smaller, as some wanted to see Umunna and Berger test the water with donors, supporters and MPs from other parties. Even among those with no plans to quit, a string of Labour MPs from Yvette Cooper to Lisa Nandy have publicly made clear that they want to see change from the Labour leadership. Meanwhile there has been strong speculation that several centrist Conservative politicians are considering their future under Theresa May because of her policy towards the EU. Umunna has worked closely with Tories including Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe, Heidi Allen, the MP for South Cambridgeshire, and Sarah Wollaston, the MP for Totnes, on the push for a second Brexit referendum.Of the seven who quit on Monday, Angela Smith has the slimmest electoral majority in her constituency of Penistone and Stocksbridge. At the Legion club in Penistone, opinion appeared split. “I just can’t vote for Angela Smith,” said Mick Drewry, 66, accusing her of undermining Corbyn. But, “I think she’s done the right thing – I think they all have, the seven,” said Angela Spivey, 61, a lifelong Labour voter until Corbyn became leader. “I think it’s about time we did have a new party – I would probably vote for them if they bring out good policies.”Rosenstein on the way out – Overnight it has emerged that Rod Rosenstein – the US deputy attorney general who appointed Robert Mueller as Trump-Russia inquisitor, to Donald Trump’s fury – is to leave the White House in mid-March. It was known he would leave upon the new attorney general, William Barr, taking office to replace Jeff Sessions. But the timing of the news lines up with Rosenstein’s appearance in the news in recent days, over claims that he sounded out cabinet members about using their constitutional power to dismiss Trump from the presidency. Within the last day Trump has attacked Rosenstein, accusing him of “planning a very illegal act”.Rule out no deal, May told – Ministers have demanded that Theresa May stop using a no-deal Brexit as a negotiating tactic because of the damage being done to British business. The point has been underlined with Honda set to announce the closure of its Swindon factory which employs 3,500 people and guarantees many more jobs in the UK automotive supply chain. It has been described as a “shattering body blow” for British manufacturing. Four ministers – David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Mundell – have met with May and told her that while the no-deal threat was once a valid negotiating tactic, alarming announcements by businesses and manufacturers mean it is time to categorically rule it out. British people are shopping on, though, according to a survey – more than half have no plans to change their spending habits. The PM is expected to visit Brussels on Wednesday while the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, will soon set out what changes he considers necessary to eliminate the risk of being trapped in the Irish backstop. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, is due to brief cabinet today about his latest talks with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.Search for missing beachgoers – A British tourist and his French travelling companion have gone missing at an Australian beach during rough sea conditions. Police and emergency services are searching for Hugo Palmer and Erwan Ferrieux, both 20, after their belongings were found by walkers on Shelley Beach in New Wouth Wales on Monday. The men’s rental car was parked nearby, probably since Sunday, and police said if they had gotten into difficulty in the water their chances of survival were “exceptionally slim” as weather conditions had been “terrible”.Kurds seek protection in Syria endgame – The leader of Syria’s Kurds has called for an international force to protect her people around the Turkish border. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has warned America that a Turkish military operation is imminent against the US-backed Kurdish People’s Protection Units. “We would like to see an international power on the border as observers to ensure that Turkey does not attack,” said Ilham Ahmed, leader of the political arm of the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which have been responsible for liberating much of north-eastern Syria from Islamic State. Erdoğan views Kurdish forces in Syria as “terrorists” and an extension of the Kurdish separatist movement within Turkey’s own borders.We’ll do it Huawei – The telecommunications magnate Ren Zhengfei has declared “there’s no way the US can crush us” as the row continues over whether his Huawei company’s technology is a gateway for hacking by Chinese intelligence agencies. “The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit,” said Ren, whose daughter, Meng Wanzhou, is being kept in Canada on a US arrest warrant for fraud and sanctions violations. Washington has reportedly pressed the UK and other allies not to use the firm’s technology in critical infrastructure. Ren said: “We will continue to invest in the UK … Our company will never undertake any spying activities. If we have any such actions, then I’ll shut the company down.”Do not punch vegans – NatWest has apologised after a worker told a loan applicant that “all vegans should be punched in the face”. The Bristol customer was given compensation of £200. Her veganism came up during the phone call because she had applied for a loan for a nutrition diploma. NatWest said it was “extremely sorry … These comments were wholly inappropriate and we have commenced disciplinary proceedings.”Hoda Muthana, an American who joined Isis four years ago, now wants to return home.’s Martin Chulov describes his visit to al-Hawl refugee camp where an estimated 1,500 foreign women and children are seeking safety. And: Polly Toynbee on the split within the Labour party.“Each week we buy 38m items and 11m items go to landfill,” says Maria Chenoweth, chief executive of Traid, a charity working to stop clothes being thrown away. “We don’t have enough resources to keep feeding this monster.” In the 80s, her father banned her from jumble sales in case people thought the family was poor. So she dragged her sacks of clothes through her bedroom window.Now, Chenoweth considers it “a huge gesture of activism to buy secondhand”. In the UK, clothing has the fourth largest environmental impact after housing, transport and food – and MPs have even called for a clothing tax and mending lessons at school to reduce waste. Paula Cocozza hits the charity stores, swap shops and peer-to-peer outfit hire websites with the people who have stopped buying new clothes.Maurizio Sarri is clinging to his job after a swaggering Paul Pogba sliced through Chelsea to end their defence of the FA Cup and the home supporters took out their frustrations on the manager. After the game at Stamford Bridge, the Manchester clubs were kept apart in the quarter-final draw, with United to meet Wolves and City to play Swansea. Naomi Osaka is adamant that her surprise split with the coach Sascha Bajin had nothing to do with money but was because she refused to put “success over happiness”.Caster Semenya’s lawyers have accused the IAAF of using underhand tactics to gain public support at the start of their contentious dispute at the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne. Toto Wolff has issued a strong warning of the dangers facing Formula One and the sport’s place in the UK because of Brexit, describing it as the “mother of all messes”. Adil Rashid has said he will stick to his strengths as England’s preparations for the World Cup begin with the first ODI against West Indies. And a proposed rematch with Deontay Wilder has been thrown into doubt after Tyson Fury announced a deal with ESPN that makes it the “exclusive” broadcaster of his fights in the US.Asian shares are mostly higher in the order of tenths of a percent as Chinese and US officials prepare for trade talks in Washington this week. US markets were closed on Monday for a holiday. Sterling has been trading at $1.289 and €1.141 overnight while the FTSE is bound for a slightly higher open.Most papers lead with Labour deputy leader Tom Watson’s warning to Jeremy Corbyn that more resignations will follow if he doesn’t bring change to the party. The  leads on: “Corbyn is warned: change or more rebels will quit”. The Times has a similar take: “More resignations will follow, Corbyn is warned”, as does the : “Corbyn warned more will quit as ‘Gang of Seven’ split Labour”.Headline of the day goes to the Mirror, which puts it simply: “Splitting headache”. The i says: “Corbyn on red alert for new defectors”. The Mail has a photograph of Corbyn on his way to his allotment, with the pun “Leader who’s lost the plot”. The drama also made it to the front of the Scotsman, which borrows a line from the Independent Group’s presser: “Politics is broken”. “MPs despair at Corbyn stance” is the picture story on the front of the Financial Times, which leads on the Honda plant closure.

Some pastors take worshippers for full immersion baptisms in the cold of the Thames Estuary. Others believe that when congregants suddenly start speaking in unknown languages it marks the presence of the Holy Spirit.But the researchers from the University of Roehampton found things that many churches have in common, including a drive for professional advancement, a commitment to spend three hours or more at Sunday service and typically very loud worship.“That is how we express our joy and gratitude to God,” says Andrew Adeleke, a senior pastor at the House of Praise, one of the biggest African churches in Southwark, in a former theatre.“The church is not supposed to be a graveyard,“ Adeleke says. “It is supposed to be a temple of celebration and worship and the beauty is to be able to express our love to God, even when things are not perfect in our lives.”For some, the noise from amplified services is a problem, leading to complaints to local authorities from residents.But many churches face bigger challenges than unhappy neighbours: some provide food for people struggling to make ends meet, or work with young people at risk of recruitment by gangs.With clubs, churches and motorcycles, Berlin becomes home for migrantsAndrew Rogers, who led the University of Roehampton researchers, says pastors have to juggle retaining the churches’ African identity while appealing to children of first-generation immigrants, many of whom have never lived outside Britain.They typically have a more liberal world view which can be hard to reconcile with conservative Pentecostal teachings.Rogers recalls speaking to one pastor who lamented he was unable to talk about religious miracles to his children.“If the church doesn’t adapt, then they are going to leave and look elsewhere,” Rogers says.Reporting by William Schomberg, ReutersWe’ll tell you what’s true.

And they could be as big a change as when the wires dropped out of Apple\u0027s existing headphones and they were first born.Introduced in 2016, the two truly wireless earphones haven\u0027t been updated since. They came with a wide range of futuristic features – but a range of rumours have swirled around them about new updates, that would bring new and even more futuristic features.The AirPods are actually two (or three) different things: the case that protects them and the earphones that sit inside. Until recently, they\u0027d be considered one and the same – but recent leaks have suggested that Apple might update the two separately, with different release dates.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAccording to recent rumours, the new case is likely to arrive earlier, and maybe soon. It could even be a part of Apple\u0027s March event. The actual release date is probably dependent on when Apple releases the AirPower mat that it\u0027s charging could rely on.The earphones themselves are likely to undergo a more dramatic reinvention. But that could also take longer to arrive.

And most of the rumours focus around how exactly it would do that.New AirPods charging case could come before updated earphonesMost likely, the biggest change in any new case would be the addition of wireless charging. That would allow them to charge up just like a phone, being able to be plonked down a wireless charging puck and then transfer that into its battery as well as the AirPods themselves.Apple has actually teased a new case before, when it announced the AirPower wireless charging mat. It said that a new case would be needed to allow the AirPods to be charged through that new product – but then the new product never actually arrived.The company did say then that the case would be updated but that the existing AirPods would be compatible with the new one. And people would be able to pay a reduced price just to buy the case and update, it made clear – an offer that will presumably stay around with the new earphones.Another rumoured change includes the addition of a new and grippier kind of plastic, which should make the box easier to hold. And if as suggested Apple does introduce new colours of AirPods, such as black, presumably the case will also change colour too.But it\u0027s the earphones that have most of the technology. Rumours have suggested that a whole host of new (and sometimes strange)\u0026nbspfeatures could be coming to the new earbuds.The most likely feature – in part because it\u0027s been apparently revealed by Apple\u0027s own software – is always-on Hey Siri. That will mean that people don\u0027t have to do the uncomfortable move of tapping their own ears to wake the earphones up, and instead just say Hey Siri any time they\u0027re wearing their AirPods to speak with the voice assistant.Other rumoured updates including new health tracking tools. Apple has been keen to get into those features with technology like the Apple Watch, and the inside of people\u0027s ears is a great place to take readings for things like heartbeat and temperature, which could happen with future AirPods.Apple is also likely to improve the performance in less obvious ways. The new buds will probably feature better wireless connectivity, and improved waterproofing.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Since then, prices have slid on a consistent basis, only recently showing moderate signs of recovery.These optimistic price movements, combined with a strong volume of apprximately $27 billion in the market, may well suggest that the long-awaited bull market is not far away, Mati Green, a senior market analyst at the online trading platform eToro, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Still, until bitcoin sees a strong breakout above the psychological level of $5,000, the longest bear market in cryptocurrency\u0027s short history continues.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But Esma said recognising London’s clearing houses would “limit the risk of disruption in central clearing and to avoid any negative impact on the financial stability of the EU”.A report for the London Stock Exchange in 2016 found that up to 83,000 jobs related to clearing could be lost in a worst-case Brexit scenario.Created with Sketch.

The different social positions of the interaction are exaggerated by the visual dimensions, with passer-by almost always standing above, leaning over, talking downThe European Commission put forward proposals in 2017 which would impose stricter supervision of clearing houses by EU central banks and Esma, and in some cases force bigger organisations to move operations to the bloc.However, moving euro clearing would be costly and complex which experts predicted would make transactions more expensive and the financial system less safe.Why an area ‘showered with EU cash’ still thinks Brexit is a good ideaClearing houses are a crucial part of the “plumbing” of the financial system. They act as middleman between buyers and sellers of derivatives – financial contracts tied to the underlying value of a share, index, currency or bond.Buyers and sellers deal with the clearing house\u0026nbsprather than each other, absorbing losses if one counterparty fails to pay up.This helps to prevent a domino effect of losses spreading through the financial system when one company defaults.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The different social positions of the interaction are exaggerated by the visual dimensions, with passer-by almost always standing above, leaning over, talking downThe European Commission put forward proposals in 2017 which would impose stricter supervision of clearing houses by EU central banks and Esma, and in some cases force bigger organisations to move operations to the bloc.However, moving euro clearing would be costly and complex which experts predicted would make transactions more expensive and the financial system less safe.Why an area ‘showered with EU cash’ still thinks Brexit is a good ideaClearing houses are a crucial part of the “plumbing” of the financial system. They act as middleman between buyers and sellers of derivatives – financial contracts tied to the underlying value of a share, index, currency or bond.Buyers and sellers deal with the clearing house\u0026nbsprather than each other, absorbing losses if one counterparty fails to pay up.This helps to prevent a domino effect of losses spreading through the financial system when one company defaults.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all.

ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHRumours have been swirling about potential headliners.Janet Jackson, Taylor Swift, Fleetwood Mac and Paul McCartney have all been named as possible options, though no official decision\u0026nbsphas been announced.In 2017, Fatboy Slim claimed in an interview with\u0026nbspNME\u0026nbspthat Glastonbury is becoming “less dangerous” and “more middle-class”, adding:\u0026nbsp“It used to be quite a hairy place to be at times.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct.

Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable.

The phones will keep the Lightning cables they have been powered up with for years, allowing owners to keep their existing accessories despite continuing rumours Apple could one day move to using USB-C.The feature would not be entirely new: the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is already able to pass its battery to other phones, with a feature that the company calls reverse wireless charging.Created with Sketch.iPhone XS launch in September 2018 Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS MaxTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event 211 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launchTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc311 Tim Cook speaking during the event411 Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketingPhil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max511 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XRPhilip W.

The main upgrades will include tools that allow the phones to use precise indoor positioning and navigation, a frosted glass casing, better Face ID facial recognition, and bigger batteries.The biggest new feature however is said to be a triple-lens camera, which is endorsed by the new report and has been widely rumoured. That will allow the phone to include a wide, telephoto and ultra-wide lens system, the new report claims.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That was first shown off in 2017, as a wireless charger that could power up AirPods, an iPhone and an Apple Watch at the same time – but despite the promise it would come soon, nothing has been said about it since, and some have even suggested it might not be coming at all.The AirPods themselves will also receive an update.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today.

While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.“Tom and I are working hard and Sorkin loves it, and obviously it’s his creation and I had such an amazing time on it,” Munn said. “There’s been so much that has happened in the news and in media that we could really speak on, and it’d really be interesting to see what his take would be on it and what The Newsroom would do today.”Munn added that, having earned a journalism degree from the University of Oklahoma, she valued the show’s treatment of the media.\u0026nbsp“And as somebody who went to journalism school and has such love for journalists and media, it was to me that show was always a love letter to journalists, showing the struggles of what they go through to really tell the stories they want to tell,” she said. “So, I hope, we’ll see. We’ve been working. Tommy and I have been doing our due diligence with Sorkin, so we’ll see.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Therefore any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the six months that should be remaining for travel to most countries in Europe.The \u0027blue\u0027 passport, like Brexit, is an international embarrassmentCombining these two rule changes means that\u0026nbspthere are some passports out there which could be rejected even though they expire 14 months and 29 days after the date of travel.\u0026nbspHowever, these rules do not apply when travelling to Ireland. To try to eliminate any confusion, the government website has a new passport checker service to see whether\u0026nbspyou should renew your documents or not.If the UK leaves with a deal, travel to the EU should\u0026nbspremain the same as now until at least 31 December 2020.That would mean\u0026nbspUK passports would\u0026nbspbe valid for travel anywhere in the Schengen area (the vast majority of EU countries as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) up to and including the expiry date.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

They’re from different backgrounds but are united in their belief that we can #ChangePolitics.”Will there be by-elections?If an MP resigns from their party but wishes to continue on as an independent candidate\u0026nbspthere is no formal requirement for a by-election to be held.\u0026nbspLabour sources have been reported as saying the departing MPs should submit themselves for by-elections as they were elected on a Labour manifesto.Responding to a question about holding elections Mr Leslie said “by-elections are absolutely not what is needed right now” due to the “national upheaval” that has been caused by Brexit.We’ll tell you what’s true.

To confront the scale of the problem and meet the consequences. To keep others from leaving.”One source involved in the split on Monday told The Independent that other MPs\u0026nbspwere close to quitting and would follow depending on what happened over Brexit in the coming weeks.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn his statement, Mr Watson said that “a virulent form of identity politics has seized” control of Labour, and said Mr Corbyn’s team now must “reflect the balance of opinion” across all MPs in the parliamentary party.He also lashed out the “hard Left”, who he claimed “can be too easily tempted into the language of heresy and treachery”.It came after the MPs faced a wave of abuse in the wake of their decision to leave, including fellow MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle who compared them to “cowards”.The Young Labour twitter account posted a line from the party’s anthem, The Red Flag, reading: “Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we’ll keep the red flag flying here.”I’m a Remainer but I feel betrayed by the defecting Labour MPsWhy an area ‘showered with EU cash’ still thinks Brexit is a good ideaShadow chancellor John McDonnell called on the breakaway group to do “the honourable thing” and fight to retain their seats, while Unite union boss Len McCluskey hit out at the “splitters” who had “no stomach for a fight for Labour’s core values”.The decision to quit the party had been the result of months of soul searching for the MPs, with one telling The Independent: “I’ve been getting out of bed every morning for the past two years thinking, ‘Shall I resign from the Labour Party today or tomorrow?’”The most recent Brexit votes on 14 February appear to have been a tipping point for some angered by Mr Corbyn’s reluctance to support a second referendum.One source in the breakaway group said: “We were looking at the amendments that the Labour Party was putting down and hoping, I was hoping anyway, on the 14th we would have had a little more movement on a People’s Vote but in fact we ended up going backwards and it wasn’t referenced at all.“Clearly a lot of us have had issues with the leadership of the party going back quite some time ... We tried everything to save the Labour Party.”Mr Corbyn’s response to the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal also “crystallised” concerns, another MP said, arguing they were not prepared to sponsor a government led by him.As she resigned, Ms Berger said Labour had become “institutionally antisemitic”, while Mr Gapes, a former chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, told the press conference Labour is now a “racist, antisemitic party”.Corbyn accused of ditching Labour’s Brexit policy by party delegatesHe added: “Jeremy Corbyn and those around him are on the wrong side on so many international issues – from Russia, to Syria, to Venezuela. A Corbyn Labour government would threaten our national security and international alliances.”Mr Umunna called on MPs from Labour and other parties to “leave the old tribal politics behind” and join the new independent group.He said: “It is time we dumped this country’s old-fashioned politics and created an alternative that does justice to who we are today and gives this country a politics fit for the here and now, the 21st century not the last one.“We’ve taken the first step in leaving the old tribal politics behind and we invite others who share our political values to do so too.”As well as other Labour MPs, there has been speculation that some Tories may consider joining the new group, with several facing deselection moves in their local associations due to their soft-Brexit stance.Among those is the Tory MP for Grantham, Nick Boles, who said: “They’re all good people and I understand completely why they felt driven to leave Labour.“I have not spoken with any of them about their plans and am totally focused on working with MPs of all parties to stop a no-deal Brexit on 29 March.”Work now begins in earnest on framing what the Independent Group stands for and how it will be run, with its first meeting due in the coming days.A source said they needed to get moving quickly or “the machines of the existing parties are going to come after us in a very significant way”.“It’s D-Day today”, the MP added.Sources were keen to emphasise their independence from pro-EU campaigns such as People’s Vote and also from prominent figures like ex-Labour prime minister Tony Blair – despite their support for a Final Say referendum.Scant detail has emerged about how the group is going to be funded, apart from a crowdfunding page which crashed when the announcement was made.Asked whether they had union funding, one MP said they respected the union movement but joked it was “nice to be free” as most were run by a “tiny clique”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But Amy could do nothing about this, for the woman who had punched her in the face and kicked her as she lay crumpled on the floor was her master, and Amy was her slave.Shes one of an estimated , victims of slavery in the UK, who live alongside us unnoticed - washing our cars, painting our nails and cleaning our neighbours houses, hiding in plain sight up and down the country. And when slaves do manage to escape from their masters - , were rescued in Britain last year - they are shockingly only entitled to  days of help from the government.Which is why The Sun is today launching a campaign to Stamp Out Slavery, in conjunction with Co-Op, backing Lord McColls victim support bill, which proposes to extend support given to rescued slaves from  days to one year.Here, speaking exclusively to Sun Online, Amy, now , tells her story.Domestic slavery might sound like something out of a Victorian novel, but last year alone  people, like Amy - including  children - were rescued from domestic servitude across Britain.As her story proves, almost anyone can be forced into slavery.Amy, an -year-old orphan, was bursting with excitement when she flew over to the UK from Ghana.After the death of her parents in , she was befriended by a lovely woman called Mary who offered to take her to the UK to become a nanny.She tells Sun Online: “My parents died and suddenly I was alone. I dropped out of school and had no-one.She says: “She knew I didn’t have family and was a hard worker, so she got me a passport paid £, so I could travel over. I was going to look after her five-year-old daughter and I couldnt wait.“Because of the money she’d spent, I felt like I owed her big time.”But within days of arriving in the UK, Amy realised all wasnt as it appeared and it soon became clear that she wasnt here to look after Marys child.Once in the UK, Marys tone changed and she made Amy sleep on the floor with no duvet or mattress.Within a week, she was forced into working -hour shts cleaning Marys flat - and went days without eating.Amy says: “I went through hell.She told me I had to sleep on the floor. Her friend offered me a free mattress, but she said I didn’t deserve it.The only clothes I had were hand-me-downs and I slept about four hours a night. She didn’t want to see me sleeping -she was in the house and awake I had to stay up just in case.“I’d sneak one or two meals in when she was out - I’d have eggs and rice, just cooking leftovers.Every day I had to hand wash all Mary and her daughter’s clothes and I wasn’t allowed to use the hot water.“I was trapped and felt suicidal.”Sobbing as she remembers her ordeal, Amy says that Mary pimped her out to strangers who came to the flat.“Within a month she began to let men sleep with me.It happened twice a week - men came over, paid her a handful of notes, raped me and left.The first time it happened it was really bad. I told her I couldn’t do it and she said I could, because I’d already been raped.If Amy didn’t do as she was told, she was threatened.Amy says: “She took my passport and told me to stay away from the police, andI talk to them she would stab me with a screwdriver. So I just did what she asked.”After  months, Amy reached breaking point.One day while Mary was out, Amy seized the opportunity and found courage to flee, frantically breaking down the lock on the front door.With nowhere to go, she ended up homeless. But sleeping rough on Londons streets seemed like a better option than spending another day under her mistress tyrannical rule.   A few months later, Amy bumped into Mary on the street.Amy says: “She slapped me and demanded I collect my belongings. Then she called the police, who called immigration.”Now, Amy lives in temporary accommodation in the Midlands, supported by The Sophie Hayes Foundation, a charity set up to help victims of trafficking.She says: “I don’t trust people. I don’t sleep properly and am on antidepressants. For a long time, I wanted to take my own le. I didn’t see the point of living in this world.Sadly, stories like Amy’s are far from unique. Elvira, , from the Philippines also arrived at Heathrow in  and was taken to a luxury flat in London’s Kensington where she was forced to work  hours a day.“I had to work all the time, without a day off, and I slept on the floor by her bed,” Elvira toldin .  “My mistress would shout at me, saying I was stupid or call me a “dog”. I was given just a piece of bread and cup of tea for the whole day. I became emaciated. I felt like a slave, like I was in prison.”She wanted to run away but her captors had her passport.One morning, when he employer went for a nap, she found the keys to the door and ran.

It repeats endlessly that the withdrawal agreement is closed and that it isn’t going to reopen it.When the Brady amendment passed the House of Commons, saying Parliament would accept the dealthe backstop was replaced, the EU responded by saying they didn’t think this Parliament majority was “stable”.Thursday night’s vote helps them make that argument.As one No source laments: “We don’t want to give the Europeans a chance not to engage with us.”I understand that when the Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, dined in Brussels this week Sabine Weyand — the EU’s deputy negotiator — spent her time telling him that a customs union was the only major change available to the backstop.The EU think that Corbyn’s support for it means that a customs union could pass Parliament. I am told Barclay attempted to disabuse them of this idea.Mrs May can’t entirely escape blame for this week’s fiasco.No should have made sure that its own MPs were happy with the wording before publishing the motion.“She’s like a football team that can’t string two wins together,” complains one minister.But the Tory Brexit ultras should have paid more heed to the real-world consequences of their actions.Another effect of Thursday night’s defeat for the Government is that it increases the chances of the Cooper amendment passing on February .This would compel the Government to seek an extension to Article Mrs May hasn’t won Parliament’s support for an exit deal by March .One Cabinet minister, with close links to several of the ministers who might quit to ensure this amendment goes through, tells me it is now “much more likely” to pass.This Secretary of State complains that the Government’s defeat “makes it harder to make the argument that we should hold our nerve” as “the best evidence for holding your nerve was that the outcome would be the same as when the Brady amendment went through”.Another minister warns: “If she doesn’t come back with something cooking by the th, there’ll be trouble.”I understand those around Mrs May know they need to have shown progress by the th.One insider tells me: “If the Government doesn’t want Parliament to take control, they need to have a plan.They can’t just sit there for two weeks.”Other Cabinet ministers aren’t so sure Cooper will pass.One tells me: “I don’t think the ministers will resign, andthey don’t resign, then it doesn’t pass.”If Cooper does go through, politics will enter into an even more unpredictable phase. One May Cabinet ally is predicting a general electionthis happens.But it is hard to see how a general election could end in anything other than disaster for the Tories in these circumstances.If Mrs May is forced to ask the EU for an extension but with no Parliamentary agreement in sight, the EU is more likely to offer a long extension than a short one.I understand the view in several EU capitals is that the longer the extension, the more likely it is that the political dynamics in the UK will change.But a long extension would prolong this damaging, political uncertainty.This Government, and this Parliament’s, job is to get Brexit done. Time is running short. Both Parliament and the Government need to get their act together.But it may well be because the NHS – traditionally Labour’s strongest suit – is not the most important issue in politics right now.But that number is down to  per cent this winter, according to the pollster Ipsos Mori.The question now is whether the Tory decision to spend an extra £billion a year on the health service by  leads to a decline in public concern.But in January AE departments recorded their worst waiting times since the figures started being collected in .Matt Hancock, the new Health Secretary, is setting up a new NHS-X unit to try to bring the health service into the digital era, which would help the NHS to better use its resources.There are many things the Tories have to do to win the next election – not least, deliver Brexit – but they must also reassure voters on the NHS.Butthey can be ed they should be subject to the full force of the law.Justice must be done and must be seen to be done.Churchill wouldn’t have been Prime Minister but for the Labour Party’s willingness to serve in a government led by him.When it came to the crucial decision to fight on in , Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood, two Labour members of the War Cabinet, were more solid than some of Churchill’s Tory colleagues.But Attlee and Greenwood came from a very dferent Labour tradition to McDonnell: They weren’t Marxists or Trotskyists.There are some Labour MPs who are just not prepared to try to put into power people who are so outside the traditional bounds of the party.One minister likens the coming Tory leadership race to the  Grand National, when a crowded field led to a pile-up at the rd fence and the victory of the - outsider Foinavon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t believe they’ll get a No Deal exit either, and eventhey did the short-term chaos would kill their party.Instead Parliament would postpone Brexit, possibly finishing the Tories for a generation. This current purgatory would go on for months longer — maybe long enough for Remainers to reverse the referendum result.The Government would have failed in its only mission. It would instead have undermined our democracy and ensured bitter isions that would never heal.The one person unable to compromise, oddly, is the Prime Minister. Because what Brussels, Labour and Tory Remainers glibly ask of her, a permanent customs union, ALSO wrecks her party and destroys Brexit’s economic case.It was folly to expect the Tory ERG group to vote to “take No Deal off the table” on Thursday night. Logic was on their side, at least.But they need to think hard now how they will feel on March Brexit is put off and they are blamed. If they have opened the door to a toxic, anti-Semitic, anti-Western Labour rabble so crazed by ideology they cannot even allow Winston Churchill’s historic defeat of Nazism to trump his other failings.A party committed to massive tax rises, maybe even a  per cent windfall levy on anyone’s “wealth”. A party led by pension-age Marxist revolutionaries friendly to Putin, Hamas, the IRA and hard-left dictators but hard on private enterprise, job-creation and free speech.We sincerely hope Labour moderates stop dithering and resign to undermine Corbyn and McDonnell.

And it was an old-school print journalist, the brilliant Anthony Loyd of The Times, who found Begum in a Syrian refugee camp containing almost , people.Loyd’s interview with her is a gripping insight into the twisted mind of a British youngster who ran off to join IS’s murderous caliphate. And the BBC had bugger all to do with it.While BBC staffers were sipping their skinny lattes and nibbling almond croissants in Broadcasting House, a journalist from The Times got his scoop the hard way, tramping into a chaotic refugee camp in one of the most dangerous parts of the world.Why does this matter  Because this country has one of the most vibrant newspaper industries on the planet.And the bloated, over-funded BBC is KILLING it.The Cairncross Review, a Government report into the future of UK journalism, revealed this week how tax-dodging tech giants Facebook and Google, together with the publicly-funded BBC are annihilating our free Press.They have already destroyed what was once affectionately known as “the local rag”.Over the past seven years, hundreds of local papers have shut down and thousands of regional journalists have lost their jobs. , journalists worked on local newspapers in  — now it is just ,. And it is your money that bankrolls the BBC.At a time when the BBC is contem­plating ditching free TV licences for the over-s, the debate we should REALLY be having is about how much of your money we should be chucking at Auntie.We have a great newspaper industry and it is worth preserving.Because it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story of MPs fiddling their expenses — it was a newspaper . And it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story about charity Age UK receiving £million from an energy company to flog gas and electricity to pensioners — it was a newspaper .It wasn’t the BBC that dared to publish the names of the killers of Stephen Lawrence — it was a newspaper .And what was the most-read story on the BBC last year  Strictly minx Katya Jones snogging Seann Walsh  — a Sun on Sunday exclusive.The BBC, like Facebook and Google, is a parasite that lives off the flesh of real news-gatherers.What makes the BBC dferent from the tax-dodging tech giants is that we love it. And you can’t grow up in this country and not have a deep and abiding affection for the BBC.I have endless happy memories of the BBC — from Match Of The Day to Top Of The Pops, from David Attenborough documentaries to The Likely Lads, from Fawlty Towers to the Hairy Cornflake.But the BBC has got far too big, far too bloated and far too wealthy.Lord Reith, the visionary behind it, wanted our state broadcaster to “inform, educate and entertain”. Lord Reith never dreamed of a state broadcaster that was all-powerful.The BBC gets far too much of your money and spends it far too easily. Why does the BBC need to be over every nook and cranny of the internet To the generation growing up on Netflix and YouTube with an entire universe on their smartphones, the BBC pocketing more than £ a year from everyone with a TV set is absurd.The BBC has got too big for its publicly-funded boots.That’s what we should be talking about — not the merits of free TV licences for granny and grandad!The Cairncross Review told how the BBC’s expansionist online empire has come very close to destroying the local newspaper industry.Are we really going to keep giving the BBC £billion every year so it can do the same to the national newspaper industry In the same week as the Cairncross Review came out, Bruce Sharma, , fought off thieves armed with a hammer and a machete with just his rolled-up copy of The Sun.Bruce was reading The Sun in Ram Stores in Long Eaton, Derbys, when the hooded pair burst in demanding money. “Instinct took over and I tried to whack them with the paper,” says Bruce.You can’t do that with a TV licence.GORDON Banks lit up my childhood.For my generation – a wide-eyed kid on that magical summer’s day in  – those World Cup winners will always feel like family.Gordon never got a knighthood.

The gaping wounds left by this internal conflict could soon prove fatal to him.There were sharp intakes of breath yesterday when seven moderate Labour MPs announced they have resigned to set up a new Independent Group.Their number may be small — and none of them, except perhaps Chuka Umunna, may be household names — but their move is certain to have a huge impact on British politics.It throws the Opposition into chaos.  Beleaguered by dismal poll ratings, serial incompetence, isions over Brexit and accusations of extremism, Corbyn will now come under brutal pressure.The Gang of Seven’s decision to quit will feed into the narrative that he is a Marxist mediocrity, whose toxic spell at the helm since  has not only dragged his party to the lunatic fringe but has also allowed vicious anti-Semitism and intolerance to flourish.The seven splitters made precisely those charges yesterday, using language that  will be gleefully exploited by Labour’s opponents.Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree who has endured death threats and deselection attempts from socialist zealots, said she would be “sickened and ashamed to remain in the Labour Party” because of the  “culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation”.Equally powerful was Chris Leslie,  the Nottingham East MP, who argued that Labour had been “hijacked by the machine politics of the hard Left”, peddling “abuse and hatred”.Labour’s turmoil follows the battering that Corbyn received in a new book by investigative journalist Tom Bower.With a wealth of shocking details, it exposes the full scale of the Labour leader’s dreary left-wing fanaticism, his links to anti-Semitism, his anti-British instincts and his low intellectual calibre.As the book graphically demonstrates, never was there any politician less fitted for the premiership.Given the y charge sheet against Corbyn, it is amazing that the party split did not happen earlier. But the moderates hung on in the forlorn hope that Corbyn might change or that Labour might move back towards the centre ground.There was never any chance of that.Corbyn and his dogmatic followers are not interested in compromise or debate — only in enforcement of their warped ideology.  They have turned what was once a broad church into a narrow personality cult.In fact, many Corbynites, like a kind of Trotskyite Taliban, welcome the split because they see it as an opportunity to rid the socialist creed of impurities.“Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we’ll keep the Red Flag flying here,” screeched the infantile Young Labour movement.Yet the charge of cowardice is an absurd one to make at the splitters.It took courage to quit. Most of them had relatively safe Labour seats. Yet they have put their political careers and livelihoods at risk in protest at Corbyn.In addition, they will be forced to endure a barrage of abuse from party members, since Labour is a profoundly tribal movement, where betrayal is regarded as the darkest sin of all.But this will only be the start of a major rebellion against Corbyn.To the Gang of Seven can be added three other moderate former Labour MPs who already sit as Independents, namely Frank Field, Ivan Lewis and John Woodcock, who describes Corbyn as “a clear risk to national security”.Public interest in the new group is strong. By early yesterday evening they had gained , followers on Twitter.And more Labour MPs are likely to resign, emboldened by the Gang Of Seven.  It should be remembered that in  no fewer than  Labour MPs —  per cent of the parliamentary party — openly declared their lack of confidence in Corbyn’s leadership.Tellingly, Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader, said in a bitter swipe at Corbyn yesterday that he “no longer recognised” his own party and merely condemned the defections as “premature”.Even with its modest beginnings, the Independent Group launch represents the biggest split in British politics since the formation of the SDP in , when Labour was lurching to the Left under Michael Foot. But the parallel with the SDP also highlights the weakness of the new group.The SDP was headed by the big figures of Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Shirley Williams, all experienced Cabinet Ministers and potential premiers.There is no one remotely of that stature among the new Independents.Their most high-profile member, Umunna, briefly ran for the Labour leadership in  but withdrew at the first whf of media scrutiny.Nor does the Independent Group have a coherent set of policies beyond being anti-Corbyn and pro-EU.In contrast, the SDP had a clear stance in favour of Britain’s nuclear deterrent, Common Market membership and the market economy.The splitters’ claim to be standing up for democracy is also weakened by their reluctance to accept the result of the  EU referendum, the greatest democratic exercise in British political history. Indeed, in their Remoaner posturing, there is an unpleasant air of the narrow, metropolitan progressive elite about their operation so far.Nevertheless,they help to prevent the election of Corbyn, they will do a service to British politics, just as the SDP helped to halt the advance of Foot almost  years ago. If the new Independent Group is really to reshape the British political landscape, it will have to be far more than just a narrow, elitist breakaway from Labour.A burst of anti-Corbyn hype is not enough. To become an authentic third force that dominates the centre, it will have to attract MPs from other parties.That means taking over the increasingly moribund Lib Dems, now led by the ineffectual Sir Vince Cable.More importantly, it   requires winning over Left-inclined Tories and anti-Brexit MPs such as the noisy Anna Soubry and the former GP Sarah Wollaston.Gaining Conservative support was precisely what the SDP failed to do, ultimately dooming it to failure. Just one Tory MP, Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, became a Social Democrat.Gang of Seven member Gavin Shuker said that Labour had “turned its back on the British public”.He is absolutely right — which is  why Corbyn’s mob must not be allowed near power. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Refusing to “talk about particulars”, Mr Hatton, , confirmed “processes have happened”, adding: “I am a member of the Labour Party.” He said: “During that -odd years that I was expelled, I never once stood against, supported, voted against any Labour candidate.“It’s very topical it should be at the time when seven members resigned today because obviously there were times when it was very tempting to go a dferent way - during the Iraq War, loss of Clause IV, many things - but I believed then as I believe now the Labour Party is the political arm of the trade union movement. “Whatever is happening, that’s the place to stay.” Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said: “I’m happy to have Derek Hatton back in the Labour Party. “What happened in the past was a product of its time, but he has now committed himself to the kind of sensible socialism that we’re doing here in Liverpool and want to see UK wide.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jewish mp ruth smeeth tears","story":"NewsJewish MP Ruth Smeeth in tears at sombre first meeting of Labour MPs since  quitMPs at the meeting said she was “very upset” and “distressed” as she claimed her friend Luciana Berger had been forced out of the partyShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video watch-highlights-labour-split-speeches-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth wept as she accused party chiefs of doing too little to tackle anti-Semitism, at a sombre meeting of Labour MPs.Jeremy Corbyn’s remaining critics in Labour vented their anger at a tense meeting after seven MPs quit to sit as independents. MPs at the meeting on Monday evening said Ruth Smeeth was “very upset” and “distressed” as she claimed her friend Luciana Berger had been forced out of the party. One added: “She said she had raised the case of a member who’d said she and [fellow MP] Louise [Ellman] didn’t have human blood. “And she raised it months ago and the person is still a member of the party and has not yet been suspended.  “The specic thing wasn’t addressed at all.” Witnesses at the meeting said Stella Creasy complained she was sick of “warm words” and the “constructive dismissal” of MPs. Luciana Berger, who has suffered an onslaught of anti-Semitic abuse, was one of seven MPs who quit the party to sit as independents in the House of Commons. Ms Berger said she was embarrassed and ashamed to remain the Labour party which has become institutionally anti-Semitic, and ridden with a culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation. Other MPs in the group also cited the leaderships handling of anti-Semitism as their reason for quitting.  But they also spoke of Mr Corbyns handling of Brexit , his foreign policy decisions alongside his opposition to business and his leadership more generally.Speaking after the meeting, Labour MP Ian Austin said Luciana Berger had been “driven out” of the Labour Party. “I think constructive dismissal is a pretty good way of summing this up,” he said. He added: “If that’s the response from the leadership, it will make the situation much worse. I think you could see more people considering taking the same course of action. “I think a lot of people will be reflecting”.Askedhe was pushed any closer to joining the Independent Group, Mr Austin - a serial critic of Jeremy Corbyn - said: “I think people will be thinking about what’s happened today and over the last weeks and months.”Labour Party chair Ian Lavery addressed the meeting, denying Labour was “institutionally anti-Semitic” and saying Jeremy Corbyn was disappointed at the MPs leaving.  But Labour MP Louise Ellman claimed Mr Lavery’s speech made things worse because he “just didn’t seem to understand” the enormity of what happened. “He said he was disappointed. He implied he was disappointed with them [the MPs] and people should stay in the party”, she said. “There was no reassurance at all the Labour Party’s going to deal with it.” Ms Ellman said she was “just as concerned” as the MPs who quit the party, but she would stay and fight from within. One MP burst out of the PLP meeting complaining: It was a complete an utter waste of time. Just talking rubbish. Another witness said the meeting was “sombre”, with MPs repeating calls for action that have been made for months. “It was like Groundhog Day,” the source said.

Current legislation requireNHSClinical Commissioning Groupsin England to tender out any contract worth more than pound,.  TheNHSlong-term plan suggested there should be changes to the rules outlined in the  Health and Social Care Act, which Labour said have led to an increase in the number of contracts awarded to private companies such as Virgin Care. This Health Secretarys privatisation credentials become clearer by the day, whether its promoting GP at Hand to endorsing private dentistry to now allowing millions of pounds worth of health services contracts to be privatised, Mr Ashworth is expected to say.  But when evenNHSbosses are calling for the very worst aspects, the so-called section  provisions, of the Tory Health and Social Care Act to be binned surely Mr Hancock should step in, block these tenders and instead guarantee the contracts remains in public hands. Otherwise his promises to the Health Select Committee will be exposed as entirely hollow and it will be clear the ToryNHSprivatisation agenda continues to run rampant. The contracts currently out to tender include one worth pound,, to run anNHS clinical assessment centre for Kent, Medway and Sussex CCGs. The research for Labour, carried out by the House of Commons Library, was correct as of February .

The seven MPs who walked away from the party yesterday ide opinion and passions are high, but the only winner is May herself. What happens next is crucial, more Labour MPs ripping up party cards to join what is calling itself an Independent Group would be another gt for the Conservatives. Labour should first consider why the seven departed to avoid others following, addressing grievances on Europe and anti-Semitism in the hope of uniting the party. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell’s call for MPs to stand again in by-elections, now they’re against the party which got them into Parliament, is, alas, likely to be rejected.   The prospect of a Labour government is a little more remote today and the Tories a little more secure as a result of the split. Surely that can’t be good for working people. What car-nage Honda shutting its Swindon factory is a terrible car crash for workers, their families, local businesses, suppliers, motor manufacturing and the British economy.

The split in  continues to cast a dark shadow over the party. Then, as now, a group of moderate MPs left in protest at the party’s shyleadership, the infiltration by the hard left and isions over Europe. Then, as now, the splitters promised to break the mould by changing the “broken” way of doing politics. In the end they only proved the dficulties of establishing a new political force under our first-past-the-post electoral system. In , the SDP-Liberal Alliance got . million votes, a shade below Labour’s . million, but won  seats to Michael Foot’s . By , the SDP was wound up following the creation of the Liberal Democrats.  Many in Labour fear history could repeat itself with the “gang of seven”. The lesson they draw from the creation of the SDP is that a new party will split the Labour vote and hand the Tories the next general election on a plate. Angela Smith said yesterday that comparisons with the SDP do not “stand up to scrutiny”.  “This is a dferent century and the challenges that the country faces are on a scale that I don’t think we have seen at any other time in the post-war period,” she said. There is no doubt that Brexit is testing traditional political allegiances. Many voters now identy themselves by how they voted in the referendum, rather than by which party they tend to support.  But it is far from certain this upheaval will lead to a redrawing of the political map. Historian Dr Matt Cole, from Birmingham University, said: “The inidual MPs have a steep hill to climb, it is rarely successful. “The culture of British politics is one in which the main political parties, however unpopular they are, nonetheless are incredibly resilient. “They are like a company that nobody likes the products of, but they can’t stop buying them.” The two main parties’ joint vote in  was the highest since , he said. There may be, as Ms Smith said, a large number of people who feel politically homeless. But evenyou provide then with a new house the chances of breaking the two-party monopoly are slim.  Unlike in , the seven dissident MPs cannot claim to be political heavyweights. The founders of the SDP included Roy Jenkins, a former Chancellor and Home Secretary, David Owen, a former Foreign shySecretary, and Shirley Williams, a former Education Secretary. The highest rank achieved by Chuka Ummuna was shadow Business Secretary under Ed Miliband. At the moment, the Independent Group lacks all the components required to form a new party – a grassroots base, money and a distinct agenda. The MPs were brutally honest in saying what they were against: the failure to tackle anti-Semitism the hard Left’s grip on the party machine the lukewarm opposition to Brexit.  They were less clear when it came to spelling out what they did stand for. But this does not mean the Labour leadership has nothing to fear from the breakaway. The centrist seven could be joined by other MPs, including Conservatives, and their message may shyresonate with disillusioned Labour councillors, activists and voters. Which is why many expected a stronger response from the Labour leadership to the most serious fracturing of the party in almost  years. It was moment when the party’s MPs and activists looked for reassurance and direction. Instead, Mr Corbyn issued a tersely worded statement expressing his disappointment and sent an email to members urging them to stay united.  There should have been, at the very least, an acknowledgement that the criticisms made by the departing seven would have chimed with many Labour MPs and supporters. Those who may still quit need to hear from the Labour leader why they should stay. It was left to Deputy Leader Tom Watson to try to articulate the mood of a dismayed and anxious party. His warning that unless things change others could follow the seven out of the door was a direct challenge to Corbyn. Labour could only prevent others from leaving, Watson said,we “reach out and extend beyond our comfort zone”.  There was also a more veiled message that the leadership needed to listen to the Parliamentary Labour Party on Brexit. It was noticeable that in his email to party members, Mr Corbyn reaffirmed that the option of a second referendum remained on the table. Some believe that unless he follows through on this demand then other MPs could join the nascent Independent Group. How the leadership responds will be a major factor in determining whether the breakaway MPs are a flash in the pan or a new movement. If allies of Corbyn turn viciously on the quitters they will confirm their reasons for leaving and could encourage others to follow.  The leadership must ask itself why moderate MPs feel they can no longer stay in the party and respond to concerns about Brexit and anti-Semitism. At stake is Labour’s chance of winning the next election. In dozens of marginal seats the Independent Group could split the opposition vote and allow the Tories to keep power. The legacy of the SDP was to force Labour to sht to the centre, where elections are usually won or lost. Today’s seven MPs may have decided to sacrice their careers for the same ambition.

At the time, he didnt know who was responsible, but said his family were shocked when they saw the video and realised it was a doorman.  Liam added: The police officers were screaming saying I was resisting. I was saying Im not resisting. I was in a cell for  hours. It was scary. I have never been arrested before.

It’s posh and full of snobs.”So that evening I mentioned this to the audience, and a woman shouted, “It’s true, they are posh – they’ve even got theirown dentist.”Incidents like this led to the Radio  show Mark Steel’s in Town, in which I visit a town each week and write a show about it, performed to a local audience. This is why I’ve encountered attractions such as Hebden Bridge, the scenic Yorkshire town so famous for its lesbian community that the manager of the tourist office told me a woman came in that week, striding past brochures for coach trips and rambles, and said, “I’ve heard this town is full of lesbians, so I want you to find me one.”  A few miles away, the people of Stockport are immensely proud of the  night bus route, on which they insist every journey entertains you. One discussion went, “Does that bloke still get on with no shirt, always carrying a rabbit ” – “Of course he does, he’s the driver.” Stockport also shyexperienced a plague of wild peacocks. No one knew where they’d come from, but they were sat on cars, screeching on fences, and the local paper quoted one woman saying, “It was terrying. One came into the kitchen and knocked over a kettle.” In nearby upmarket Wilmslow, Cheshire, where soap stars and Manchester United footballers live, I found a leaflet in an estate agents, advertising a bungalow for poundmillion, which said: “This bungalow boasts one feature not found in any other bungalow in the area: it has an extra floor.”Sometimes it feels asthe area puts on a show on purpose. When I visited shyBirkenhead, Merseyside, someone suggested I go to a local bar called Moodz. It was a long thin room, brightly lit, with a dozen people drinking on their own, facing forwards and scowling, while one man rode up and down in a mobility scooter. Then Come on Eileen by Dexys Midnight Runners came on the jukebox, and a woman of about  stood on a table and sang along to it very loudly. The man in the mobility scooter stripped down to his pants, then stood up, trying to dance while clinging to the bar. The woman came down from the table, whipped off his pants, they sang “too-ra-oo-ra-ay”, while no one  took the slightest bit of notice. The producer of the radio show nudged me and said, “And it’s only half past seven.”  Almost every town has a rich tradition of protest. So everyone in Walsall, West Mids, seems to know Sister Dora – the Victorian nurse who transformed hospitals by campaigning for them to be kept clean – who has a statue in the town centre. And all of Hull knows Lily Bilocca, the woman who led the campaign for safety laws on trawlers, whose face is on a vast mural by the docks. But in the genteel Durham town of Barnard Castle, there was fury because British Telecom installed a small green box on a pavement. One woman said: “I was delivering the church newsletter and wasn’t looking where I was going so I nearly walked into it.” But they were determined to resist. The local paper reported: “A group of knitters are threatening to produce a tea cosy to cover up the cabinet... However, having considered their tea cosy protest, fear of getting into trouble with the authorities is making them think twice.” It’s like reading about the struggles of Nelson Mandela.  Some of the proudest areas are just outside cities. Don’t suggest to someone from Paisley they’re a part of Glasgow. You’ll face abuse that goes, “We’re nowhere near Glasgow, we’re at least two miles from Glasgow, I don’t even know how I know it’s two miles away as I’ve never heard of Glasgow.” In a pub in Paisley I was told of the time a dog’s jaws locked around a man’s testicles. The police were called but action was required urgently, so a passer-by whacked the dog with a baseball bat. Later the police said: “It was lucky this happened in Paisley, as it’s the only place you can shyguarantee there’ll be a passer-by with a baseball bat.” On the surface, modern Britain looks increasingly unorm and soulless. Every town has its shyidentical shypedestrianised precinct, Tesco Expresses, and out-of-town retail parks with Homebase and identical staff and pot-plants. But in Portishead, the shypersonality they asked to turn on the Christmas lights was Nigel who worked in Homebase, “chosen above TV stars, for his cheerful demeanour and helpful attitude”. By the end of the series, I’ll have been to  towns, and every one has been packed with enthusiastic people who adore their town, because each place is ridiculously gloriously dferent. Because it’s only in Hastings that businesses can have names such as “ waxing for men”, and a builder called “William the Concreter”.Mark Steel’s In Town, Radio , Thursday, .pm.

Christopher Finch, , said the tat is so dire it will cost thousands to repair and that no legitimate artist will touch his “car crash of a tattoo”. Mr Finch, from Plymstock, Plymouth, said he wanted to get the skull and cross bones on his upper arm covered with an image of the Grim Reaper. His mum put him in touch with a man she knew who claimed to have “ years experience”.He took her word for it and arranged for the supposedly qualied tattooist to come and get him inked, reports Plymouth Live.However, it turned out the man, who since disappeared, was a barely qualied apprentice at a local tattoo joint, and despite spending nearly five hours working on Mr Finch’s arm, the results were disastrous.   He left after telling Mr Finch he’d be back to finish the job, but is now AWOL. Mr Finch said: He said he had  years experience in tattooing I let him come to my familys address. I genuinely thought he was legit. I let him do the job, I gave him pound upfront and he buggered off and hes left me with that. I spoke to the shop where he was supposed to be from and they said he wasnt supposed to be doing this, he was only an apprentice. The amount of complaints this guy has had is unbelievable.  My mum was good friends with him - she said he did tattoos for a living, he had his own business. This is obviously what he told her. Unemployed Christopher says his benefits have been stopped so hes broke and cant afford to get it right. Joe said: I am so sad and angry about it. I dont know what to do or where to turn.  Im urging everyone to avoid this guy. Becauseyou do get a tattoo by him, it will be a bad one. Itll look like a nine-year-old has scribbled over you. Thats what hes done to me - it looks like a nine-year-old has drawn all over my arm. There are specic laws around tattooing which everyone in or thinking of getting into the profession must abide by. The most basic of which is everyone practicing the profession must obtain a licence. And there are restrictions on where you can actually ink someone, depending on the terms of your licence.

He was due to stand trial at Kirklees Magistrates Court over the October  incident. But he was excluded by court security after hurling abuse at female court workers and pulling down his trousers in front of them. Prosecutor Lydia Pearce said that Folans bizarre rampage kicked off at .am.  She told magistrates: “The defendant was outside the Wetherspoons and picked up the barriers and swung them around in the street, causing alarm and distress to members of the public. “He picked up ashtrays and tables and threw them at people and vehicles. “Then he picked up chairs and threw them into the road, causing disruption. “He was shouting and swearing and members of the public were caused to fear the defendant and that they would be subjected to violence.” Fiona Louhunane who works in the building next to the pub was heading for her lunch break when she saw the commotion outside.  She told magistrates: “I became aware that articles were being thrown around in the street. They were heavy metal poles that support the cordon around the pub. “They were being thrown about by a person I know to be Mick Folan. He was very erratic and unpredictable as he moved around. “There were a lot of pedestrians - old people and people with pushchairs - about and I was quite concerned that somebody was going to get badly hurt. “He threw chairs at taxis and jumped into the road in front of traffic and a bus. “I was worried for other people because the tables and poles are metal and heavy.” Ms Louhunane said that she went into the pub to alert staff and dialled .

He got hold of the metal pole and threw it into the middle of the road. He then threw another one then the third one which tripped him up. “He was in the middle of the road and shouting very abusively, shouting f****g this and f****g that. “I was frightened that my car would get hit by the ashtrays he was throwing.

The phenomenon will see the moon come closest to the Earth during its monthly elliptical orbit, and as a result will appear much bigger and brighter than normal. Weather forecasters have warned that cloudy and overcast conditions on Tuesday could leave many stargazers disappointed, particularly in Scotland and the north of England. Some of southern England will remain clear and dry, meaning it may be the best place to see the so-called super Snow Moon . Emma Smith, from the Met Office, told the Mirror: Rain coming in from the west will make it a wet day for many access the UK. It really will be quite overcast tonight although there may be some breaks in clouds for those on the south coast.  There will be persistent rain in northern England, Scotland and Wales with heavy downpours of up to mm in higher areas. The Met Offices forecast added: After a chilly start there will be sunny spells for many. Dull, wet and windy weather will develop over Northern Ireland though, spreading into Scotland, northwest England and Wales later. It will be wet and windy at times across the north. For southern areas it will stay dry though, with some clear spells in the far south.  ASupermoonis a celestial wonder because it is when the moon can appear nearly % brighter and almost % larger than a typical full moon, said Slooh astronomer Dr Paige Godfrey. It is one of the few nights a year when people really notice the full moon rising. The Moons closest approach will bring it within , kilometersof the Earth, otherwise known as perigee. Thats about , kmcloser than it was two weeks ago, during the apogee, when it was , kmfrom the Earth.  During theSupermoon, the effects of the moons gravitational pull on the Earth’s oceans will be more pronounced, generating higher than normal high tides, known as Spring Tides. In early Native American tribes, the February full moon was known as the Snow Moon because the heaviest snow fell at this time of year. It was also sometimes called the Hunger Moon, because the snow made hunting dficult, or the Crust Moon, because the snow cover becomes crusted from thawing by day and freezing by night. The more northern tribes of the north eastern United States knew it as the Crow Moon, when the cawing of crows signalled the end of winter.

However, one mum-to-be recently made an adorable faux pas which is a new one on us. Lori Farrell headed to work dressed in what she believed to be a smart, stripy maternity skirt. It was only when she later Googled the brand that the penny dropped. Looks nice, doesnt it   Except, despite having extra material to allow for a growing bump, this wasnt a maternity skirt. Not even close. Instead, Lori was proudly sporting a baby car seat cover. The brand responsible for the car seat cover seat, Itzy Ritzy, werent the only ones who found it very funny. Speaking to Motherly , Lori explained:  A friend of mine had given me a huge lot of baby stuff, from clothes to baby carriers to a rocker and blankets and when I pulled it out I was not sure what it was. I debated it but washed it anyway then decided because of the way it pulled on the side it must be a maternity skirt.  When I got to work I googled the brand and realised not only do they not sell clothing but it was a car seat cover. As the responses show, Lori is not alone in making this sort of error.   I once let my husband borrow what I thought was a warm headband for a chilly outdoor event. Turns out he wore my black tube bra, added one woman.

The woman in her s, from Guiyang, China refused to accept she was giving birth after being brought in to a hospital with abdominal pains. Doctors say that the educated woman, who was excessively overweight , had not noticed that she was pregnant because of her size. They added that she was genuinely surprised that she had ended up with a baby when hospital staff told her. She then complicated matters by insisting medics carry out a virginity test first before carrying out a C-section. The incident happened at a hospital in Guiyang, capital of Guizhou Province, according to Guiyang Evening Post on February .  The woman ended up in the hospitals emergency department after she was helped there by her parents and medics were stunned to learn that she was completely oblivious to the fact that she had started contractions - and was now going into labour. When the obstetrician broke the news, the patient in her s reportedly said: Impossible. Its not possible that Im pregnant!   The physician, who declined to be named in the report, said: She demanded that we perform a virginity test on her. It was very frustrating. According to hospital staff, the woman was adamant she could not be pregnant because she doesnt like men and has never had a boyfriend, much less sex. When her doctor asked whether it could have happened during some sort of drunken blackout, the patient claimed she was allergic to alcohol and doesnt touch booze. Medics suggested the woman was overweight, with her physique apparently masking the fact that a child had been growing in her womb for nine months. There was nothing more we could say to convince her that she was going into labour, the doctor said.   The hospital agreed to perform an emergency C-section on the woman and she gave birth to a baby boy on February , the second day of the new lunar year. However, the newborn was handed to the womans parents after she refused to nurse him. According to reports, the woman lives alone and, because of her weight and irregular menstrual cycle, never noticed she was pregnant. None of her friends noticed either. The hospitals head of obstetrics said: Its not the first time weve had a mother who only realised she was pregnant right before giving birth. They are usually underage and lacking in knowledge about their physiology. But this patient is in her s and was educated, so were particularly surprised. The report did not say whether the patient planned to give her son up for adoption. It is currently unclear who fathered the child.

Its one thing to kill a soldier that is fighting you, its self-defence, but to kill the people like women and children... Just people like the women and children in Baghuz that are being killed right now unjustly, the bombings. Its a two-way thing really.  Because women and children are being killed back in the Islamic State right now and its kind of retaliation. Like, their justication was that it was retaliation so I thought OK, that is a fair justication.The mother-of-three, who gave birth to her third child at the weekend, left east London with two friends in  to join the terrorist group. She was partly inspired by videos of fighters beheading hostages and partly by other propaganda films showing the good le IS could offer.  Since she has been there, she has had three children, two of whom - a boy and a girl - died in infancy.She gave birth to a boy on Saturday who she has named Jarrah .The teenager insisted she did not ask to be the subject of international media attention. She said: I didnt want to be on the news at first. I know a lot of people, after they saw that me and my friends came, it actually encouraged them.  I did hear, yeah, a lot of people were encouraged to come after I left but I wasnt the one that put myself on the news. We didnt want to be on the news.

He told BBC Breakfast: The family have gone out of their way from day one to try to get her away from the IS narrative and the context which she finds herself in.

I jumped at the chance to come down here.”And the -year-old sees the draws against Hamilton and Kilmarnock since he arrived as proof this is a squad that can pull away from the relegation zone between now and the end of the season.“The only frustrating thing for me so far is that we’ve not taken six points out of six from the two games I’ve been involved in but I think all the fans and us as a team can feel from those performances that we are building momentum.“In the Hamilton game it was a case of everyone trying to get used to each other. A lot of us had only come in right before the deadline and we only really had one training session together.“It was about trying to get to know everyone’s games, their personalities. I think we are all starting to gel now and you can see that on the pitch.“Not having a game last weekend because we’re out of the cup has given us a bit more time to work on that. That gives us a better picture going into the game against Livingston this weekend.”Today’s trip to the Tony Macaroni Arena to face Livingston is a meeting with a team who have taken the Premiership by storm this term but have been struggling for a win of late.Since thumping Hearts - in mid-December, Gary Holt’s team have not won in eight outings. Wright does not see that as a sign this could be an easy  minutes for Dundee.“We have to treat it that every game from now on is going to be a big game for us and this will be.“We know how Livi will be and they will work hard but all we can do is just prepare the way we want to and work on how we can play. Hopefully, that will be enough.“They haven’t won in a few games but it’s a testimony to Livi how many points they have. They started the season so well.”Today, of course, will see Dundee asked to play on Livi’s much-criticised plastic pitch.The debate over their use has surfaced again this week via the PFA canvassing their members for views on them. While Wright is very much in the camp that prefers grass surfaces, the articial surface is not something he’s going to gripe about.“All we can do is get on with it and we are not going to use the pitch as an excuse,” he added.“Playing in Scotland, you get used to them.“However, I think having everyone playing on grass is something that would benefit the top league.“You prepare for a team each week but, for these games, you also have to prepare for the pitch as well.“All we can do as players is give our opinion about them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee railway stations bike park criticised for opening hours","story":"Tayside#s regional transport board is to discuss Dundee train station’s new bike park after cyclists complained its opening hours did not align with the timetables of services.Members of the Dundee Cycling Forum say the hours of the new bike park are incompatible with the first and last services of the day.At present the shelter opens at am on weekdays and am on weekends, and closes at pm all week.However, trains can call at Dundee as early as .am and as late as .pm – meaning cyclists cannot securely park their bike in the facility.Maryfield councillor Lynne Short, who sits on regional transport board Tactran, said she has asked for the hours to be reviewed at a meeting with Abellio in March.The bike park was funded by Dundee City Council, Tactran and ScotRail, but is operated day-to-day by ScotRail and owned by Network Rail.Ms Short has contacted Tom Flanagan, partnership director at Tactran, to request the Dutch firm is made aware of the issue ahead of the meeting so it can have time to prepare a solution.She said: “It’s important as councillors we are aware of the problems evenit’s not always within our power to solve them but we know who to ask.”The facility was opened in November to great fanfare as a sign of the council’s ongoing commitment to sustainable transport."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/KCes_Stephanie_Kerr_Piano_Prodigy_Dundee_250119-1.jpg ","title":"gomis set to take over as dundee united target hat trick of wins down at queen of the south","story":"Veteran Morgaro Gomis is set to take over in midfield when Dundee United try to make it three wins on the bounce as they head for Queen of the South today.The -year-old is expected to replace Calum Butcher, who will serve the first game of a two-match ban after his red card in the Scottish Cup win at St Mirren last weekend.His second game on the sidelines will be the cup quarter-final against Ross County or Inverness Caley Thistle which has been confirmed for Sunday, March  at pm.The game is also being televised live on BBC Scotland.As well as continuing their recent winning run, the Tangerines will be looking for their third success of the campaign over Queens.To do that, though, manager Robbie Neilson is well aware they will have to keep in-form home striker Stephen Dobbie quiet.His spectacular strike in the cup at Aberdeen on Sunday was the -year-old’s th goal in just  appearances this term.“He has been on fire lately and someone we will have to get to grips with,” said Robbie.“He has a lot of quality, he knows how to score goals.“He’s just a very good player and I think he has the freedom of Dumfries these days.

They have some very good players,” he said.“The first thing we have to do is try to win our battles but don’t forget they have scored some quality goals, some good team goals.“We have to try to make sure inidually we get the better of them and try to go and create opportunities to win the game.”Dundee go into the clash with controversy over plastic pitches like Livi’s rekindled by a PFA survey showing top-flight players are unied in opposition to them.The manager is also in that camp but hasn’t forgotten that defeat at the Tony Macaroni in his first game in charge was down to what happened in the air and not the surface.That day back in October his team conceded four goals from set pieces.“We didn’t deal with set plays and that killed us. It was an eye-opener that day in terms of what we had to work with,” he said.“There’s no doubt, though, the surface is an advantage. I was the manager of a team, Queen of the South, who had an articial surface andyou train on it every day it’s a definite help.“At the same time I’m not trying to detract from how well Livingston have done because they’ve done exceptionally well.”Dundee are still nursing a few niggling injuries from that Killie draw, but it’s hoped everyone who was on duty then will be available.

Figures obtained by the Tele last year showed the council had cut street cleaning expenditure by % since .The annual budget – which covers work such as litter-picking, equipment maintenance and cleaning up graffiti and gum – has dropped from £. million to £.m in the last five years.The Tele took to the streets to ask a cross-section of people for their views.Catriona Simpson, , from the Hilltown, who works as a carer said: “I don’t think the streets are brilliant but around the city centre area is good. The gulls can make the litter worse and draw attention to it.“I think sometimes people don’t pay attention because they walk around in their own bubble and don’t notice.“I like to be positive though – the council services we have are good as far as I take an interest in them.”Locals agreed Dundee is becoming a safer city with % saying their neighbourhood was a safe place to live.Elliot Hepburn, , a customer service assistant from Menzieshill, said: “It’s a lot safer than it used to be.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"hscp welcomes community commitment ahead of crunch meeting","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Her conclusions drawn from experience was that when the monitors were around, there may have been unpleasant situations, but no tragedies. When there was no monitor around – clearly defined by their unorms – people died.Philippa had only been home for eight weeks when she spoke to the Justice and Peace Group, and she admitted that she was still processing the often brutal and violent scenes she had witnessed.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights. It’s a dficult one to take to get beat.They’re a big strong team and at times we didn’t cope with that.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsAyr United FC"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13999970.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS173884053.jpg","title":"centenary celebrations troons charles kerr","story":"S pupils Abbie Rankine left and Neve Gooding at the bust of the founder Charles Kerr Marr.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCharles Kerr Marr, retired coal contractor and formerly from Troon, boarded his train in London to Perthshire on Sunday January , , and little did he know his two week shooting and fishing break in Scotland would prove fatal for him, writes Nan McFarlane. His death revealed he had left his entire fortune in his will to his native town of Troon. His legacy would provide education awards and grants for the people of the town along with a new public school. As Marr’s train travelled north he decided to break his journey, to pay a visit to his sister in Girvan. He was close to his sister Helen and visited her often after her marriage to ColonelABGrant, owner of Killochan Castle estate at Girvan, who was also a senior partner in the firm of Grant Somerville  Co in London and was later ordained as Revd. Grant in the Church of Scotland. Marr had intended to spend part of his fortnight at Girvan but extended his stay to a month. Perhaps his change of heart was due to the widespread unrest taking place in Glasgow at that time. The January of  saw the so-called ‘Harbour Riots’, where racial confrontations were breaking out between black and white merchant seamen on the town’s quayside and spreading into the town. A four day General Strike was called for on January  and four days later George Square was crammed with tens of thousands of angry workmen. Crowds of unemployed men joined in the fracas for a  hour working week. As tempers flared the army was deployed, troops brought in tanks and armored vehicles to control the crowds. As tensions heightened it was not an environment travellers would want to find themselves caught up in. Eventually CK Marr left Girvan on Saturday February  for his onward journey north to his annual shooting and fishing break in Perthshire. As the train made its way towards the city he took ill with acute appendicitis. When taken off the train at the Central Station he was rushed to the Glasgow Nursing Home, but it was already too late as he tragically died in the operating theatre. There is little known of Charles Kerr Marr, despite having a successful career in the coal exporting business. Born on October , , at  Welbeck Crescent, Troon, he was the third son of Captain John Marr, master of the merchant ship ‘Reciprocity’, sailing between Troon and Canada. John Marr and his we Amelia had five children, sons William, John and Charles, along with two daughters, Helen and Amelia. Up to the age of ten, Charles attended the Parish School in Academy Street at Troon, going on to join his two brothers at Irvine Royal Academy to complete his education. On finishing his schooling, Marr was apprenticed at A  J Guthrie, Coal Agents at Troon Harbour. Unlike his brother John, who followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sea captain, Marr left home as soon as his apprenticeship ended, to work as a Commercial Clerk with Kitstons, Iron Merchants in Glasgow. Moving later to take up the position of cashier at Clyde Ironworks, only to leave a short time later to be manager of the firm of GrantSomerville  Co in London. The move may have been influenced by A B Grant, who was a senior partner in the company and married to his sister Helen. By the time he met his future we, some years later, there is no evidence as to when he moved back to Glasgow, or indeed any explanation found as to his change of occupation. Marr is recorded in the Scotland census of  as residing in Renfrew Street in Glasgow and again on his marriage certicate a year later, where he is also recorded as being employed as a Soft Goods Warehouseman.  Little is known as to why he left coal exporting to go into the Drapery business, or where he met and fell in love with his we Agnes Murray Kinghorn. However, Agnes’s father was a General Merchant, so it would seem likely he met her in his line of work. Charles and Agnes married on March ,  and set up home at Sutherland Terrace in Glasgow’s Hillhead. Unfortunately, after only  months of married le, Agnes tragically died of Phthisis Pulmonalis . She was just  years of age. Her death was a severe blow to Marr, leaving him brokenhearted and distraught, which had a profound effect on him. Shortly after he laid his we to rest, he had thought of going abroad to work, but instead accepted an appointment with Hull Blyth  Company of London. Within a year he was made a partner in the company when he developed the firm’s export trade. His work of establishing depots in numerous ports in the world gave him an opportunity to travel abroad, especially to China and Japan, where he found an interest in collecting oriental treasures. During his time with Hull Blyth the firm went on to become one of the largest shipping charterers in the UK. Charles Kerr Marr played a signicant part in the company’s worldwide success. Charles Marr moved to London after his we’s death, he never again owned a house. All his years in London, he alternated between two clubs, the Athenaeum and the Constitutional. The nearest he came to having a home was in his later years, when he rented two rooms in Camden House at Chislehurst in Kent, which was originally built for Napoleon the rd. Just being there helped him to relax and take up golf. He was reputed to be good company with a great sense of humour and well known to be very generous. Marr was a lover of the arts and music and in all that time he rarely spoke of his we, or of her death and he never remarried, even his closest friends assumed he was a bachelor. When he retired in  he spent a good part of each year fishing and shooting in Scotland. Two years before his untimely death, Charles Marr carefully drafted out his will in , leaving his entire fortune to the people of Troon and setting out the way it was to be carried out. Marr’s coal fortune legacy has given the town a magnicent architectural school building with playing fields the envy of the country. Marr College on its own is a fitting tribute to this man of extraordinary vision. By the time Marr College opened in  the school had attracted the most renowned academics to come and teach. It was the only grant aided school in Scotland that didn’t charge fees. A public school for every child of the town, had oak led class rooms, inlaid parquet flooring, Italian tiled corridorsa copper domed library, purple velvet drapes and teachers attired in flowing cloaks with mortar boards on their heads, this was seen by all to be a stunning,not magnicent, comprehensive school, deemed to be the best school in Scotland and envied by it. The CK Marr Educational Trust, the only one of its kind in Scotland, has provided awards or grants to hundreds of Troon students, of all ages each year. The addition of the MarrEducation Resource Centre in Troon Library, the only one then in Ayrshire, is a valuable educational resource for all who use it. Marr College and the CK Marr Educational Trust are a testimony to the wishes of Charles Kerr Marr and a fitting memorial to this great benefactor. He was buried beside his beloved we in CathcartCemetery in Glasgow. Over the past century the people of Troon owe a huge debt to custodians of Marr’s vision, the Marr Trustees, past and present. Over the decades the many Trustees, Boards of Governors and ious Clerks, Treasurers and Accountants, who have and still do today and for many decades to come, have successfully upheld the wishes of the town’s greatest ever benefactor and extraordinary visionary, Charles Kerr Marr.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandUniversities and CollegesGlasgowEducationFishingArmed forcesLove and romanceSchoolsRenfrewTroonPerthshireGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema set return prestwick after","story":"NewsCinema set forto Prestwick after  year gapReturn to the golden age of screen in PrestwickShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB NewsFriends of Broadway - they want cinema open again \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCinema made a boldto Prestwick for the first time in more than  years.

A number of venues in the Auchinleck area applied to open their bars for a tipple at am on match day as Talbot geared up to face Ayr. Licensing bosses at East Ayrshire Council knocked back the flurry of applications for early morning drinking before the January  showdown. Despite the historic nature of the sporting event, the department decided to maintain their stance on trying to clamp down on excess boozing during football. The East Ayrshire Licensing board depute clerk Stuart McCall told councillors it was important to maintain the standard policy and have consistency. He pointed to Celtic and Rangers matches as examples of tense clashes requiring robust licensing rules. Mr McCall said: “The standard practice is games start early and the reason for that is to limit the amount of alcohol supporters can have.” “We all know the outcome excess alcohol can have in certain circumstances.” Congragulating Talbot, he added: “We are all delighted to see the result. “The maintenance of the policy is important so we are not accused of favouritism.” Some venues wanted to offer breakfast to supporters. Auchinleck Talbot defeated Ayr by one goal to nil. Alcohol was not permitted inside the grounds and fans were told they would be refused entryintoxicated.

John Senior has been an animal surgeon in the town for  years. He has also immersed himself in activities and volunteering for all sorts of causes. This week he was continuing his latest community activity as a hand bell ringer at Cumnock Old Church. John, , said: “All I want is the best for Cumnock and we are so fortunte to have so many things going on now. “I just want to make it better than it is.” The Keir McTurk Memorial Committee chose John after “much deliberation” from all the nominations. Chairman Colin Chisholm said: “John is someone who prefers to work behind the scenes rather than be at the forefront. “But his efforts for the community have proved invaluable.” John, originally from Edinburgh, has freshly retired from the Crossriggs veterinary practice in the town. When he arrived in  it was chiefly large livestock but treats mostly small animals. His we Heather, also a vet, remains involved in the management and their son Iain, the third member of the Senior family who is a vet, runs the practice. John is a very active member of the Cumnock Action Plan Committee, in which he has reformed the Cumnock Gardening Club assisted living in the arrangements for the Christmas festival and was actively involved in the poppy display marking the centenary of the end of the First World War. He is also an elder in the Trinity Church and a member of the fabric committee. John is an active member of Cumnock Business Association, a board member of the credit union and of Glaisnock Trust and Cumnock Tryst. Assistance he gives to both the Highland games committee and Camps is described as “invaluable.” But he said: “I don’t like standing on a pedestal. I prefer being in the background. “I somehow manage to find time for the things I want to do and I am not very good at sitting down doing nothing. “I enjoy being active and putting things back into a town that has supported me and given me a living for  years.” The presentation is likely to be at Dumfries House.

Cycling Without Age Prestwick is transforming lives of those with limited mobility in the area with their specially designed trishaw, a light three -wheeled vehcile with pedal used in Asian countries . The three-wheeled rickshaw is a little more than a ‘sofa on wheels’ as it is engineered to accommodate two passengers in the front and driven by a pilot in the rear. Those with mobility restrictions - old and young- can take a trip to the seafront, enjoy the Prestwick promenade views and have a good old natter. Now the community project, who’s base has been kindly gted by St Ninian’s Episcopal Church, are eager to find more volunteer pilots and those keen to get out on the trishaw. Chris Cheales, of Cycling Without Age Prestwick, said: “We now have two trishaws and we are in the middle of a training programme to help - people become qualied before starting the operation in spring. We offer two-hour sessions to two passengers and there is the opportunity to go for a drink, stop to chat, pet a dog or just enjoy the views. “We are looking for people with limited mobility who may or may not also struggle with loneliness and isolation and who would benefit from the freedom of feeling ‘the wind in their hair’. “Time is a wonderful gt to give anyone. The group hope to expand as the project grows and take their trishaws on tour to visit care homes in the area. Chris added: “We envisage days allocated to ‘user groups’, to include care homes, those recommended by Dementia Friendly Prestwick, retirement housing and local churches. “Trishaws are not cheap so we need ongoing help to keep all this on the road. “We are looking forward to another sunny summer and sharing the project with others.” The Prestwick Peoples Project has also benefitted those involved, helping volunteers flourish and gain confidence. Zara Crumlish has been a Young Ambassador for Cycling Without Age for six months. Zara, , said: “I’ve always wanted to ride a bike when I was younger but I didn’t have the balance. “The trishaw has helped me get my confidence up. “It gets me out and about with the community. “And I’m excited because I really can’t wait to take elderly people out and show them the Prom.” •Would you like to be trained as a Trishaw Pilot  Or a willing volunteer to be a co-pilot to accompany trips  .

This has not been taken lightly and we deeply regret how unsettling todayrsquos announcement will be for our people.HUM director Jason Smith said: ldquoWe understand the impact this proposal will have on our associates, wider supplier base and the local community.

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers saddled up for funds","story":"Last Saturday, in the Co-op foyer, players took half hour shts, on two bikes, to raise more than £, towards funds to compete in the three-day Edinburgh International Youth Cup in August.A Campbeltown and District Juvenile Football Association spokesperson said: #A massive thank you to Campbeltown Co-op for allowing us to use their foyer to spin our way to a massive £,..#Thank you to each and everyone of you who supported us and also the words of encouragement, which meant a lot.#CDJFA, supported by quiz queen Helen Gilchrist, will hold a Big Quiz Night, at Stronvaar Bowling Club on Saturday March  with a £ top prize.The evening#s entertainment will include a quiz, raffles and television show games.The young spinners from left are: Josh MacDonald, , John McTaggart, , Jack MacNab,  and Daniel McEachran,._cfootballfunds_CDJFA"},{"url":null,"title":"andrew mccornick re elected president of nfu scotland","story":"Having already led the union for two years, Dumfriesshire farmer Mr McCornick will now hold office for a further two years by which time he will have served the maximum allowed under the constitution of a pair of two-year terms.After a keenly fought election, the vote for the two vice presidential posts saw Perthshire farmer Martin Kennedy re-elected to serve alongside Charlie Adam from Aberdeenshire, currently Livestock Committee chairman.The unsuccessful vice presidential candidate was Ian Sands from Perthshire, who is chair of the NFUS#s Combinable Crops committee.Under the terms of the constitution, Mr Kennedy, as a serving vice president, will be seeking re-election next year, having already served as vice president for two years.Mr Adam, being elected to the position of vice president for the first time, will initially serve for two years before the post reverts to an annual election.After the election Mr McCornick said: #There are dficult and challenging times ahead but Martin, Charlie and I have been given a clear mandate by members to represent them and we are honoured to carry their message forward.#Throughout the protracted and frustrating Brexit process, NFUS has been crystal clear about its priorities and through our ‘Steps to Change’ work we have mapped out our thoughts on a new agricultural policy for Scotland.#I believe we have a top table team, which, backed by the members, staff and secretaries, has the vision to deliver on that.#Those who choose to seek office and represent fellow members in any capacity undertake a huge commitment and although missing out, I congratulate Ian for the part he played in a hard-fought campaign and the outstanding work he does in representing his sector.#NFUS president Andrew McCornick.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

The way in which he has approached Brexit, meanwhile ndash suggesting truculently to the Irish foreign minister recently that Ireland should leave the EU and ldquothrow in their lot with the UK was a particular low point ndash has led many people, me included, to switch off.Irsquom not saying for a minute BBC journalists shouldnrsquot be robust in their questioning, and there are plenty, both male and female ndash Kirsty Wark, Gary Robertson, Emily Maitlisand Nick Robinson spring to mind ndash who can incisively demolish the arguments of those in power.But punching down and wearing prejudices on your sleeve is not only editorially questionable, leaving the Beeb open to accusations of bias, but also astonishingly arrogant.And here we come to the crux of the matter: Neil and Humphrys have had their day. They have worn their arrogance and male privilege as a badge of honour for too long, lacking the humility or self-awareness to examine their own behaviour. Put them out to pastureso they can moan away till their hearts content, perhaps even to each other, about how hard done by they are, how it wasnrsquot like this in the old days.As research highlights, the BBC is losing younger viewers and listeners in their droves. Andrew Neil and John Humphrys are part of the problem - and the Beeb is better off without them."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9444117.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ian-murray-says-party-split-is-sad-day-for-labour","story":"The Edinburgh MP, who was not among a group of seven MPs who resigned the whip to form breakawayThe Independence Group, called on the Labour leader to \"decidehe wants to lead a party for the many or continue to restrict it to a party of the few\".Former shadow cabinet ministers Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie quit, alongsideAnn Coffey, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Luciana Berger and Gavin Shuker.Read more:Who are The Independence Group  Former Labour MPs form breakaway partyMr Murray said: ldquoIt is a sad day for the Labour Party and for me personally.

The Capital team gave away spot prizes and there was live music from talented musicians Tommy McGuire and Ben Monteith to help celebrate the launch.And there is much more to come as First Glasgow have four more routes to rollout over the coming months as they continue their improvement of local services across the city and surrounding areas.Councillor Anna Richardson was on hand to help launch the second phase of new vehicle rollouts for First Glasgow and she reiterated her commitment to working in partnership to deliver the very best local transport that the city deserves.Cllr Anna Richardson, Convener for Sustainability and Carbon Reduction at Glasgow City Council said: ldquoThrough partnership working, wersquove taken great strides to improve Glasgowrsquos air quality, knowing it can be a signicant factor in local health inequalities, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable in our society.Cllr Anna Richardson, Convener for Sustainability and Carbon Reduction at Glasgow City Council ldquoOur pioneering Low Emission Zone - the first ever in Scotland, will improve air quality and deliver better health outcomes for the people of Glasgow as well as improving the amenity of our city centre, making it a safer and cleaner place to be.ldquoItrsquos heartening to know that these brand-new vehicles, which meet the strict emission standards required by Glasgowrsquos LEZ, will soon be operating in our city centre and beyond.ldquoWe worked closely with the bus operators to bring in the LEZ last year as planned and wersquoll continue to work in partnership to improve services that are vital to the lives of Glaswegians.ldquoGlasgowrsquos LEZ only affects local service buses at present but by the end of , its emission standards will apply to all vehicles entering the zone. This phased approach looks at the cityrsquos overall needs and gives iniduals and businesses time to prepare.Graeme Macfarlan, Commercial Director for First Glasgow, adds: ldquoWe are committed to working with Glasgow City Council, Transport Scotland and the Cabinet Minister to improve the cityrsquos bus services. The bus is very much part of the solution when it comes to reducing emissions on our already congested roads as one full low emission bus can take up to  cars off the road.the brand new ultra-low emission service  vehicles ldquoBy deploying our new Euro VI technology vehicles that offer more comfort and are eco-friendlier we are headed in the right direction, but I know that a lot more can be achieved with strong working partnerships as we look to make public transport a more attractive alternative to the car for more people.ldquoThese new vehicles not only represent a signicant investment in new fleet, but they represent a vast improvement in on-board standards with more comfortable seating, free WIFI and USB charging points aimed at giving customers a better experience. There really has never been a better time to try the bus.ldquoIn addition to the  new Glasgow vehicles introduced since October , First Bus in Scotland continue to explore new fuel technologies and will be working with Scottish Power Energy Networks to introduce two electric vehicles to the city of Glasgow, as well as continuing to work with Aberdeen City Council on the next phase of Hydrogen bus deployment in Aberdeen.The Heraldrsquos Climate for Change initiative supports efforts being made by the ScottishGovernmentwith key organisations and campaign partners.

manufacturing, and has a disproportionate impact on many of our business communities and on our export strength.\"The planned closure of the Swindon plant will have a major impact across the area, affecting not only many employees on site but also firms and staff across the supply chain.\"Given the size of the operation, there will be a wide and erse network of regional suppliers that will now be hugely concerned about their future business prospects.\"Employers, government and local authorities must do all they can to deliver tangible assistance and guidance for the people and communities that will be affected by an announcement of this scale.\"This development highlights the importance of maintaining and attracting investment in local economies.\"While the automotive industry, in general, is going through a period of transition, and a number of global factors will have played a major part in a decision of this size, the ongoing Brexit uncertainty and looming threat of no deal

Connelly has worked in traffic control since  so theres not much he hasnt seen. The Beast from the East brought the worst weather conditions hes encountered during his many years of service. The team is both proactive and reactive in its mission to keep Scotland’s roads moving – planning for issues it can see coming and responding quickly to those that it can’t.Partnerships play an essential role in the day-to-day operations here.For example, we’re sitting in the resilience room where Transport Scotland, the Scottish Government agency which oversees our transport industry, meets during major crises, such as the Beast from the East.It is here, too, where action plans are drawn up to cope with major events on the annual calendar or roadworks on vital routes.A Police Scotland officer is based in the centre at peak times, along with Traffic Scotland’s media officers who Tweet updates throughout the day and INRIX, a radio team which transmits travel updates, both on the website and to most of our radio stations.From September to April, a MET office employee is also based in the centre.But Traffic Scotland has many more partners behind the scenes too.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"It looks likely that the council will raise the areas Council Tax rates by three per cent\"  Counterfeit cash alert after incidents reported in Fe viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Stein explained: “We work closely with event organisers to ensure people get to the Open or Royal Highland Show with as little disruption as possible, particularly when two major events are on at the same time.“We also work with the road operating companies, Freight Haulage Association and public transport providers, such as Abellio Scotrail. We co-ordinate road and rail works to minimise the impact for commuters and the Scottish economy.”With all of the country’s roadside SOS calls also being answered at the centre, there are few down times.It’s a round-the-clock job and often a tough one, with operators witnessing incidents that take a toll.Even Stein, despite his many years in the job, isn’t immune.He explained: “Operators can take a call from someone saying they’re going to jump off the Erskine Bridge, pan the camera round and see them jumping. That can really stay with someone.“One that sticks in my mind was an accident at Charing Cross in Glasgow.“The car was a mess and as we panned the camera round we saw a child’s car seat, empty, on the road.“The room fell quiet but nothing was said. Later on, the police told us there were no fatalities and no children had been hurt – the sense of relief here was amazing.”Staff have access to counselling, should they need it as a result of anything they’ve witnessed.But you get the sense of a camaraderie among the team too which undoubtedly helps get them through the tough days.Last February and March, the Beast from the East proved a real challenge – some operators didn’t make it home for days, while others couldn’t make it in.Stein was at the helm through it all, steering the ship through the worst road conditions witnessed in Scotland in a generation.He said: “It was pretty bad in  but the Beast from the East is the worst weather I’ve ever experienced.“Usually, we can marshall maintenance teams and gritters from one part of the country to help in other areas hit by severe weather. That just wasn’t possible. “I was camped out here for five days, as was Humza Yousaf, the then transport minister. The operators couldn’t get home either so they just got on with the job, like they always do.“It was the first red weather warning in Scotland – everyone learned from it.”A Hilltip Icestriker from Finland is now being trialled on the M to ensure recovery teams can access incidents and an electric powered spreader has been deployed on the M.As for daily operations, the public also has an important role to play.“We have just over  CCTV cameras on km of roads,” said Stein. “It’s not a lot to cover such a large area.“So the public are often our eyes and ears, alerting us to breakdowns so we can send out a recovery team.“We get a lot of thank you letters as a result.”Those worried about big brother watching need not fear either.Stein added: “We don’t record number plates or incidents, unless the police ask us to.“So while we get a lot of requests, we can’t help solicitors looking for accident recordings – we don’t have them.”Crossing over the Forth is now far more reliableTraffic Scotland’s National Control Centre was opened on April , , by then depute first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Also used as a contact and education centre for pupils to find out more about the £. billion Queensferry Crossing, thousands of children visited to get a bird’s eye view as the project unfolded. At . miles , it is the longest bridge of its type in the world and also the tallest, towering mhigh. But has it eased congestion for those travelling along the east coast artery between Fe and Edinburgh According to Traffic Scotland statistics, the crossing is very much doing the job it was intended for.Since September , there have been  occasions when the Forth Road Bridge would have been closed to high-sided vehicles due to high winds.Wind shielding on the new crossing enabled it to remain open, affording far more reliability for commuters and hauliers who regularly use it.The hard shoulder on the new bridge also means there are no longer lane closuresvehicles breakdown along its span.Stein said: “The crossing’s improved reliability is delivering benefits not only for commuters but for businesses and the wider Scottish economy too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"crossing borders with your dog after brexit","story":"A.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past.

This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect.

Those wrecks are still the primary focus of recreational ers, but the remains of the vessels that were mostly recovered and removed from Scapa Flow have also been a recognised ing resource for many years.However, the exact extent and composition of these so-called salvage sites was unknown until this week, when the report of the second phase of work on these sites was published online.The overall aim of the Scapa Flow Salvage Sites Project was to determine what remains of the many vessels of the German High Seas Fleet that were salvaged in the years that followed their scuttling in June .Phase One, undertaken over the winter of  , involved a side scan sonar survey of the main anchorages and other areas thought to have been involved in the salvage process.In the second phase of this project, ers and remotely operated vehicles examined and recorded the remains in detail.The overall result is that the vast majority of salvage sites in Scapa Flow have been located and the remains at each site have been directly investigated and recorded.The full report is now available for public download through the Scapa Flow Historic Wreck website http:www.scapaflowwrecks projects salvage-sites-phase- Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime. This offers a unique perspective that can show just what preventative measures can be taken to outsmart these online criminals.”To learn more about the Cyber Sense on Tour event and to book a free place, visit www.hellodigital.scot cyber-sense- copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was a beautul thing and I cherished it for years. But I remember one of the strange things about that Christmas was going back to school.It must have been primary  or , and we had a group discussion in class about what Santa had brought us all.At the time, I wondered why so many of my classmates had asked for what I innocently termed “boring” things, like a new coat.Years later however, when Christmas began to bite into my own budget, I realised that my child’s vision of the world had not seen the real signicance of the gts.I do not come from a particularly well-off background.For the first decade and a half of my le we lived in a house rented from the housing association.We didn’t have a lot but I had both a new coat and a bike that year.I’m not sure but I think that memory had a lot to do with my recent determination to be my party’s spokesperson on the Department of Work and Pensions .Oh some witty person – probably one of my sisters – will say it’s more to do with me getting closer to my pension.But as any WASPI woman will tell you, that’s not as close as it used to be, which is an argument for another day.No. Every week constituents come to me who have been given what can best be termed as “the run around” by some section of the DWP.: Amber Rudd: Families on universal credit did have to use food banksIt could be pensions, it could be Universal Credit or it could be the system of Personal Independence Payments for those with a disability which, as assessment systems go, is not fit for purpose.In every one of them, I see someone who deserves to be treated better.In each case I’m reminded that in this, the fth richest nation on earth, there are still people for whom le is a daily economic challenge.And what we often overlook is that the majority of those who find themselves facing an uphill financial struggle are already working for a living – the ‘just about managing’ to whom Theresa May promised so much in her first speech as Prime Minister.In a meeting this week with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, I was stunned to hear that of the already unacceptable number of children living in poverty in this country, two-thirds are from working households.How are we getting it so wrong in this country I have written in this newspaper before about my frustrations at the problem in our country’s welfare system, of which we were once so proud.I have criticised the management of the changes in state pension age for women.And I have railed at the issues with the well-intentioned but fatally underfunded Universal Credit.Only this week the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Amber Rudd, admitted that its failings have been responsible for sending so many people to food banks.But the crux of my gripe is that I realise that we have slipped very far from the fair society, backed by a strong economy, we aim to be.: Rudd urged to ditch DWP policies after damning UN reportOne half of that, the former, we have managed to achieve. The other still seems to be tantalisingly out of our reach. And it needn’t be.I am not in Government. ButI were, the first thing I would do in my new post would be to act on that recognition which Amber Rudd is the first in the Cabinet to publicly acknowledge.I would put back the £ billion which George Osborne took out of the budget for Universal Credit.Then I would pause the roll-out and migration from legacy benefits and fix the obvious problems that are leaving families with nothing to live on for more than a month, causing people to fall into rent arrears and adding stress to an already intolerable burden.After that, I would address the issues which still allow situations where the benefits of getting a job are undermined.But, more than anything , I would want to do something about those children in poverty.I thought about them this week and I thought about that Christmas when I was no more than eight or nine years old.At that time, le was simple for me.I had a big loving family and any financial challenges my parents might have faced were well hidden from us.For my younger sisters, it was slightly dferent.When my dad died at the age of , we went overnight from being relatively well off and living in a home we owned to a single-parent family with no income. My mum went back out to work and somehow managed to give my sisters everything I had known.But, at the age of , I realised how easy it is to fall through the cracks.Then, like now, I thought about those kids in my class that Christmas.Most of them had at least as much potential as I did, but not all of them got to fulfill it.Today that thought as much as,not more than, any political principle I have is what drives my daily le. I have been lucky. I have been able to give my daughter the start in le my parents were able to give me.Maybe because of that I want every child to have the opportunity to fulfill their potential, and feel it’s up to those of us who have to make sure it happens.No family should have to choose between Christmas presents and keeping warm.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon eu nationals crucial to scotland s well being","story":"Nicola Sturgeon will say EU nationals at #crucial# to Scotland#s well-being as she appears before delegates in the French Parliament today.Scotland’s First Minister will appear before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Assemblée Nationale, the lower house of the French legislature in Paris.The SNP leader will attack theUK’s decision to end Freedom of Movement as part of its Brexit deal as a ‘self-defeating measure’ and pledge to give her support to EU citizens currently living in Scotland. - Scottish students warned off taking music as a subject to save schools money“Those EU citizens of course include , French people, who are our colleagues, friends, neighbours and in many cases our family.

MPs Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie, Gavin Shuker, Mike Gapes, Angela Smith, Ann Coffey and Chuka Umunna wrote to party officials informing them of their resignation moments before holding a press conference to reveal their plans.They appealed to others angry at the deadlock over Brexit and the looming risk of a no-deal exit from the EU to quit their parties and join a new “Independent Group” in the centre ground.Mr Corbyn said he was “disappointed” by the announcement. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell challenged the seven to resign from Parliament and fight by-elections under their new independent banner.But in a stark message from Mr Corbyn’s deputy, Tom Watson said he “feared this day would come” and warned that “unless we change, we may see more days like this”.Mr Watson criticised the handling of antisemitism allegations and said Ms Berger had fallen victim to “a virulent form of identity politics that has seized the Labour Party”.He called for an immediate reshuffle of the frontbench team to reflect dfering opinions in the parliamentary Labour Party.Struggling to contain their emotion, the seven MPs condemned the direction of their former party since Mr Corbyn took office. Ms Berger, who has faced death threats over her criticism of the Labour leadership, said she had become “embarrassed and ashamed” of representing a party she claimed was “institutionally antisemitic”.Mr Leslie said Labour had been “hijacked by the machine politics of the hard left” and claimed Mr Corbyn’s hostility to business and Nato flowed from a “narrow, outdated ideology”.Mr Umunna encouraged members of all parties angry at the conduct of politics to support their group. Established parties “can’t provide the change because they have become the problem”, Mr Umunna said. He added: “If you are sick and tired of politics as usual, guess what  So are we.“If you want an alternative, please help us build it. The bottom line is this – politics is broken. It doesn’t have to be this way.

Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said the party had to “look long and hard at the reasons why the MPs feel they are no longer able to stay”.But Unite general secretary Len McCluskey – one of the key powers behind Mr Corbyn’s leadership – accused the breakaway MPs of “hypocrisy” for standing for election on a Labour manesto.“All of them got massive increases in their majorities,” he said. “It wasn’t because of their own personal charisma. It was because of the manesto, which promised to respect the  referendum.”Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said he was “open to working with like-minded groups and iniduals” to bring about a second EU referendum and would seek talks with the members of the Independent Group.The SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the split in Labour showed Westminster was “now completely dysal”.He said: “Labour are not fit for purpose – they are failing as an opposition, failing over Brexit and failing their own MPs.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish primary pupil wins settlement after he was crushed by a wall","story":"A primary school pupil who was crushed by a wall leaving him with a broken leg that is now a centimetre longer than the other has won an out-of-court settlement.Max MacPhee was five years old when a wall he was leaning on collapsed in the playground at Ben Wyvis Primary School in Conon Bridge, near Dingwall, in the Highlands.He had been leaning on the wall after his morning nursery session when a coping stone detached and struck him on the right leg, breaking it just beneath the knee.Max spent two months recovering, most of which was spent using a wheelchair or a walking frame. His bed was placed in the living room as he could not walk up the stairs.For the first few weeks of his recovery the youngster also had to be bathed by hand while lying on top of a kitchen worktop because he could not get into a bath.Max, now aged seven, has been left with one leg cm shorter than the other and his family sued Highland Council, which initially denied liability.Investigations by law firm Digby Brown found the local authority was alerted to structure concerns at Ben Wyvis Primary when a coping stone fell from the same wall in  - a year before Max was injured. Despite this, the council still failed to carry out adequate inspections or repair work.Max’s mother Louise MacPhee, , said the Highland Council “tried to blame” her son.She said: “It’s shocking that Highland Council didn’t have the common decency to hold their hands up and just help a little boy who was hurt by their own failings instead of having the audacity to try and blame him. The council put us through hell, not to mention wasted public money on legal bills, when they could just have done the right thing from day one. At least now they can be held accountable and everyone will know their shameful tactics in blaming a little boy.”Highland Council denied liability throughout a civil action but last week backtracked by offering an out-of-court settlement.David McGowan, who helped to secure the settlement, said: “This was clearly an accident waiting to happen and it’s distressing to consider how much worse Max or anyone  could have been injured.“Every local authority has a duty of care towards those entering their premises.”The sum of the settlement has not been disclosed.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WINTER-19-TRACTOR-1.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year. Her performances have also caught the eye of the Celtic women#s team and she was recently invited to join the club#s national performance squad for a year#s trial. last week. #I can fly down and be in Glasgow on a Friday and fly back to be in school on Monday morning. It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DUNVEGAN-CASTLE-SNOWDROPS-3.jpg","title":"nae pasaranwhen scottish workers stood against a fascist","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere can#t be many pensioners from East Kilbride who are Commanders of the Republic of Chile. It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

When we go back and look at the stats, those are the things we will be saying.#It was a slow start to this game with both teams hitting early wides, but the pattern was soon established with James McNaughton and Alan Devine trading frees before Aonghus Clarke fired over from range.Three McNaughton frees gave Antrim the edge as he then traded points with Devine before Nigel Elliott finally shot Antrim#s first from play on  minutes to make it - to -, but this was to be their final score of the opening half.Westmeath drew level thanks to a Devine free and a magnicent sideline cut from Derek McNicholas before Devine gave them the lead.It was to get even better for the visitors on  minutes as Devine got a touch to Robbie Greville#s long delivery to find the net, while McNicholas and Devine added points to make it - to - at the break.With the swirling wind at their backs in the second period, Antrim needed a bright start and they got it with McNaughton clipping over a free and then Nigel Elliott sent Keelan Molloy in to flick to the net.McNaughton and Kevin Rice added points but, crucially, Antrim could never get ahead.The visitors rallied with the next three points and this was a lead they were to hold for the majority of the second period as the teams effectively went score-for-score.Antrim did get to within one with Conor McCann – who had what looked like a good shout for a penalty waved away when hauled back by Tommy Doyle late on – and McNaughton hitting scores. But McNicholas – who earlier clipped over another sideline – landed a monster free.McNaughton had a free that was finally given as a wide deep into added time when it appeared over, but the goal Antrim needed wouldn#t come as Westmeath held on for a crucial win.ANTRIM: R Elliott S Rooney, J Dillon, P Duffin M Donnelly, S McCrory, C McHugh C McCann , N McKeague N Elliott , J McNaughton , K RiceE O#Neill, K Molloy , C Clarke.

After giving the matter some thought, Squinter has been unable to separate two candidates, and so the prize is jointly awarded. First co-winner is Andrea Leadsom, Tory Leader of the House, for her reaction to Donald Tusk’s statement that there’s “a special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit “without a sketch of a plan”.Andrea’s response was rather more temperate than that of Sammy Wilson, who opined that Mr Tusk was a “devilish, trident wielding, euro maniac”. She remarked, with what would appear at first blush to be commendable restraint: “The man has no manners.”But on hearing Andrea’s mention of the word “manners”, a little bell went off somewhere deep in Squinter’s hippocampus and after a short period of beard-scratching and pencils-sucking, it came to Squinter why the Honourable Member is on rather thin ice when it comes to matters of polite conduct.Come back in time with Squinter to the summer of , just two weeks before Britain voted to leave the EU. Andrea was locked in a battle with Theresa May for leadership of the Conservative Party. In an interview with The Times, when asked why the party should opt for her, she replied that her rival “possibly has nieces, nephews, lots of people. But I have children who are going to have children who will directly be part of what happens next.”So there we have it. Andrea pitched for the top job by saying having children gives her more of a stake in the country. At which point, we should remind ourselves that Theresa May has spoken honestly and movingly about the fact that she and her husband Philip were unable to have children.Manners  Yih pays yer money…Joint winner is British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling who announced on Friday that he was cancelling the £ million contract he had awarded to Seaborne Freight just before Christmas to provide a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend to ease the pressure on the port of Dover should the UK crash out with no deal.Mr Grayling’s tenure has been one of the great comedy shows of British politics and it’s widely believed that he remains in office only to direct fire away from more senior colleagues. Not that he could have seen this mess developing. After all, Seaborne Freight was a highly respected company with a long history of professional and responsible conduct in the business of ferries and freight, right  Well, since the company only hit the news in December you probably don’t need Squinter to remind you that Seaborne Freight:• Was a completely new company• Didn’t own a ship• Cut and pasted its website terms and conditions from a pizza delivery firmand an online boutiqueThe high-flying cabinet minister sent out to back Grayling when the contract was scrubbed was Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. You know, the bloke was Secretary of State here for a while and nobody noticed.Chris’ll be gone by the end of the week, then.Fail to prepare#LET’S be honest, Jim Wells isn’t flavour of the month within the DUP. The South Down MLA had the party whip withdrawn last spring after he fell out with the top brass over his claim that they had reneged on a promise to reinstate him as Health Minister after he stepped down in  over an election hustings row.Jimbo claimed then party leader party leader Peter Robinson promised to reinstate him when andthe furious furoreblew over . He further alleged that when Arlene Foster took over as leader she ignored two written requests from him to honour Peter’s pledge. These days Jimbo’s something of a voice in the wilderness, technically still a DUP MLA but shorn of any authority to speak for the party. Which makes him of considerable interest to journalists, since the resentment he clearly still feels makes him a little bit more willing to open up about things than other DUP reps.Jim’s been at it again this week and, given the state we’re in at the moment, you’ll probably not be surprised to hear that it’s Brexit-related. Jim revealed that at the extraordinary meeting at which the party decided to back Leave in the months leading up to the EU referendum in , there was zero discussion of what a Leave vote would mean for the local economy. This would be an awkward revelation for most parties, but after the tsunami of controversies that the DUP has been through in the past couple of years, it seems to have reached the point that its brand is so polluted the tin can’t get any more dented, the label any dirtier. But that’s not the disaster that it would certainly be for any other party because the DUP’s substantial vote clearly consists of people who don’t care what they get up to as long as they’re not Sinn Féin.Lack of planning – it’ll do for ye every time. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, that’s the old saying and nowhere does it ring more true than in the crazy world of Brexit. Let’s take a look at a few of the most notorious failures of a lack of foresight and seewe can work out where the DUP Brexit calamity fits in…Betamax’Member when video cassettes were the most exciting innovation in the history of technology  You don’t  Well, you must be under , so let’s seewe can explain. Two Japanese giants of the global electronics industry were caught up in the race to win control of the massive new market. JVC produced the eventually successful VHS format, while Sony produced the toploading Betamax system. Although the Betamax system was of a superior picture quality, it was considerably more expensive and had a shorter recording time. At a meeting in , Sony were advised by Matsushita engineers to switch to the VHS format, but declined. It wa a historic mistake, dealing the company a crippling financial blow from which it would take years to recover.Ford EdselFord were inordinately pleased with the Edsel, a new model released in the United States in , the year after the Ford family relinquished control of the company. The Edselwas designed to give Ford the upper-hand in the highly competitive premium intermediate market . The company missed the design boat, though, as the car harked back to an earlier age at a time when families were increasingly turning to compact vehicles. The Edsel was discontinued two years later, with sales signicantly less than half the break-even sales figure. Executives took their eye off the ball and didn’t realise the Edsel was flopping until over .bnhad been spent on design, manufacture and new dealerships. To this day, new models that fail are still referred to in the US automobile market as ‘Edsels’.New CokeIn the mid-s, as other soft drinks were increasingly threatening the dominance of Coca-Cola, the company decided it was going to ditch the original Coke formula and go with an improved ‘New Coke’.The  launch was a disaster and sales were badly hit, particularly in the southern states where Coca-Cola was considered an integral part of American culture. Tens of thousands of complaints flooded into company HQ weekly. The problem was not so much with the taste – the company had disastrously underestimated the hold that the Coca-Cola brand had on the American psyche. Smelling blood, rivals Pepsi began a new ad campaign with the strapline ‘Now I Know Why Coke Did It’ . Fans started booing ads for New Coke at large sports events. Just  days after New Coke was launched, the company announced that it was bringing back the old formula.Has to be a Brexit message in there somewhere, no "},{"url":null,"title":"belfast schools funding review after exam results excluded from statistics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Fair Head would be popular with climbers so I have seen the professionals and this was not it,\" he continued.\"Its madness. Had they fallen its the Atlantic Ocean. They wouldnt last long and theyd likely hit a rock on the way down.\"Theres been a lot of snow and rain over the past week and the grass is just sitting there so you put weight on it and its away from under you.\"Its a dangerous spot as its dficult for the leboat to get to so most likely they would have to wait on the Coastguard helicopter and that can be a  minute wait. And then those resources are tied upsomeone  gets into dficulty.He added: \"We all make mistakes - but this is just madness and so irresponsible. They clearly dont think anything of themselves or those that would put their lives at risk in trying to save them.\"Causeway Coast and Glens UUP Councillor Joan Baird, who lives close to the location, said she was shocked and called on those to desist.\"Just consider those that would, without thought, risk their lives to come out to rescue youyou get into dficulty,\" she said.\"I am not against climbing so long as they wear the right safety gear and are trained. But this does not look to be the case.\"Over the summer there would nearly be daily call outs. I was out walking today and there were paths that I felt were not safe to walk on given the amount of slippage we have had after the snow last week. The surfaces are in poor condition and very dficult.\"I would call for those doing this to stop.\"Ryan Gray Senior Maritime Operations Officer for HM Coastguard added: \"The recent photos taken at Ballycastle are concerning, we want people to enjoy themselves at the coast by making sure their visit is one to remember and not one they’d rather forget.\"We strongly recommend you do not attempt to climb up or down clfs unless you are properly equipped and trained to do so, and don’t attempt to climb clfs as a short cut. If unequipped for a climb it only takes one slip or a loose rock for it to end in tragedy. Remember,you think someone might be in trouble along the coast or out at sea please call  and ask for the Coastguard.\""},{"url":null,"title":"saved from the chinese meat trade dogs given homes in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The remainder were transported to rescue centres across the UK for rehoming.Group leader Davidhas a Facebook page Play for Strays, created to donate toys and boredom relief to rescue animals all over the world.Last year he transported an abused dog , miles from the Amazon after finding it on a remote uninhabited island.When Caolan , who runs Pets Lost and Found Fermanagh on social media, shared Davids story on his own Facebook page, the two struck up a friendship. David invited Caolan to join him on his mission to China, where it is estimated  million dogs are slaughtered annually for the meat trade.The Enniskillen man described the trip as \"the biggest and most spontaneous adventure\" of his le. He said many of the rescued animals are living in squalor and suffer from a range of disabilities.He added: \"Working alongside such amazing people was absolutely humbling. \"The dedication they put into not only rehabilitating so many dferent dogs, and the sacrices they make along the way, was the most eye-opening and heart-warming thing Ive ever seen and will remain with me forever.\"David had originally rescued Scoop on a visit to China last August, and brought him and Sebastian back to their new owner in Co Armagh.He said: \"When I first saw Scoop he had no hair but now it has grown back and hes like a little teddy bear. \"I literally scooped him off the floor when we saved some puppies after their mums were killed.\"Sebastian had canine distemper virus when he was found on the back of a meat truck bound for the infamous Yulin Dog Meat Festival. This condition usually kills dogs outright and gives them very severe tremors. \"Luckily he has recovered very well and is living a full le now with only very slight tremors.\"It is estimated that up to , dogs are eaten at the annual -day festival in Yulin, which has been slammed by animal rights organisations.Sharonwas also on the trip for the first time. The Magheralin woman, who previously adopted a disabled poodle called Henry from a Chinese animal sanctuary, said: \"If you saw the horric way dogs bound for the slaughterhouses and meat trade are treated in China, your heart would break. \"You cant physically or mentally comprehend the level of cruelty, so to do something small like flying animals out of there to a new and better le was amazing.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37812018.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/kill.jpg","title":"ulster woman set alight by candle during mass saved by gaa star","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment. He thought everyone was leaving, he was exhausted, his back pay hadnrsquot come through, he had had a row with Cherand he had just got back after being away for a long time.Mrs Mitchell added that she did not blame the army for her sonrsquos death but felt more could have been done to help him.A statement form Rleman Mitchellrsquos friend, Kendall Gibson, also referred to an incident when the  year-old ran away from fireworks.ldquoHe said the fireworks reminded him too much of Afghanistan, stated Mr Gibson, adding that he was also concerned about his friendrsquos drinking.Three soldiers mdash friends of Rleman Mitchell mdash who had discovered his body were sent twice to another barracks in Lisburn for treatment which included counselling.The inquest also heard that it was common place for soldiers to refer to the local army base as ldquoBally-kill-yourself.Driving instructor William Riley, who had been taking Lance Corporal Ross for HGV lessons in the week before his suspected suicide, told the inquest that the soldier was one of many who used the term.Mr Riley told how the Lance Corporal had cut a ldquofrustratedrsquo figure in the week before his death, displayed an attitude problem and had been involved in a verbal altercation with another instructor two days before his death.The inquest continues..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Art","story":"A HIGHLY acclaimed Downpatrick-based charity has secured a signicant financial boost from the Department of Justice.The Le Change, Changes Lives organisation mdash based in Market Street mdash has secured a slice of a near poundm funding cake made available under the government departmentrsquos assets recovery scheme.Over poundm has been distributed to organisations across the province since the schemersquos launch in , with the Downpatrick charity aiming to use its pound, three-year funding package to provide its clients with basic food hygiene training, alongside cooking participation and demonstration skills.The charity helps and supports people suffering with a range of mental health issues and addiction problems, offering professional and confidential counselling, mental health and addiction support and suicide intervention services.It also works to help minimise social isolation, alongside encouraging wellness and recovery and family support.Since its launch, Le Change Changes Lives has provided opportunities for people with a iety of problems to engage in constructive activities, including giving new le to old furniture through the very successful Pop Up Art initiative.The money secured under the assets recovery scheme, which is managed by the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, will finance the charityrsquos No Lost Cause project.Charity officials say the project is designed to provide an ldquointergenerational ersionary and therapeutic community programme which aims to encourage disadvantaged and disengaged people to find their potential and build upon it, using activities, counselling, advocacy, training and support.A logo is being used to publicise the project inspired by the lsquoNot Waving but Drowningrsquo poem by Stevie Smyth which is often told in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. It gives an account of a drowned man whose distressed thrashing in the water was mistaken for waving.Charity officials say the No Lost Cause initiative is designed to complement the highly successful Pop Up Art project which is funded by the Big Lottery until this October.Over the le of the No Lost Cause project, charity officials will strive to reduce crime through erting people away from substance abuse and associated links to criminal activity.Le Change, Changes Lives officials have confirmed that the new project also aims to reduce reoffending by providing training and skills development activities and counselling to deal with substance and relationship family issues and provide support to improve the self-esteem of participants to help them re-engage with family and communities.They hope that through the basic food hygiene training, cooking participation and demonstration project that it will help parents revive cooking healthy, affordable family meals, to be eaten together at the kitchen table, helping achieve interaction and involvement in young peoplersquos livesAilish Teague, who helped establish the Downpatrick charity with her husband Manus, is delighted with the Department of Justice funding.She said competition to secure the money for the next three years was competitive, with groups in each of the provincersquos  councils eligible to apply.ldquoThe application was made through the Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the asset recovery is a brilliant resource, with money taken from criminals invested back into community projects, said Ailish.ldquoWe can use this money for the programmes we deliver, working closely with people who have a range of addictions.ldquoOur clients are also delighted that we have secured this funding which will enable is to deliver an NVQ Level One in hospitality services from our Market Street base with the food hygiene aspect of the course designed to give people a taste of employment.While delighted to have secured funding under the Department of Justice scheme, charity officials are conscious that their Lottery funding ends this October.Mrs Teague says officials have met with Lottery representatives and has suggested that the chances of having their funding extended are ldquozero to nil.She added: ldquoIt will be dficult to secure more Lottery funding which could leave us with no money to finance our core costs including rent and other overheads.

They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues. There was no doubt, they had been given the short straw as the other countries were ready to attack them for their current position in wanting to leave the EU.ldquoHowever, the students put aside their own views and represented the country they were delegated, in this debate.ldquoBeing the UK is what made it so challenging and also so rewarding as they did a fantastic job.Mrs Orsi said: ldquoNot being able to participate in future debates is only one of the educational detriments to leaving the EU.ldquoI think our students are going to be greatly affected on many levels, both in terms of academic opportunities, funding and employment. It is the very people who were not able to vote who will be impacted upon most.Ciara said studying A-Level politics definitely helped the girls flex some political muscle in their challenge.She added: ldquoWe have been discussing Brexit a great deal in class and we felt secure in our knowledge.ldquoHowever, what we did find challenging was trying to find out the positions of other smaller EU countries in terms of their policies on migration and the environment.ldquoI am very interested in politics and as a language student, I feel it is important we are involved in these debates to ensure we continue to develop our understanding of our European neighbours.ldquoWhat is unfortunate is the fact this might be the last time we will be asked to participate as we will no longer be a member state.The debate was organised by the British Council with the aim of developing studentsrsquo intercultural understanding of other countries while learning more about the political workings of the ious states..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch farming family feature on BBC documentary  ","story":"THE trials of farming will be shown through the eyes of a Ballynahinch family as they are featured tonight in the BBC Two series, This Farming Le.Top beef cattle breeder Geoff Rodgers allowed a film crew to capture him and his family work their -acre farm between Ballynahinch and Dromara for most of last year.Geoff inherited the farm when his father died Martin and runs it with his we, Lizzie, who is a special needs classroom assistant at Spa Primary School, with their three children, Emma , Martin , and  year-old Lucy.He admitted that he had turned down previous offers to take part in other farming shows but finally agreed to take part as he was a real fan of the show.The result is a moving insight into what it takes to care for  animals  hours a day and what happens when it all goes wrong.ldquoI think some viewers will be reduced to tears. Well, thatrsquos what happened when all of the farmers featured watched the programme a few weeks ago, said  year-old Geoff.ldquoIt will show that there is a real connection between the family and the animals and itrsquos not all just about sales or winning competitions.Two months before the crew started filming last January, the family were hit with terrible news mdash Bovine TB was discovered in their pedigree herd and  animals had to be slaughtered.A movement restriction then had to put on the herd which meant that no animals could enter or leave the farm until two consecutive TB tests prove negative.The programme catches up with the family on the day a vet calls to carry to do the next test and to determine whether any more of the herd will have to be slaughtered.ldquoIt just happened that the crew came to us in one of the most challenging times for the farm, said Geoff.ldquoAnd while I wonrsquot gave too much away, what happens not only affects me but also my children as they all get involved, especially the youngest Lucy, to help me get the animals ready for the likes of Balmoral Show.ldquoWe not only lost some of the animals but you also lose years of breeding, particularly with some of the animals my father had bred them, which was hard, and then of course, therersquos a knock-on loss of new calves.ldquoIt was particularly hard as I had buyers waiting to buy bulls and cattle of me but we couldnrsquot do anything until we got the all-clear.The tension builds over the next few episodes of the show as the deadline looms to Balmoral Show mdash the highlight of the farming calendar in Northern Ireland and the major sales day for Geoff.Viewers will see that the Rodgers familyrsquos hopes of further success at Balmoral are pinned on bull Mario, who Geoff described ldquoas a real character and his young half-sister, Nadia.This Farming Le starts tonight at pm on BBC ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"British Irish group on High Street conference  ","story":"THE impact of online sales on the High Street was discussed at a recent meeting in Newcastle.Representatives from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were in the resort where they were met by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin.Mr McGrath explained the committee has a dferent area of investigation each year and that in  is focusing on the impact of online sales on the High Street and how governments can deliver initiatives and projects to address the problem.The Assemblyman said with the nature of the traditional High Street changing, many people, especially the young, are shopping online with this trend only going to increase.ldquoWe are seeing and hearing that people want experiences and see their shopping trip as much more than simply shopping, wanting to incorporate food and activities as part of their experience, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHaving clean, welcoming public spaces, areas that can facilitate events and having a erse range of experiential shops and boutiques is critical in making the High Street thrive. In Newcastle, the public realm and promenade schemes, in tandem with the shop front improvement scheme, have helped the resort buck the trend and is reporting increasing footfall.Mr McGrath also highlighted the need to continue to develop experiences people can avail of to maximise footfall and is confident ambitious future proposals including a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes will be critical to enhancing what Newcastle has to offer.He continued: ldquoIn Downpatrick, the former Irish Street police station and car park have the potential to redevelop the town and breathe new live back into its retail centre.ldquoDeveloping a space here which can enhance and deliver a customer experience and product will be critical to developing new shops and products, but also complement existing businesses too.ldquoRates and the entire rating scheme was a major recurring theme from business organisations and this will form part of a report being compiled by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly following their visit.Mr McGrath said the inadequacies of the rating system were well known, with the British-Irish body, of which he is a member, keen to find other ways of helping businesses thrive.The MLA added: ldquoTimes are changing and local authorities and central governments must reflect this in the work they do. I look forward to the report our committee will deliver which will reflect on time spent in Newcastle, Belfast, Dublin, Newcastle Upon Tyne and Stockton on Tees.Cllr Murnin said he was delighted that representatives of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly view Newcastle as an example of good practice for their research into revitalising the high street.He continued: ldquoWe have worked very hard to make our district a better place to carry out business and as a place to visit. Regenerating the town centre and promenade in Newcastle has played a signicant role in increasing business and footfall to the town. I am pleased to see our work receive this recognition.During the delegation visit, local authority officials gave presentations on the regeneration of Newcastle and the tourism events strategy for the town.In addition, a representative from the Department for Communities spoke about the Main Street Environmental Improvement Scheme in the resort and the departmentrsquos role in the resortrsquos overall regeneration.At the end of the meeting, delegation members said the examples of successful regeneration they witnessed would prove beneficial to their enquiryrsquos conclusions and eventual recommendations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan actor adds her opposition to disposal plans  ","story":"SHE may have left the Mourne Mountains to pursue an acting career on stage and screen but the Mournes have not left Niamh McGrady.The Castlewellan-born actress has spoken of her horror at recent media stories which claim the Government is looking to the Mournes as a possible location to store nuclear waste.An area of granite bedrock running from Slieve Gullion in Newry to the Mourne is being considered mdash amongst other locations mdash as suitable for an underground disposal facility, according to a preliminary report by Radioactive Waste Management , a UK State-owned company.Other locations include an area of rock between Omagh and Cookstown, a location between Belfast and Larne, areas around Coleraine, Co Londonderry, and Ballymoney and Ballycastle, in Co Antrim.Niamh, who has starred in Holby City and The Fall, called for all local people to lend their support as Newry, Mourne and Down District Council passed an emergency motion last week unanimously opposing any future facility.ldquoI am absolutely horried to hear about proposals to host nuclear waste in the Mourne area, said Niamh, who now lives in London.ldquoMourne is an area of outstanding natural beauty, which tourists and local people adore the area alike.ldquoWe do not create nuclear energy here, so why should we be treated as a dumping ground  We will all have to pull together to ensure that this travesty absolutely cannot happen.The Mournes are particularly beloved by the actor, who was born and reared on the Bunkers Hill area of Castlewellan.She married her husband, Dan, close to Spelga Dam just last August and regularly walks in the Mournes when she is home.The  year-old also admitted to often feeling ldquoemotional when it came to Mournes as she was interviewed on the lsquoEamonn Mallie: Face to Face withhelliprsquo series for UTV last night.Apart from giving her viewpoint on her support of the   movement, which calls for equal representation of women in all areas of Hollywood by , Niamh also opened up about her own issues with mental health.She told Mallie: ldquoI have experienced anxiety and depression off and on since my teens. Itrsquos something I have always had to be aware of in my own le. I feel very strongly that there are issues in Northern Ireland that arenrsquot being addressed as far as mental health is concerned.A former pupil of St Malachyrsquos Primary School in Castlewellan, Niamhrsquos dficulties compounded after leaving Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch. A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game. Again, they created some opportunities and applied pressure in Enniskillen territory with some great carries from Josh Hanlon, Conor Moag and Joe Charles, but the dogged defence of the locals held out and with it, Down frustration grew which made putting quality attacking play together even harder.In the closing minutes and with the outcome of the fixture already beyond doubt, Enniskillen added a final unconverted try confirming them as the team who would progress to the quarter-finals.The final whistle brought bitter disappointment to the hard-working Down squad who knew they hadnrsquot been at their best on this occasion.The side now enter the Subsidiary Shield competition and they have drawn Royal School Dungannon at home in a quarter-final game to be played on Saturday, February, , at am.Having been finalists in this competition for four consecutive years and winners in , everyone at Down High knows there is plenty left to play for this season..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch horse breeder is a very disappointed man this week mdash and all because of the lsquoflu.

His parents and medical team are constantly working to ensure his lungs remain as clear of mucus as they can be.Jen said: ldquoItrsquos hard to believe when you look at him that anything is wrong as he looks so perfect, but inside him the mucus is causing havoc.ldquoDermot and I never expected to becomes nurses as well as parents to our child. We do his treatment willingly but with heavy hearts.ldquoIf the drugs didnrsquot exist, I think we could just accept things as they are and get on with our lives and make every day count.ldquoBut as it is we canrsquot rest until we have access to Orkambi and the pipeline of drugs for Lorcaacuten and all the others with cystic fibrosishere need.ldquoThis situation makes it dficult to enjoy our son without feeling pain at time passing.The couple, who live off the Vianstown Road, believe that the sooner their son starts on Orkambi the better.ldquoOrkambi not only slows the decline in lungby up to %, it also reduces hospitalisations by up to %, Jen explained.ldquoEvery day people go without access to these drugs is a day in which their body could become more damaged. Since he was  days old, Lorcaacuten has not had a single day without taking some type of antibiotic, as well as  enzymes.ldquoSome people [including young children] with CF have to attend the hospital for two weeks of IVs every three months and thatrsquos considered to be ok when there is a drug that could potentially help Families of CF sufferers believe that Orkambi can lsquostop the clockrsquo on further decline of the patient as they get older.However, the US drug company which developed it has so far failed to agree a price so that it could be introduced by the UK.Jen added: ldquoThe drugs currently in trials are supposed to give sufferers a chance at a near normal le, but this is partly dependent on them being healthy enough when they begin taking them. There is no time to wait.ldquoTwo hundred and twenty six people have died in the UK since Orkambi was licensed over three years ago. We need Orkambi and we need it now.The couple have been lobbying local politicians to get their help at keeping their campaign in spotlight in Government.Strangford MP Jim Shannon raised the plight of Lorcaacuten at Westminster this week.South Down MLAs Jim Wells and Sinead Bradley, along with Lagan Valley MLA Trevor Lunn, are planning to host a meeting in Stormont within weeks with Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.Mr Shannon said: ldquoI was contacted by people throughout Northern Ireland asking me to push government to allow a crown licence for this le-changing drug, as I have been vocal in my belief that this drug should be available on the NHS.ldquoWhat impacted me most was a mother in my area who sent me a picture of her beautul two year-old son with his little mask on, telling me that he was now old enough to get it and it would make such a dference to him.ldquoI supported the calls for the drug and will continue pushing government to find a way to overcome the issue between the drug company and NICE guidelines.While Jen says she has received local cross-party support, she is urging people to sign the petition

technology is to be used to inform peoplethe bathing water at Newcastle beach is safe to swim in.The beach is one of six across the province which features in a new EU-backed initiative to provide people with live updates of the water quality.The resortrsquos beach and surrounding river catchment area has been selected as part of a major new study, with a weather station and river water level recorders already in place to send real time data to a server which the public can access.A new electronic sign is to be erected at the Downs Road car park to provide live updates on the water quality, but the European Unionrsquos so-called SWIM project goes a step further with people able to get information via text messages and internet alerts.News of the new initiative comes just three months after it was revealed that while Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it was a case of lsquomust do betterrsquo for Newcastle, with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs labelling the resortrsquos water quality as ldquosufficient.Details of the SWIM project were outlined at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.Councillors were told those involved in the scheme are working on developing a real time monitoring system, allowing local people and visitors to the beach to check the water quality via a series of measures.Council officials say the innovative project will enable what they have described as ldquoshort term pollution to be predicted.Funded by the Special EU Programmes Body, those behind the project which includes Newcastle, Castlerock, Portrush, Waterfoot, Ballyholme and Ballywalter beaches in Northern Ireland and Clogherhead, Enniscrone and Ladyrsquos Bay in the Republic, say it will help protect public health.In addition, they are confident that it will signicantly improve communication about water quality and contribute to tourism promotion in the resort.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said: ldquoThis new programme is good news for the resort and can have a positive impact on tourism.ldquoThe fact that people will have real time access to the quality of the bathing water builds confidence which is positive.ldquoThere is a problem with nitrates finding their way into the water at the beach and it is something that needs to be addressed.ldquoHowever, the fact that we will soon have a scheme which enables people to know the quality of the water before they take a dip is groundbreaking.Rowallane councillor Harry Harvey, said the decision was good news for Newcastle and could boost visitor numbers.ldquoThis is a forward step for a beach where the water quality has improved from what it was a number of years ago, he said.ldquoThe beach has yet to achieve blue flag status which in part recognises the quality of the water and it would be greatthis could be secured in the long term.ldquoWith the focus on the here and now, the provision of the electronic sign and the availability of real time information is indeed a welcome development and a forward step for the

experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

Mr McAteer was barred by law from acting as a spad because of a serious criminal conviction. However, Sinn Fein circumvented the law by making him a ‘super spad’, putting him over the party’s team of spads and ministers – something which civil servants agreed to, even though it was against the spirit of the law.Stormont Castle has not acknowledged the existence of minutes of the meeting between Sir Malcolm and the DUP and Sinn Fein spads, suggesting that no minutes of the meeting were taken. The following morning, Sir Malcolm emailed his two senior civil service colleagues with a draft of the letter which he had drawn up and asked them for any comments by lunch time.Three hours later Dr McCormick replied to say that he had discussed the issue with Mr Sterling and they had agreed a series of changes to the text. Mr Sterling felt it contained a section on agriculture which was “too long”, something which “unbalances the overall thrust of the letter”.Five days later the amended letter was sent to the private secretaries of the first minister and the deputy first minister. Not a word of that letter was changed by the ministers or their spads before it was sent to Downing Street the following day.Sinn Fein makes unity pitch to civic unionists Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

Pic by Ben LowryMrs McDonald said it was impossible to “undo that damage or that loss” during her speech at the invitation of the fledgling Civic Space group.Although billed as a unionist event, a signicant number among the  or so invited participants were from Sinn Fein or the wider nationalist community, including Michelle O’Neill, Declan Kearney, Tom Hartley, Chris Donnelly and Professor Colin Harvey.The warmest applause of the night was for Belfast businessman Suneil Sharma who questioned whether the Sinn Fein leader’s reference to “changing demography” leading to a united Ireland was a polite way of talking up a sectarian head count.“Are you saying that soon there will be more Catholics than Protestants in Northern Ireland  Is this not the sort of crass, identity politics that is not about reconciliation, but reinforcing tribalism ” Mr Sharma said.Mrs McDonald said that the changing demographics was only one aspect of her belief that a united Ireland is inevitable.In a y speech, Mrs Donald said all suffering during the conflict should be acknowledged and remembered.The party president urged a duty of candour and acceptance of dference, and said reconciliation “sits above” the constitutional question surrounding the creation of a united Ireland.“We have an agreed process to deal with the constitutional question. We now need an agreed process for reconciliation.“I and my generation of republicans will work tirelessly to build a society in which no other parent is left without a child or a child left without a mammy or daddy.”Referencing the Carson-era opposition to an independent Ireland with a parliament sitting in Dublin, Mrs McDonald acknowledged that “in the south, Home Rule did indeed become Rome rule”.However, she said that although some people felt bewildered at the loss of their British identity, “it was mostly women that paid the price in the mothers and babies homes, as slave labour in the laundries”.UUP MLA Alan Chambers blasts Sinn Fein’s ‘double standards’ on legacy Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Rev Chris Hudson of the Non Subscribing Presbyterian Church askedshe now regretted opposing a small Orange Order parade in Dublin in the summer of .Rev Hudson also told Mrs McDonald there would be a better chance of getting an Irish Language ActSinn Fein been involved in pushing for one.Responding to the question about the protests that led to the parade being called off, she said her “politics had changed”.She added: “It was a very fraught situation” with “communities under siege” in Northern Ireland at that time, but parades can be accommodated “where it’s not seen as an encroachment”. The civic unionism event follows a much larger civic nationalist event at Belfast’s Waterfront last month which took place without unionist involvement.Among the audience last night were two young Ulster Unionists, Hannah Niblock, who works in Belfast, and Katie Armstrong, a student at Queen’s University.Hannah said: “No matter what your background you can tell Mary Lou speaks from the heart and she comes across well.”Katie said: “Despite having two very dferent backgrounds we have a lot of things in common in how we can move forward.”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

Does he mean intelligence files “Republicans used to complain about ‘British securocrats’ spreading  information. Now they seem to be setting great store in intelligence files gathered by the same people who they previously said could not be trusted.“I rather suspect that where intelligence files name informants or criminal suspects who are loyalists, Sinn Fein will accept such information as gospel truth. But where intelligence files name republican informants or suspects, this will no doubt be dismissed as disinformation and dirty tricks. “As with their attitude to the EU, Sinn Fein appear to have made a complete U-turn regarding information and files.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquoll update my colleagues in Cabinet tomorrow.mdash Steve Barclay MPFebruary , However there appeared to be little enthusiasm for the proposals ndash intended to replace the backstop with a basic free trade deal combined with technological solutions to avoid the need for physical border checks ndash on the EU side.ldquoWhile the commission engaged seriously with these proposals it expressed concerns about their viability to resolve the backstop, a DExEU spokesman said .ldquoWe agreed to keep exploring the use of alternative arrangements ndash especially how they might be developed to ensure the absence of a hard border in Northern Ireland on a permanent footing, avoiding the need for the backstop to ever enter force.Mr Barclayrsquos meeting with Mr Barnier ndash with Attorney General Geoffrey Cox also present ndash came ahead of expected talks between Theresa May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.In an indication of the uncertainty, Mr Juncker did not rule out the possibility that delays to Brexit could result in the UK still being in the EU at the time of Mayrsquos European elections and participating in the vote.He told German newspaperStuttgarter Zeitung that such a scenario was ldquodficult to imagine, saying it would be a ldquobelated joke of history.Meanwhile it is reported that a group of Cabinet ministers has urged the Prime Minister to stop using the threat of a no-deal Brexit has a negotiating tactic.Theresa May and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker are expected to hold talks Business Secretary Greg Clark, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Scottish Secretary David Mundell warned Mrs May businesses now need certainty the UK will not leave the EU without a deal in place, according to .There was no immediate comment on the report from No .The report comes after rebel Tory MPs last week inflicted another damaging Commons defeat on Mrs Mayrsquos Brexit proposals, heightening fears among some in business of a no-deal break.Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, is stepping up his call to the Prime Minister to re-think her negotiating ldquored lines and back Labourrsquos proposals for a customs union with the EU.The Tories are bungling Brexit while Labour has set out a unying and credible alternative plan.

This has not been taken lightly and we deeply regret how unsettling todayrsquos announcement will be for our people.HUM director Jason Smith said: ldquoWe understand the impact this proposal will have on our associates, wider supplier base and the local community. We are committed to supporting associates to help them through this dficult time.Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ldquoHonda have announced, as part of a global restructuring, plans to close their Swindon plant in  and instead manufacture and export the new Civic model into Europe from Japan. As Honda have said, this is a commercial decision based on unprecedented changes in the global market. Regardless, this is a devastating decision for Swindon and the UK.ldquoThis news is a particularly bitter blow to the thousands of skilled and dedicated staff who work at the factory, their families and all of those employed in the supply chain.ldquoI will convene a taskforce in Swindon with local MPs, civic and business leaders as well as trade union representatives to ensure that the skills and expertise of the workforce is retained, and these highly valued employees move into new skilled employment.ldquoThe automotive industry is undergoing a rapid transition to new technology. The UK is one of the leaders in the development of these technologies and so it is deeply disappointing that this decision has been taken now.Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Phil Smith, chief executive of Business West and Paul Britton, chief executive of Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce, said: ldquoThe automotive industry is a bellwether for UK manufacturing, and has a disproportionate impact on many of our business communities and on our export strength.ldquoThe planned closure of the Swindon plant will have a major impact across the area, affecting not only many employees on site but also firms and staff across the supply chain.ldquoGiven the size of the operation, there will be a wide and erse network of regional suppliers that will now be hugely concerned about their future business prospects.ldquoEmployers, government and local authorities must do all they can to deliver tangible assistance and guidance for the people and communities that will be affected by an announcement of this scale.ldquoThis development highlights the importance of maintaining and attracting investment in local economies.ldquoWhile the automotive industry in general is going through a period of transition, and a number of global factors will have played a major part in a decision of this size, the ongoing Brexit uncertainty and looming threat of no deal is one factor that should have been resolved a long time ago.Dreadful news from Honda and for the wider autos sector. Irsquom determined that @unitetheunion will get more for our members than another task force. The loyalty theyrsquove shown deserves much more than @Honda_UK making for the exit when technology investment decisions get challenging.mdash Len McCluskeyFebruary , Unite national officer for the automotive sector Des Quinn said: ldquoWe acknowledge the global challenges that Honda has outlined in its statement, but we donrsquot accept that this plant, with its highly skilled and dedicated workforce, does not have a viable future.ldquoWe are now entering a period of meaningful consultations with the management to examine in detail the business case put forward by the company.ldquoWe will leave no stone unturned to keep this plant going and its workforce in employment.ldquoWhile Brexit is not mentioned by the company as a reason for the announcement, we believe that the uncertainty that the Tory Government has created by its inept and rigid handling of the Brexit negotiations lurks in the background.ldquoIf the Government had delivered a strong and stable Brexit that protected the economy and jobs, we may well have been in a very dferent position today.ldquoWe have met the company this morning and will be meeting representatives of the workforce at what is an extremely worrying time for our members and their families.ldquoThe impact of any closure on the Wiltshire economy and more widely throughout the UK supply chain canrsquot be underestimated ndash it would be devastating. Thatrsquos why Unite will be making every effort to avoid that catastrophic outcome.TUC general secretary Frances OrsquoGrady said it was a ldquodevastating blow for workers and UK manufacturing.ldquoThe Prime Ministerrsquos refusal to take no-deal off the table is putting thousands of jobs in jeopardy.

This has not been taken lightly and we deeply regret how unsettling todayrsquos announcement will be for our people.HUM director Jason Smith said: ldquoWe understand the impact this proposal will have on our associates, wider supplier base and the local community. We are committed to supporting associates to help them through this dficult time.Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ldquoHonda have announced, as part of a global restructuring, plans to close their Swindon plant in  and instead manufacture and export the new Civic model into Europe from Japan. As Honda have said, this is a commercial decision based on unprecedented changes in the global market. Regardless, this is a devastating decision for Swindon and the UK.ldquoThis news is a particularly bitter blow to the thousands of skilled and dedicated staff who work at the factory, their families and all of those employed in the supply chain.ldquoI will convene a taskforce in Swindon with local MPs, civic and business leaders as well as trade union representatives to ensure that the skills and expertise of the workforce is retained, and these highly valued employees move into new skilled employment.ldquoThe automotive industry is undergoing a rapid transition to new technology. The UK is one of the leaders in the development of these technologies and so it is deeply disappointing that this decision has been taken now.Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Phil Smith, chief executive of Business West and Paul Britton, chief executive of Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce, said: ldquoThe automotive industry is a bellwether for UK manufacturing, and has a disproportionate impact on many of our business communities and on our export strength.ldquoThe planned closure of the Swindon plant will have a major impact across the area, affecting not only many employees on site but also firms and staff across the supply chain.ldquoGiven the size of the operation, there will be a wide and erse network of regional suppliers that will now be hugely concerned about their future business prospects.ldquoEmployers, government and local authorities must do all they can to deliver tangible assistance and guidance for the people and communities that will be affected by an announcement of this scale.ldquoThis development highlights the importance of maintaining and attracting investment in local economies.ldquoWhile the automotive industry in general is going through a period of transition, and a number of global factors will have played a major part in a decision of this size, the ongoing Brexit uncertainty and looming threat of no deal is one factor that should have been resolved a long time ago.Dreadful news from Honda and for the wider autos sector. Irsquom determined that @unitetheunion will get more for our members than another task force. The loyalty theyrsquove shown deserves much more than @Honda_UK making for the exit when technology investment decisions get challenging.mdash Len McCluskeyFebruary , Unite national officer for the automotive sector Des Quinn said: ldquoWe acknowledge the global challenges that Honda has outlined in its statement, but we donrsquot accept that this plant, with its highly skilled and dedicated workforce, does not have a viable future.ldquoWe are now entering a period of meaningful consultations with the management to examine in detail the business case put forward by the company.ldquoWe will leave no stone unturned to keep this plant going and its workforce in employment.ldquoWhile Brexit is not mentioned by the company as a reason for the announcement, we believe that the uncertainty that the Tory Government has created by its inept and rigid handling of the Brexit negotiations lurks in the background.ldquoIf the Government had delivered a strong and stable Brexit that protected the economy and jobs, we may well have been in a very dferent position today.ldquoWe have met the company this morning and will be meeting representatives of the workforce at what is an extremely worrying time for our members and their families.ldquoThe impact of any closure on the Wiltshire economy and more widely throughout the UK supply chain canrsquot be underestimated ndash it would be devastating. Thatrsquos why Unite will be making every effort to avoid that catastrophic outcome.TUC general secretary Frances OrsquoGrady said it was a ldquodevastating blow for workers and UK manufacturing.ldquoThe Prime Ministerrsquos refusal to take no-deal off the table is putting thousands of jobs in jeopardy. She must end this crippling Brexit uncertainty by extending Article  and dropping her destructive red lines.ldquoWorkers at Honda must not pay the price for the Prime Minister playing to the hardliners in her party and we urge Honda to sit down urgently with Unite to discuss a way forward for the plant..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Honda to close Swindon car factory with , job losses article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

The building is being marketed by Osborne King and RHM Commercial. “Given the lack of available grade A office accommodation in Belfast we are excited to bring a building of this size and quality to the market,” Richard McCaig of Osborne King said. “In our experience deliverability of projects is key in order to attract tenants and Lighthouse offers the chance for an occupier to secure the largest amount of existing office space available in the city.” Nick Rose of RHM said it is “extremely rare for an entire building of this quality to become available”. “The superb location combined with a signicant car parking provision will undoubtedly prove attractive to the market. Given that Lighthouse is a few minutes walk from Belfast City Hall and adjoins the -bed Radisson Blu Hotel we expect signicant interest from corporate occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"kainos taking on bankmore square for belfast office scheme","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Tech firm Kainos will take on a massive proposed office scheme in Belfast for its new headquarters, it has emerged.
