A precocious talent, Ray-Jones had won a scholarship from the London School of Printing to study at Yale School of Art when he was 19. He befriended the freewheeling young stars of American photography, Garry Winogrand and Joel Meyerowitz, was mentored by Richard Avedon and returned home in 1965 with notebooks full of strategy. “Get more involved (talk to people),” began one typical list of these notes to self. “Stay with the subject matter (be patient). See if everything in the background relates to the subject matter. NO MIDDLE DISTANCE.”With these principles in mind, Ray-Jones took himself off in a camper van in search of Englishness. He found a good deal of it on beaches – windbreaks and frigid paddling and Thermoses balanced on shingle – and at all levels of pageantry, from Glyndebourne and the Chelsea flower show to local beauty parades and fun fairs. This photograph, in which the horse takes more interest in the cafe than the cafe takes in the horse, was typical of his eye.Tony Ray-Jones died of a sudden and aggressive leukaemia in 1972, his project unfinished. His pictures had achieved a significant following among younger photographers. Among them was Martin Parr, then a student at Manchester Polytechnic, who was “enthralled and excited” by Ray-Jones’s perfectly realised comedies of English manners and took inspiration from them in his own vocation. Parr includes this photograph in a book of Ray-Jones’s English pictures and an exhibition at his foundation. The book stands, he hopes, as a definitive tribute to Ray-Jones’s “ability to make complex images in which every element falls into place”.The English Seen by Tony Ray-Jones is at Martin Parr Foundation, Bristol, Wednesday to 21 December.

Alison Flood wonders if this makes senseIn one of the last glimpses Jane Austen gives us of the world of Sanditon, her final, unfinished novel, Charlotte Heywood has just met Sidney Parker, a young man of “about seven or eight and twenty, very good-looking, with a decided air of ease and fashion and a lively countenance”.Andrew Davies’ TV adaptation of Sanditon, which aired on Sunday, ended with Charlotte and Sidney bidding each other a tearful farewell – in love, but not together. Viewers were teased with the hope of a last-minute reconciliation, as Sidney stopped Charlotte’s carriage. Would he throw honour to the wind and choose Charlotte over Eliza? But the expected happy ever after didn’t materialise. Reader: he didn’t marry her.The ending has enraged and upset viewers, but most of all, I think, surprised them. This is Austen, and we know what we’re entitled to: there’s even a book about it, for goodness’ sake – The Jane Austen Guide to Happily Ever After. Would Pride and Prejudice have been truer to life, more emotionally satisfying, if Elizabeth had accepted Mr Collins’ proposal? No: not least because it would have denied us lines such as: “Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.” Should Marianne have ended up with Willoughby in Sense and Sensibility? No: not least because then we would not have had the glory of Alan Rickman playing Colonel Brandon.“My hunch is that after such a disappointing pastiche composition of bits of ‘everything Austen’ that characterised the series they were maybe trying to capture something of the fragment style of the unfinished original,” says Sutherland. “Much is left up in the air and unresolved: will Sidney’s mercenary marriage save Sanditon and the Parkers from bankruptcy? Miss Lambe’s story is totally unresolved. And what of Sir Edward Denham and Lady D’s fortune?”There’s also a strong sense that ITV is trying to set us up for more. Davies said, ahead of the show’s launch, that he would love to write a second series: “I hope we’ve ended at a point where the audience is going to say: well you can’t end it at that!” The programme makers were also tweeting with an eye to the future on Sunday: “Sidney had to sacrifice his happiness with Charlotte. Divided for now, whatever the future holds for them, their love will endure.” I am expecting a deus ex machina that takes Eliza out of the picture.And as for what the lady herself might have thought? “I imagine she’d have switched to Peaky Blinders on BBC after episode one,” says Sutherland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32eb393650a16a0eeb0f8ff1e175cfbbde9e0feb/75_0_2820_1692/master/2820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6307930edcc4bb8610b1b60d5dbc70f","title":"tell us about your eurostar experiences","story":"The international railway service celebrates 25 years since the first train travelled underneath the Channel.

Genesis had been at the BBC for eight years, but this was different: “I felt what I was hearing was missing voices and perspectives,” she says.The city itself also offered a rich source of inspiration. “I love DC. There is so much art there, it’s got a massive African-American community, a huge intellectual community, and it’s great for jazz and dance music.”After that six-month trip, Genesis, 33, returned to London and founded her arts and culture podcast Stance. “I’ve always liked the immediacy of sound. You can really tell stories with radio,” she says. “Our listeners tend to be people who love arts and culture but like it to be grounded in something real. We love extraordinary stories.”Voices and stories from around the world are something Genesis says she grew up immersed in on her estate in Brixton. “We had Asian neighbours, South American, English, West African, Eastern European – friends from all around. It’s part of who I am. And it makes me curious about different cultures, ideas and experiences.”Genesis’s grandfather moved to Brixton from Jamaica in 1952. “My nan was white British and my grandad was Jamaican – my mum and her siblings were some of the first mixed-race kids around our area,” she says. “Growing up in that culture had a real impact on me.”There is a significant part of Jamaican culture that is associated with Clarks. “Clarks is such a staple for Jamaican people. When we’d visit, we would bring shoes for the family and they would love you forever,” says Genesis. “My late dad had amazing style and he would wear Clarks desert boots that he’d get from their Brixton store. I actually have an amazing book called Clarks in Jamaica by Al Fingers and I love that book. There is also the Vybz Kartel tune called Clarks, which is on a lot of playlists in my house. Clarks has a special place in the hearts of Jamaicans.”When asked how she would describe her everyday style, Genesis considers for a moment before deciding on “layers and layers of black”. But, she adds, she does love to change it up when she can with colourful clothing, shoes and jewellery, which she finds on her travels, mostly in secondhand shops in the US.The power of travel is deeply woven into Genesis’s storytelling. “Sitting in a studio isn’t how I prefer to tell stories I love to take the listeners with me. I recently went to Manchester to make a show about the city’s LGBTQ story. We visited Mumbai in India as well as LA, New York and Philadelphia in the USA. We covered a band based in the Democratic Republic of Congo, who use found objects to make their sound – that innovation was incredible.“I’m lucky because I’ve got family and friends all around the world, and I’m always talking to them, or visiting,” she says, adding that this is reflected in her style and her work.ReadingPonti by Sharlene Teo – the way she portrays girlhood is refreshing.

These weeks are likely to be stormy. MPs could be wrestling with isive Brexit decisions right up to the Speaker’s departure on 31 October, which is also the date of the Brexit deadline. So there will be no gentle cadence about this final farewell. It may all end instead with crashing discord. That would be a fitting send-off to a Speaker who is unprecedentedly polarising but who has been Britain’s most important parliamentarian of modern times.Throughout his decade in office, Mr Bercow has been a controversial Speaker. Originally, he was a rightwing Conservative, but his views have moved to the left. His main support has come from Labour, to the dismay of his own tribe. Many Tories have never forgiven him. Some have come to detest him – a farewell snub from them remains likely. Some of the reasons are understandable. Mr Bercow is often patronising from the chair, and has been far too fond of verbose lectures to MPs. He has been accused of worse behaviour by staff, with charges (which he denies) of bullying and harassment in the Commons. Calls for new leadership have grown louder. On all these counts, there is now the overdue chance of a new start, a better working atmosphere and a tougher approach towards unacceptable behaviour.Brexit has, however, been Mr Bercow’s finest hour. Since the leave vote in 2016, he has presided over an increasingly explosive convergence of challenges to the ways in which parliament and government work. The all-encompassing nature of Brexit’s effects on Britain is one. The impact of a referendum verdict that slashes a deep gash across the sovereignty of parliament is a second. The destabilising effect of the hung parliament that was elected in 2017 is a third. The recent emergence of an unelected prime minister who is effectively at war with parliament is a fourth. Together, these events have generated isions and passions that have come close to bringing parliament to its knees. Few Speakers have faced such sustained parliamentary instability for so long. But Mr Bercow has risen to the challenge. Flawed though he is, a kind of greatness was thrust upon him by immensely difficult events.Mr Bercow is a Westminster moderniser. This remains essential work. He has opened parliament up for visitors and expanded its educational and civic presence. In the chamber, he has consistently championed backbench MPs against ministers, allowing prime minister’s questions to extend to almost an hour. He has pioneered the use of urgent questions and emergency debates, thus ensuring that big issues are debated by parliament when MPs want, not when it is convenient for ministers. On Brexit, he has become increasingly ready to allow backbenchers to challenge the claim of modern governments, even in a hung parliament, to sole control of the agenda. Sometimes it has been messy, sometimes disappointing. Occasionally, though, it has been heroic and in the deepest and best traditions of parliament. With Gina Miller, Mr Bercow has done more than anyone in modern times to ensure that the elected parliament rightly retains the authority to be the nation’s sovereign decision-maker.The question in the Speakership election on 4 November, after Mr Bercow leaves the Commons, is what comes next. By leaving now, Mr Bercow is trying to ensure his successor is not a Tory Brexiter. Many candidates are promising MPs a quieter and more comfortable life. This is worrying and wrong. Parliament is neither a club nor a conventional workplace. It is the engine house of democracy. The Brexit process has strengthened parliament, but in many eyes it has weakened its moral authority. Britain may soon face a “people v parliament” election. The country needs a dynamic parliament that embodies the people of all corners of Britain in all their multiple identities and concerns. It does not need a cowed parliament that bends the knee to a lawless government that claims other sources of authority. Mr Bercow stood up for representative democracy when it really mattered. It will still matter after he goes. Parliament needs a worthy champion, ideally without his faults, to continue his work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/341668674c286c63da473db51d288ecfa342a842/0_147_4395_2637/master/4395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f3825813610909d072c5ed2eee9580d","title":"green new deal banking business economic recession","story":"Having squandered the last crisis, we cannot make the same mistakes again. A Green New Deal is the only reasonable responseAmerican carnage and Brexit collapse, detention camps and environmental breakdown – the daily barrage of bad news makes it easy to forget that these are disparate symptoms of the same disease unleashed by the 2008 financial crisis.Back then, activists in Europe and the US pushed for a holistic cure: a Green New Deal to deliver necessary investments in people and planet. But establishment economists waved them off, preferring a shot-in-the-arm of easy money. Now, all the grave symptoms of recession have returned – and the old drugs don’t work any more, antibiotics to which the disease has already adapted.But now is not the time for I-told-you-so. Never before has so much idle cash accumulated as in the past decade – and never before has circulating capital failed so miserably to invest in human health and habitat. We are long overdue for a Green New Deal.Back in 2008, commentators were quick to announce the death of financialized capitalism. Alan Green, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, was trotted out in front of Congress to apologise for his faith in self-regulating financial markets. Activists occupied town squares from Oakland to Madrid. And even the CEO of Goldman Sachs admitted he had a “reason to regret”. It seemed like radical change was around the corner.It wasn’t. Far from collapsing, banks like Goldman Sachs turned around to record profits, hand out record bonuses, and rehash the risky practices that produced the Great Recession.Mortgage debt – the proximate cause of the Wall Street collapse – is now at levels higher than in the pre-crisis period. The stock of BBB-rated bonds in Europe and the United States has quadrupled since 2008. Public debt has ballooned. And collateralised loan obligations, or CLOs, have surged to $3tn, “reminiscent of the steep rise in collateralized debt obligations that amplified the sub-prime crisis”, according to the Bank of International Settlements.How did this happen? How did the financiers succeed in snatching such riches out of the jaws of their bankruptcy? How did the most severe economic downturn in a century result in a broad preservation of a broken status quo?By a combination of carrots, sticks and tricks.The first two ingredients are well known. The banks, of course, got their carrots. Governments in the US and the EU bailed out their bankrupt private lenders, shifting the mass of their debt on to the public balance sheets.The public would then get the stick. Instead of punishing the irresponsible architects of the crash, our governments punished the pensioners, the poor and anyone who rose up to challenge the regressive cuts they imposed.Less well known are the tricks deployed by governments and their central banks to stabilize the financial system and stave off the growing demand for fiscal stimulus.Among many – swaps, exchanges, special vehicles purposes – quantitative easing was the most impressive, and the most poisonous.To understand how it worked, recall that banks hate one thing more than bank robbers: assets on their books that they cannot lend with interest. After the 2008 collapse, with investment dead in the water, the central banks had pushed interest rates to near, or sometimes below, zero – hoping to kickstart investment. But this drove bankers up the wall, since they could not charge interest to lend their assets.To help them along, the central banks bought trillions of these assets from the banks, using freshly minted cash. One knew that things got silly when the Bank of England bought IOUs issued by McDonald’s.On the surface, the tricks worked. The influx of central bank money ended the recession, shrank unemployment, even revived the United States’ gargantuan trade deficit to its pre-2008 levels. Business-as-usual regained its dominance, and banks were declared safe again.Now, we are heading back into recession – but the old tricks don’t work any more. Rates have been cut, liquidity has been pumped, and the economy remains at a stall. Central banks are simply “pushing on a string”, as the former Fed governor Marriner Eccles once said.If 2008 saw the original development of the Green New Deal proposal, then, 2019 is the time to deploy it: a moment when the architects of the old strategy, pockets empty, no longer seem able to defend it. “There was unanimity,” said Mario Draghi, retiring president of the ECB, “that fiscal policy should become the main instrument.”But fool me twice, shame on me. Having squandered the last crisis, we cannot fall again for Draghi’s promise of a mild Keynesian stimulus in the face of human extinction. Instead, we must mobilize behind the Green New Deal as the only reasonable response to the coming recession.It is tempting to think of the present moment as a crossroads: we either get our Green New Deal, or we descend into eco-fascism. But the fallout from the last recession suggests that – if we do not articulate a shared demand – we might just as easily get a slightly reconfigured version of the status quo: a little more green around the edges, sure, but with roughly the same distribution of power and resources. Such a plan is already under way in Europe, where the European commission now calls for a “green deal” with none of the transformative content of the Green New Deal agenda.With the climate strikers marching on their front feet – and the old guard caught retreating on its heels – we have a clear opportunity to achieve a true systems change. But it will require us to make clear to our governments: it is a Green New Deal or bust."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8987ef6ede9b8b93d1dfdf12c20912db7315b5c/581_544_2321_1393/master/2321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56f5e133a57597265b607c37ac79ed7d","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of dawn","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘dawn’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘dawn’.Share your photos of what dawn means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 16 October at 10am.

Real-life Arachne clues are the basis for a key conversation between Tom (played by Chris O’Dowd) and Louise (Rosamund Pike) before a session of marriage counselling – and the content of the clues is awkwardly appropriate.Unlike with fellow BBC series Inside No 9, this was not a conspiracy. So had Hornby pored over dozens of cryptics to find clues that reflected a marriage under strain? No, he recalls: it was serendipity. “Those clues all appeared on the day I was writing that particular episode.” Hornby is, it transpires, a devotee of this paper’s puzzles. “I love the  crossword and have been a solver for many years – no other newspaper comes close.”And what of Tom’s horror at solving on a printed-out A4 sheet, rather than in the paper proper? This is, it seems, the product of experience. “I don’t like doing crosswords on screens or on PDF unless I have to – when I’m travelling, for example.”Arachne herself was tickled to be told by a pal – Supertramp’s John Helliwell – that she had a cruciverbal cameo. “It’s a gem of a series, as you’d expect from Frears and Hornby,” she says.“We tried to follow Lucy Mangan’s advice and pace ourselves, but ended up bingeing the whole lot in one go,” she says. And yes: as she told us was common in a Q\u0026ampA, she had no memory of composing the quoted clues.Finally, what next for Hornby and cryptics? “One day I would like to set a crossword, but I wasn’t tempted to write the clues myself,\u0027” he says. “It would have taken me hours.” Well, when the time comes, this is a puzzle I would like to see. For the writing and rewriting of clues, the author could, I have discovered, rely on the support of a stalwart setter – Arachne.More crosswords in fiction:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75e629dda4e782f96889846032ceb522692db589/0_186_5573_3343/master/5573.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=764e8a6db8c70024aae9d987fc97134b","title":"is fortnite down is it just hype and is it all elon musks fault","story":"Millions of players just watched as their favourite online multiplayer game was hit by an asteroid and turned into a black hole.

It’s huge.A few hours ago a big asteroid in the game began to flare up and within a short time basically blew up the entire map.You can’t play the game right now. It’s just a black hole. People, naturally, began freaking out.Fortnite also deleted all of its tweets and is running a livestream of said black hole both on Twitter and game-streaming platform Twitch, which around 40,000-60,000 people are currently watching. According to some reports, the total number of viewers across all platforms is more than six million.Some numbers have been appearing around the black hole, and people are wondering whether they’re clues.Millions of people are watching a black hole? Who are these people? How does this game work?Fortnite is an online shooter game where around 100 people are pitted against each other on a small island in a fight to the death until one person is left standing. A lot of time and in some cases money has been invested, particularly by the most hardcore players – so people are wondering if this is the end of Fortnite, or just the start of a new season of the game (a season lasts around 10 weeks).It’s so popular, particularly with kids, because it’s free, easy to use and doesn’t really take itself seriously with blood and gore and lots of things that you often get in other huge online games. Also, it’s kind of addictive.Epic Games reportedly makes up to about US$300m per month from it. That’s largely from players spending money in the game, on outfits and various items for their characters as well as from the battle pass system, where people pay at least US$10 (or 950 v-bucks, in the in-game currency) for challenges that allow them to unlock extra content.In terms of how much people invest in the game, it’s less of an issue than loot boxes (where people pay real money for mystery in-game prizes) – but a law firm in Canada recently launched a lawsuit against Epic Games, claiming Fortnite operated in a similar way to slot machines, and was as addictive as cocaine.In July, people competed for US $30m in prize money at the Fortnite world cup – and you’ve probably seen some of the memes for Fortnite without even realising. Do you remember Ted Danson flossing? Yeah that’s Fortnite.Where Elon Musk fits in is that almost one year ago exactly, he tweeted out a fake news article suggesting he had bought Fortnite just to delete it to “save these kids from eternal virginity”.That tweet has now got about 300,000 RTs, because some people were assuming the fake news became real. Musk, jokingly, even RTed it himself.But while some fans are freaking out that it could be the end (not helped by Epic Games, who earlier Tweeted – and since deleted – about the end coming), it looks like it’s just the end of this current phase of the game. PlayStation has reassured players that they don’t have to worry about their items being lost.Wait, so this is just hype for the next release?I’d say so, yes. It’s likely the new, 11th season will commence soon with changes to the map, and shiny new things.We have seen Fortnite do this sort of thing before, At the end of season seven, big cracks began forming in the ground of the island as a result of earthquakes. Eventually this formed a big volcano – when season eight started.Those keen to know what happens next will have to stay tuned. If you get bored waiting, you can enter the Konami code (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start) and play a Galaga-esque mini game in the meantime. Otherwise, just keep watching the hole."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/026ec250250c7362365ce2082d3e0e257003a3e5/79_0_1597_958/master/1597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f775e84069a3127bdc03fb7d2d27e21","title":"john oliver last week tonight recap national weather service","story":"Last Week Tonight looks at the ‘absolutely incredible’ National Weather Service and the CEO Trump nominated to lead itOn Last Week Tonight, John Oliver embraced a topic crucial to public safety and long elevator rides: the weather. Specifically, the role of the National Weather Service (NWS), a public department which collects a massive amount of data each day, in conjunction with other countries, for accurate and timely weather forecasts.The public service undergirds the private business of weather forecasting – companies such as the Weather Channel, AccuWeather and Weather Underground all rely on NWS data. “Think of it like this: National Weather Service data is to a weather forecast what fresh wolverine meat is to Hormel chili,” explained Oliver. “You can’t make one without the other – it’s the dominant ingredient there.”There’s certainly value to private forecasting companies, Oliver continued. He cited a 2018 interview with Joel Myers, founder and CEO of AccuWeather, in which Myers recounted a time AccuWeather warned the Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder of a storm 20 minutes before lightning struck his stage. The episode demonstrates how the relationship between the private and the public sectors can be mutually beneficial, said Oliver, given that “making sure Eddie Vedder doesn’t get struck by lightning is simply not something the National Weather Service has the bandwidth to do”.There are tensions, however – AccuWeather’s impossible and unreliable 45-day forecast, the Weather Channel naming fickle winter storms despite the NWS’s refusal to cheapen the practice of naming significant tropical storms and hurricanes.But the biggest dispute, Oliver said, is over the private sector’s attempts to curtail the NWS’s capabilities. In 2004, AccuWeather supported a bill in Congress that would prevent the NWS from doing anything a private company does, such as putting content on its website or providing daily forecasts. The bill failed, “which is good, because what you do not want is a paywall system of weather where only paying customers can find out if they’re about to drive into a tornado”, said Oliver.“What the fuck did you just say?” Oliver said, aghast. “That is a weird focus on the safety of a railroad over human life. That’s a man who read Anna Karenina and came away thinking it’s a story about a woman who mildly inconvenienced a train.”People died in the tornado, but actually, that example demonstrated the current system working well, said Oliver – AccuWeather warned the railroad, and the NWS warned the town just a few minutes later, giving residents crucial time to seek shelter. “But what Myers is doing there is marketing AccuWeather as indispensable for public safety, which, thanks to the current strength of the National Weather Service, it isn’t.”“And at this point, you can probably guess what’s coming,” Oliver cautioned – Donald Trump nominated Barry Myers to lead the National Weather Service in 2017. During his confirmation hearing, Barry Myers insisted that he and his brothers would only talk football during Thanksgiving dinners. Oliver didn’t buy it. “Really? You won’t talk about the thing that will vastly enrich your family business at Thanksgiving? Allow me to make a 45-day forecast – bullshit.”Bogged down by conflicts of interest and a labor department investigation into AccuWeather’s culture of sexual harassment, Barry Myers’s nomination has stalled for two years in the Senate if they don’t approve him by the end of 2019, Trump will have to resubmit his name. Which prompts the question: “Why not find another guy?” Oliver ranted.“Any other guy! Except of course, for that to happen, Trump would have to do stuff, know stuff and think workplace harassment is a bad thing, and none of us should be holding our breath on that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f0450b4cfd7dada3fa993fa211e804950f709e5/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a876a6493610937bdc5f8a5899df795f","title":"do you work for a fossil fuel company share your experiences","story":"If you work for a fossil fuel firm, we’d like to hear from you.

In the US, the Green New Deal, spearheaded by the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, aims to virtually eliminate the US’s greenhouse gas emissions within the next decade.Within the energy industry, experts believe the rapid rise of renewable energy in recent years may soon seem glacial compared with the changes to come.Michael Liebreich, the founder of the research group Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), says the substitution of old technology with new is always “like waiting for a sneeze”.The world is about to enter this period of rapid transformation, he says. This change promises to upend the fossil fuel producers that fail to adapt at pace, and bring the rise of carbon emissions to an end. A growing number of energy experts agree.“Over the next decade we’ll see a far quicker than expected rollout of a number of clean energy technologies, which will almost certainly mean global emissions plateau,” Liebreich adds.The rollout is expected whether politicians increase their ambition or not, because the economics of clean energy are now too strong to ignore.Earlier this summer, BNEF reported that not only was renewable energy cheaper than building a new gas or coal plant, but it would soon be cheaper than using existing thermal plants too.This economic tipping point means it would save money to shut existing coal-fired power plants down and build new renewable energy projects from scratch. Abundant clean electricity could help remove the emissions from the world’s transport and heating systems too. has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.The investigation has involved more than 20  journalists working across the world for the past six months.The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965.

The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.By 2030, BNEF expects demand for road fuels to peak, while coal is expected to peak by 2026. DNV GL, a global energy advisory, believes that by the same year oil will no longer be the world’s biggest energy source, and by the end of the 2020s the world’s demand for crude will begin to fall.“It provides a lot of hope,” says Seb Henbest, the lead author of the BNEF report. “It provides a counterbalance to the doom and gloom we face, partly because it includes up-to-date data which tells a slightly different story.”It is a cautionary tale for fossil fuel companies that believe the world’s demand for polluting energy will continue to rise until the middle of the century. It is also a new narrative of hope, he says.“We’re a lot further on than we were. And yes, we need to go faster. And yes, it’s difficult and complicated. But at the same time we now live in a world where two-thirds of the global population live in a country where wind and solar power is the cheapest form of new electricity capacity. We have the tools to do this,” he says.Chris Stark, the head of the UK’s official climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, says the precedent set by the renewables industry proves that emerging technologies to capture carbon emissions can follow suit.The progress to date is not yet enough to meet global targets set in the Paris climate agreement, but a plateau in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 could play a major role in averting catastrophic global heating above 3C. It also proves that further ambition could bring the world closer to the sub-2C goal.“This change is a testament to new climate policies, and the work that has been done around the world. We need to do more of that,” he adds.The UK plans to lead the world’s future climate ambitions. Next year, Glasgow will host the UN’s 26th Conference of the Parties climate talks, known as COP26, to set out a roadmap that keeps rising temperatures well within 2C above pre-industrialised levels.Claire Perry MP, the president for COP26, says the climate talks are “where the rubber hits the road on the historic Paris agreement”. She adds that “expectations are rightly high” due to the “mounting public concern over climate change”, but the UK is ready to deliver on those expectations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c88004f044b18c42574e0152c8dc862c8535da76/0_56_4250_2550/master/4250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9223cdcecd00616f429bd6fb58db9e81","title":"liverpool manchester city premier league win from front pressure hold nerve","story":"After a perfect Premier League start Jürgen Klopp’s team must adapt to the pressure of holding their nerve while well aheadWhen the Premier League resumes at the weekend all eyes will be on Old Trafford to see whether Manchester United can become the first team to take points off Liverpool.On the face of it such an outcome seems unlikely, even if derbies often have a life of their own. United have been terrible in the last few weeks, leading to fevered speculation over Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s future and the wisdom of appointing him in the first place, while Liverpool have sailed on so serenely that Jürgen Klopp’s team building and tactics are now attracting more attention than Pep Guardiola’s at Manchester City.As a long-established football cliché would have it City are looking for a favour from United on Sunday, in which case they might be looking in entirely the wrong place. United are struggling to do themselves any favours at the moment, and after City’s second defeat of the season arrived at the hands of Wolves the defending champions have yet to prove they are capable of taking advantage of any Liverpool slips in any case.A combination of City’s fragility and Liverpool’s consistency has brought about a remarkable turnaround in English football in an unexpectedly short space of time. Clearly it is too early in the season for talk of the title being Liverpool’s to lose or City giving up on the league in order to concentrate on Europe, but a ision which last season prided itself on providing one of the few close-run contests among the major leagues is already running counter to type.Should Liverpool win at Old Trafford to equal City’s Premier League record of 18 successive victories there will be a gap of at least eight points at the top of the table with a quarter of the season completed. Not only would this have been hard to predict last season, when only a point separated the top two teams after 38 games, but it is a new departure for the rest of Europe to take in.In this country we are accustomed to looking a little sneeringly at some of the lop-sided leagues around Europe, with their regular winners and big gaps between title hopefuls and the rest, yet this season England is an exception to its own rule. Look around the rest of the bigger European leagues and the widest margin separating first and second to be found anywhere is a mere two points. Just one win potentially allows Barcelona to overtake Real Madrid in Spain, and the same is true for Nantes behind Paris Saint-Germain in France, Sivasspor behind Alanyaspor in Turkey and even Celtic behind Rangers in Scotland. In Germany, Italy and Portugal only a single point splits first and second, while in the Ereisie at the moment Ajax and Eindhoven are level on points.An eight-point gap in mid-October is right out on its own, and while the season is still young enough for Borussia Mönchengladbach to lead in Germany and the even more obscure Famalicão to head the table in Portugal, should Liverpool manage to beat United it would be their third top-six scalp in nine matches after already accounting for Chelsea and Arsenal. That is last season’s top six, obviously, though as Leicester City are top four at the minute they should probably count too. So it is not the case that Liverpool have not yet played anyone, and while we should perhaps wait until the next two obstacles in United and Tottenham Hotspur have been cleared, the initial theory that the title will be decided by games between Liverpool and City – their first league meeting of the season is on 10 November at Anfield – is weakening by the day.Should City’s woes continue, or put another way should Guardiola persist in playing a high defensive line with Nicolás Otamendi at the heart of it, another pre-season theory will soon bite the dust. It may turn out that the top two are not engaged in a private duel with the rest of the league as spectators after all. City are only a point ahead of the chasing pack, and should a few more opponents come up with the equivalent of Adama Traoré in the coming weeks the two-horse title race everyone predicted may not materialise.It is a safe bet that City will improve significantly when Kevin de Bruyne returns, though with Europe in mind the player Guardiola currently needs as soon as possible is Aymeric Laporte. While City were unlucky with injuries to the French defender and John Stones coming so soon after Vincent Kompany’s release, a situation where Fernandinho is the most reliable centre-back is unsustainable. Guardiola may have to buy in January even if Laporte recovers on schedule in the new year, because it would be a lot to ask of a player returning from a cruciate injury to both slot in seamlessly and restore authority.Liverpool and City’s continental rivals look on with interest, even if we are still only in October. There has been a progression at the Etihad in the last four years, City have steadily improved with each campaign to the extent where they saw off a challenge from Liverpool last season that would have overwhelmed anyone else. That process has now been interrupted, if not yet halted, and if Liverpool are to be beneficiaries they must adapt to the subtly different pressure of holding their nerve while out in front. In his time in England Klopp has seen Leicester, Chelsea and City do exactly that. He has waited patiently for his own chance, and a perfect start has brought it about. Liverpool have stepped out of City’s shadow, and the story of the rest of the domestic season will be how well they cope with the relentless expectation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89fd4883a80b0645de91a83e4ef9d5789f215842/0_203_4300_2581/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0ada8a1daeb0e36eaeab8ec071c5bd1","title":"ryan giggs daniel james wales manchester united","story":"Ryan Giggs’s stance that Manchester United’s Daniel James was being “streetwise” when remaining down following a collision during Wales’s draw with Croatia has been criticised by the brain injury charity Headway.James and Domagoj Vida were involved in an aerial challenge in the 14th minute of the 1-1 Euro 2020 qualifier draw at Cardiff City Stadium on Sunday. The incident appeared serious and left James requiring treatment to his head for around three minutes before the 21-year-old played the remainder of the game. Giggs stated James had passed concussion protocols at half-time.Peter McCabe, Headway’s chief executive, criticised the Wales manager and player. “If that is the case and James was ‘acting’, it raises serious questions about the player’s understanding of the seriousness of concussion,” he said. “Not only has he put his own medical team under intense and unfair scrutiny, but he’s also set a dangerous example for the millions watching at home.“Similarly, we have serious concerns about terms like ‘streetwise’ or that the player was ‘just using his nous’. It is simply not acceptable for teams to use concussion protocols for tactical gain.“Like most people watching the footage of the incident, our immediate concern was for the player’s health. As soon as the incident occurred, he was attended to by the medics who then determined that he was fit to continue. Although it is argued that concussion protocols were followed, the rules state that if a concussion is suspected a player must be removed from the game. To all watching, it appeared that Daniel James lost consciousness.“Regardless of his manager’s comments after the game, this in itself must surely have given enough reason to take a cautious approach.”Giggs had said: “The physio came over but there was no problem. We did all the tests at half-time and he was fine. He stayed down and was a bit streetwise. He told the doctors: ‘I’m not moving, I’m just sitting still.’ Not to get anyone sent off, he was just using his nous.”James said he had not been concussed. He told Sky Sports: “I’m fine. I think he just caught me in the head but I didn’t get knocked out fortunately.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8a2fc897b290c4793c66a6ae712e0103ab9fcbb/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39afed2d9e28906a28de39801dcd82bf","title":"the fiver england bulgaria euro 2020 qualifier","story":"Sign up now!

It seems then that Southgate’s answer to the lack of decent centre-halves is to pick more of them. England will qualify for Euro 2020 if they win and Kosovo fail to beat Montenegro.

It was a game in which the gulf between the teams was clear but Nick Cushing’s side appear a more clinical beast this season, with an embarrassment of riches going forward, a raft of internationals including Janine Beckie, Tessa Wullaert and the electric teenager Lauren Hemp that offers no end of ammunition. Then there is the South Korea captain, Lee Geum-min, who completed the scoring, and Pauline Bremer, who has shone since returning from a broken leg sustained on her City debut. Last season City struggled to put lesser opposition to the sword but they have shown a ruthless streak that will surely stand them in good stead in their quest to take back the title. The same cannot be said for a pointless Birmingham, mainstays of the ision who appear in a sorry mess.Manchester United had nothing to show for encouraging performances against Manchester City and Arsenal but Casey Stoney’s side are beginning to yield results in their first season in the top tier. After swatting aside Liverpool before the international break, United eased past Tottenham, another team relishing the step up this campaign. Stoney, a former centre-back, has built an organised and stubborn United side – they have kept successive clean sheets and conceded only two goals all season – but they are equally beginning to flourish going forward. The arrival of Jackie Groenen has been a big plus, while the form of Leah Galton has been a huge boost. Galton was involved in all three goals at Spurs and her displays must have caught the attention of the England manager, Phil Neville. The uncapped 25-year-old could provide the kind of devilish wing displays Rachel Yankey and Sue Smith did in bygone eras. Galton wreaked havoc on a defensively frail Tottenham, who must have one eye on shoring things up in the next transfer window.A blitz of four goals in 16 first-half minutes set the tempo as Reading edged out Everton 3-2 in an end-to-end thriller but the wise heads of Fara Williams and Jade Moore, who have more than 200 England caps between them, that made the difference in victory. Williams is an evergreen performer in midfield and the 35-year-old’s set pieces pierced Everton’s bubble. Willie Kirk’s side started the season at the league summit but, despite Chloe Kelly, player of the month in September, extending her wonderful start to the season by scuttling in an equaliser from close range, it was Reading who prospered, with Williams supplying Lisa-Marie Karlseng Utland to nod in at a corner. Kelly passed up a gilt-edged chance late on and Reading served a reality check to Everton, who have succumbed to consecutive defeats.Liverpool and Bristol City could not be separated in a game that was a tale of two English players reaping the reward of first-team football at different stages of their careers. Melissa Lawley, who departed Manchester City in the close season and started her career in Bristol, scored her first Liverpool goal to get her new club up and running after a disappointing start to the season. Lawley cancelled out a brilliant debut goal by the 18-year-old Ebony Salmon, who joined from Manchester United in the summer. Salmon curled in from the right flank beyond Anke Preuß before a mazy run by the 21-year-old winger Rinsola Babajide lured Loren Dykes into a foul. Up stepped Lawley, 25, to coolly convertand provide Liverpool with a point they must build on.This season BT Sport will air more women’s football than ever before, continuing with coverage of Arsenal Women vs Manchester City Women on Sunday 27 October on BT Sport"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ef04320f09951536c4b6cf766afbfc6be5918c1/310_112_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c6b5a1a036d2fc9b3e9e2b9fd50dd63","title":"euro 2020 updates china grand plan and a reality cech football weekly podcast","story":"Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Paul MacInnes discuss England’s defeat in Prague, Welsh consistency, Scotland wading through San Marino, Euro 2020 permutations and, er, a reality CechJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Steve, who was a prison officer, had recently moved to the education department to expand his career. “Back then nobody wanted to work in that area but I was keen to spend more time doing one-on-one work with prisoners. I was ready for something new.” They met for the first time while Helen was teaching a class in the prison’s library. “And I always joke that he is long overdue to go back,” says Helen. Although they both liked each other, Steve was reluctant to make the first move. “I was a prison officer and she was a civilian, so I was worried it would have looked inappropriate.”In September that year, Helen left the prison to start a new teaching job. On her last day, she wrote a note to Steve and originally gave it to a colleague to pass on. In the end she plucked up the courage to give him the letter directly, to let him know she was interested. “I had an idea what it might be. It was either going to be her phone number or a note to say get lost, you’ve got no chance,” he says. The pair began dating the following month, pursuing their shared interests of art, opera and musicals. When they met, they had a few concerns about the 13-year age gap, although Helen says it has become much less significant over time. “Steve was 29 when we started going out, and a few people raised eyebrows. It wasn’t a big deal for us though. Age is just a number.”While Steve admired Helen’s intelligence and education, she was drawn in by his fun nature. “I thought he had such a serious look about him, but underneath there is a very silly side. He just couldn’t show it at work.” At the time Helen was working as a teacher and a singer.They married in July 2008 during a silent Quaker meeting. “The vows, or promises as we call them, are spoken but the rest of the meeting takes place in silence,” explains Helen. “Rather than having an officiant, we marry ourselves in front of witnesses at the meeting. Some people can then stand up afterwards and speak with messages for you.” After the meeting the couple celebrated with a reception for friends and family.Not long after they were married, Helen’s father became unwell. “Between 2008 and 2016 we lost three of our parents which was really hard,” she says. They battled through bereavement together – Helen’s parents and Steve’s dad died in that time frame – and it brought them closer. Since then they have developed a passion for travel and visited many countries. “We have been all over the world, to Africa, Nepal, India, China, Australia and Brazil. I love that Steve is always up for anything and always enthusiastic. We do crazy things and change our plans at the last minute just because we can,” says Helen. That “can do” attitude is also something Steve loves about his wife. “I remember once we went white-water rafting after a difficult six-hour trek. Helen was absolutely terrified, but she still got in the boat and did it. She never gives up. It’s one of the things I most admire about her,” he says.The couple attribute the success of their relationship to a close friendship and a taste for new adventures. “I was an opera singer until I was 37, then a teacher and now I do some writing and composing. We are always reinventing ourselves and trying new things,” says Helen. “It’s so important to be able to do things together,” says Steve. “I think chemistry is superficial. When you really love someone you choose to invest that time in them.”While the pair admit they have taken an unconventional path compared with other couples, they believe it has helped them to build a stronger bond. “We are never stagnant and we never say still,” says Helen. “We have shared dreams and goals and I think that is really important for keeping a relationship alive.”Want to share your story?

Of course you have. But with help you can move on …How many grudges do you have at work? The workplace grudge can spring with equal force from small and large hurts. These may range – allow me to try to imagine – from the seemingly accidental negligence of the person who changed the toaster setting in the canteen so that your breakfast bagel burned, to the larger disappointment of being overlooked for a job. In my – former – workplaces, I visualised grudges as small red flags fluttering above the heads of certain colleagues. This can’t be healthy. So why are grudges so powerful, and what is the best way to manage them?As a former professional cricketer who had to compete for selection, Sylvester has first-hand experience of grudges. He was also unfairly overlooked for a job once – although this was a validated grudge because one member of the interview panel thought Sylvester had been wronged, and phoned him later to apologise. The key, he says, is “to hold the mirror” to your grudge. “What does it really say about you?”Sylvester’s job is “massaging out the pain of the grudge” in workplaces. “That’s what I do every day.” For those who can’t get themselves to a grudge spa (or to talking therapy), Sylvester advises asking three questions. First, what emotions are being evoked by the person you hold a grudge against? Second, what does that say about you? “We inherently want to avoid the truth about ourselves,” he says. This is the time to accept that you could have stepped in to readjust the toaster setting if you were less passive in social situations, or told you could have prepared more effectively for the job interview. The third step is “self-correction”, such as: “I’m going to cheerfully guard the toaster each morning until my bagel is cooked,” or: “I’m going to look at a number of opportunities in the company to upskill myself.”Renshaw thinks that role-playing the begrudged person, or writing out their supposed thoughts, is more helpful than merely thinking about them. Our heads are not always the best places to do this. “There’s too much jumping around. It’s more exacting to write down the thoughts or say them aloud. They become more real when you hear yourself.” Mind you, Renshaw says he has never had a work grudge, being “one of those annoyingly glass-half-full guys”.A grudge can be dissipated by following Renshaw’s or Sylvester’s advice – or it can be transmuted, as in the case of the crime-fiction writer Sophie Hannah, who has written a nonfiction book called How to Hold a Grudge. A grudge, she says, is simply “an instructive story that we choose to learn from, not a lasting feeling of resentment. This enables us to honour our most significant emotional and psychological experiences and commit to our highest values.”In any case, isn’t there a pleasure to be had from a well-nourished grudge? Sylvester describes lighter grudges as something “to be picked up and put down like a newspaper”, almost like a leisure activity. The author Joanna Cannon wrote on Twitter that she feeds and waters her grudges “as if they were small exotic plants”. And William Blake’s poem A Poison Tree is perhaps the seminal work of grudge literature. Surely it’s OK to reserve a small, manageable dose of dislike for someone? Emma Donaldson-Feilder, an occupational psychologist, doesn’t think so. “Actually, I think that’s really unhealthy for most people. I would define a grudge as holding on to something beyond the point that it’s useful … It’s a stone in your shoe,” she says.If you have used the original hurt to motivate you, but the hurt still remains, “it may be helpful to let go” says Donaldson-Feilder. This feels vaguely disappointing. It doesn’t seem so very wrong to keep the motivation and the grudge. “Mmm,” she murmurs sympathetically. “But having negative feelings towards someone is always going to be a bit destabilising. It comes down to compassion, and being kind to ourselves and valuing ourselves.”At least after this I should have a clear run at the toaster tomorrow.

But he ended up rerecording it as a duet’Ian and Andy did the horns on Coldcut’s first album, and I sang a song with them called My Telephone. After hours we all went back in to the studio to see if we could come up with anything together, and the result was People Hold On, a massive hit. Because everyone said it would look clumsy with two bands’ names on, it was released as “Coldcut featuring Lisa Stansfield”. When we went back to our own music, they said, “Well everyone knows you as Lisa Stansfield now” and that was the end of Blue Zone. But I wanted my mates with me, even though it was my name on the record. That triangle of people was very strong.All Around the World was something we wrote together. I came into the studio, and Ian was messing around at the piano. He had a melody, and I just started singing: “Been around the world and I, I, I…” Everyone laughed but Ian said, “Wait, it’s really good, that.” It just came into my head – it was nonsense, but had a really good feel to it. “I, I, I” became the main hook. We’d no idea how massive it would become.I was the first white British woman to reach No 1 on the R\u0026ampB chart – the American black music chart. I remember sitting in a hotel room reading all the different charts around the world and just going: “Fucking hell!” All Around the World was top of most. Over the years, a lot of people have told me the song helped them through a difficult period. That’s beautiful, to know you’ve helped someone in that way. The song literally took us around the world, four times. I suppose you have to be careful what you sing, because you might have to do it.Blue Zone was signed to an indie label, then Arista bought the label, so we ended up on a major by accident. We made a mainstream pop record and they needed a B-side, so we knocked out this song called Big Thing in an eight-track studio behind Lisa’s mum and dad’s house. It was more soul than pop, and got more attention than the rest of the record. The label asked if we had any other songs like that, so we played them All Around the World.The song came together really quickly. Once Lisa had all the lyrics down and I’d done a basic track with Andy, the whole vocal was two takes: one lead vocal and one take for single harmony. She just went in and sang it. The vocals from that original eight-track recording are what’s on the global hit. We put real strings on it at Strawberry Studios in Stockport, but otherwise it was all low-budget and DIY. It’s hilarious, really.The lyrics – about searching the world for an estranged lover – aren’t from personal experience. Lisa tends to make up stories and she’s good at putting herself in someone else’s shoes. If you write down “been around the world and I, I, I, I can’t find my baby” it sounds nonsensical, but there’s obviously something that connects emotionally. It leapt out to other people far more than it did to us. For us, it was one song in a group of five that we thought were good. But as soon as our manager, Jazz Summers, heard it, he went: “That’s it!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93be58ff31a411a9c957f5205d763b0d8f50a184/0_290_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc2355393649723ffebb69969bf83ccd","title":"tricky interview","story":"The pioneering musician was raised among gangsters and has battled with anxiety, as documented in his new memoir. But nothing could prepare him for the grief of losing his daughter this yearUntil recently, Tricky had a picture of his mother as the screensaver on his phone. He never got to know her properly – she killed herself when he was just four years old – but he had gone through life believing that she was out there, somewhere, keeping an eye on him.“And I did believe that,” he says. “Until 8 May this year. Because that was the day my world ended. So if she was supposed to be looking after me, what the fuck’s happened?”The date he is referring to is the day his daughter Mazy – also known as Mina – died at the age of 24 (there is currently an ongoing NHS trust inquiry into the cause). At the time of her death, Tricky put out a brief statement saying: “I thought I knew what loss was, but now my daughter is gone I realise I had no idea what it was after all.”Today, several months on, he still sounds utterly bereft: “I’ve lost my belief,” he says at one point. “Hopefully I will get it back.”He is here to talk about his autobiography, and you wouldn’t, on the surface, know that he was grieving. We are sitting at an outdoor bar alongside Regent’s canal in north London. Tricky is drinking “water with bubbles” and smoking rollups. He is outgoing, cheeky and full of warmth. He speaks with a thick Bristolian burr, loudly and quickly, a surprise to people who have heard his music – which can be dark and claustrophobic – and expect a moody personality to match.The memoir charts Tricky’s unlikely rise from young Bristol tearaway to one of British music’s most creative visionaries. His hushed style of rapping, unusual production methods and ability to reconstruct soul, punk, reggae and hip-hop into strange new shapes has long left critics scrabbling for words to define his 13-album career. He hates being called “the godfather of trip-hop” – hates the phrase “trip-hop”, in fact – but it is probably as close as you will get to a neat label and it is hard to argue with.Tricky shaped the sound of Massive Attack’s landmark 1991 album Blue Lines, and four years later – thanks in part to the beguiling vocals of his then partner and the mother of Mazy, Martina Topley-Bird – changed the face of pop with his baffling, beautiful debut solo album, Maxinquaye, named after his mother.The book’s title – Hell Is Round the Corner – is taken from a track on Maxinquaye, and it aptly describes a life in which violence and tragedy have lurked beside every success story. Born Adrian Thaws and raised in Bristol by his grandmother and aunties, Tricky had a happy, but unconventional, childhood: food often consisted of rabbit stew sourced from the family’s poaching expeditions criminality was an accepted way of life.Without his musical gift, Tricky’s prospects would not have looked bright: “Where I come from, a lot of people are either on drugs, in prison or dead,” he says. His uncles were gangsters and Tricky grew up noticing how people would treat him differently whenever their names were dropped: his food in a curry house would be upgraded the atmosphere in a pub might suddenly change.“Once, I asked my auntie why everyone was scared of my uncle Martin,” he says. “She said: ‘Because if he says he’s going to cut your throat, he’ll cut your throat.’”He saw unimaginable violence from a young age. Several social workers, including his other daughter, Marie, have read his book, and told him that the way he was brought up would, in their professional eyes, count as neglect.But that is not how he sees it. He loved life in Bristol’s Knowle West, a tough, predominantly white neighbourhood, and says his upbringing was full of affection. Still, you can see where the social workers are coming from. His grandmother would often say things like: “‘Oh, it’s cold today, you don’t wanna go school, stay at home with me.’”She would also tell him to always empty his pockets before going out, in case he accidentally left something behind at a crime scene. “What I consider normal ain’t really normal,” he concedes.Perhaps the most startling example of this in the book is when he introduces a character from his youth as a “lovely guy” and then, a paragraph or so later, breezily mentions that said character had also shot someone in the neck. Tricky pauses when I mention this, as if trying to work out who I’m on about. Then he breaks out in an explosion of affection: “Oh, Wayney Lomas! Yeah! Aw, Wayney was a brilliant guy! But yeah, he got found with his head chopped off. They shot him in the head, in his house, then took his body, chopped him up and put him in a concrete floor.”Er … who did?“They don’t know who did it. But he was a lovely, lovely guy. But yeah, he’d shot someone in the neck, apparently.”He checks my startled reaction to this tale and laughs. Is it any wonder, he says, that his music can sound dark to some people? Darkness is what he has always known. His first memory is peeking into his mum’s coffin while it was resting in the family home before burial. Didn’t that mess with his head a bit? “I don’t think it would be a great thing, would it?”The men in his life were tough guys, but the women who raised him were tougher. He saw his grandmother and aunties street-fight like his uncles (“The fighting was more vicious, cos men care more about their ego”) and observed them being strong in other ways, too: running the household and feeding the family while the men were away doing time.“I’ve a kinship with women,” he says. “That’s why I’ve always put women in strong positions in music.”Topley-Bird was the most important of these. He met her by sheer luck in about 1992 – she had been singing with schoolfriends outside his house. A few years later, they became a couple and had Mazy together the relationship didn’t last, but they continued to collaborate musically on several more albums.That music as restless and ruthlessly experimental as Tricky’s found commercial success is perhaps surprising, not least to him. He expected to be an underground producer – instead Maxinquaye went to No 3, and was followed by a string of Top 40 albums. His sound became hugely influential and he was sought after by everyone from David Bowie to U2. Everyone wanted to be associated with him – even Samantha Cameron claimed to have spent time hanging out with him while she was at university in Bristol (Tricky has always remained sceptical of this, saying he has no recollection of her).But he didn’t enjoy being in the limelight. A tempestuous relationship with Björk turned him into a tabloid fixture for a while, and he increasingly tried to self-sabotage his career. One time, in New York, he failed to turn up to a meeting in his hotel with Madonna because he wanted to sleep instead. He was also terrible when it came to money. He knows that he once owned a house in New Jersey with acres of land around it, but he can’t remember where exactly it was, how it got sold or where the cash went.His mental state wasn’t helped by the amount of weed he was smoking, while he believes candida – a yeast infection rarely taken seriously by conventional doctors – was largely responsible for some of his more erratic behaviour. Even without these problems, the spotlight of fame didn’t suit him. His subdued rapping style comes, he says, from shyness the same goes for his live shows, which use minimal stage lighting: “It’s all lack of confidenceThis proved to be an issue in 2011, when Tricky was invited by Beyoncé to appear as a guest vocalist for her headline set at Glastonbury. He says he wanted to say no, but his manager insisted, so he wrote a verse to perform during her song Baby Boy. When he got on stage and saw the lights, huge crowd and celebrity faces – Chris Martin, Jay Z – staring back at him, he froze. “I wasn’t ready for it … it was too much,” he says. “I told the press that my mic wasn’t working, but it was working fine.”Anxiety has sometimes overcome him in more destructive ways. In his book, he talks about living in Los Angeles in the 00s, when he would keep an Uzisubmachine gun underneath his bed for protection. Would he have been prepared to use it?“This ain’t bad-guy talk, cos I’m not a bad guy,” he says. “But people don’t realise what fear can do. I’ve had situations where I’ve been so scared, where I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, and it’s gone on for weeks and it’s ruining my life. It makes you sick, it makes you mentally ill.”He continues: “So I had this person – I can’t tell you who – on my mind day and night. And there was a chance I could bump into them. My mate brought me over some gloves, a different gun, and I had to polish the bullets so you don’t leave your finger prints on them. And then I went out in the car, to see if we were going to bump into each other.”He notices my eyes widening – not for the first time today. “Fear can be very dangerous. You should never make someone too scared of you.”Processing emotions has never been easy for Tricky. He admits he was a terrible, absent boyfriend to Björk. She apparently told him he was “emotionally numb”. And it is true that, throughout the book, there is a sense of indifference to some of the people and situations in his life.But it is striking how Tricky shakes off that detachment whenever he writes about Mazy. When talking about her, he is anything but emotionally numb: he recounts with love taking her on Australian tours (where she was babysat by Perry Farrell of Jane’s Addiction, of all people), and buying that house in the New Jersey wilderness so she could play safely away from the New York streets. His adoration for her is so clear and, now, so heartbreaking.“One of the biggest problems with my daughter is that I’ve never loved anybody that much before,” he says. “I was there at her birth. And all of a sudden I started feeling things. And it was too much for me. Because I was emotionally numb, and it was easier for me to get through life being emotionally numb, but then suddenly I was feeling things.”He tries to explain how he’s feeling now. “I’ve lost people before, like grandmothers, but I’ve bounced back,” he says. “This is different. Everything looks different, even music doesn’t sound the same. I feel like I’m losing my mind.

Like, really good.” But getting through each day is tough. He says there is a girl in his apartment building in Berlin, where he lives, who is the spitting image of Mazy. When she was alive, he even connected the pair of them on FaceTime, just to freak them both out. “And now, when I see her, it’s like: ‘Whoa!’”Mazy was a musician herself, and Tricky has plans to work on some of the songs she left behind. He already has two tracks that he wants to put on his next album. There are other things, too, that give him hope. Like the time a “white ghetto dude” stopped him in Notting Hill and said: “Your music got me through prison.” Or the moment a young Texan revealed that his family had played Tricky’s music to him while he was in a coma. Then there’s the nurse in a Chicago burns unit who told his drummer they played his music to the kids there. “That’s when I knew: ‘This ain’t just about me,’” he says.He has been thinking of these stories a lot recently. About how others have found something in his music that has got them through.“I never thought of my music as dark,” he says before we part. “It can’t be that dark to get people through a dark period, can it?”He gives me a huge embrace before he leaves, an acknowledgement that it has been a difficult conversation for him. He is going through unimaginable darkness right now, but hopefully he, too, can find some light.Hell Is Round the Corner is published by Blink on 31 October.

The European commission has suggested member states should take a “generous” approach, but apart from Ireland none of the EU member states are said by citizens groups to be offering terms on a par with the approach taken by the British government.In the event of a no-deal exit, the estimated 3.6 million EU citizens who reside in the UK would have until the end of 2020 to register for settled status through a free online application in which they need to prove only their identity and that they live in the UK, and declare any criminal convictions.Despite the repeated calls by the European parliament for the UK to improve its offer, many of the estimated 1.2 million British nationals living in the other 27 EU member states would be in significantly worse situations.Jane Golding, the chair of the lobby group British in Europe, said her members were now pushing for an EU-wide solution to be ringfenced in the event of Britain’s membership of the bloc being extended beyond 31 October.“If there had been a ringfenced solution, in a no-deal scenario you would have an EU-wide solution. But what we are facing now is 27 different solutions,” she said. “In effect it is a European postcode lottery, and rather than our EU rights being safeguarded at an EU level, our rights are being outsourced to the 27 countries.”Kalba Meadows, a psychotherapist who lives and works in France, said the biggest problem facing Britons in her adopted country was its six-month grace period for applications that do not arrive before Brexit day.She said: “It’s one of the shortest in the EU27, which is surprising when you take into account that France is the only EU27 state that doesn’t require registration of EU citizens, so it’s a case of starting from scratch, unlike, say, Germany or Spain where everyone should already be registered. It’s hard to see, frankly, how 150,000 to 200,000 people are going to be able to register within such a short timescale, even in a perfect world.”Boris Johnson has said the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, “no ifs or buts”, and it looks increasingly unlikely that a deal will be secured with Brussels at a summit this Thursday.A UK government spokesperson said: “The government has given an unequivocal guarantee to EU citizens living and working in the UK that they can have absolute certainty of the right to live and remain in the UK after Brexit. We continue to urge all member states to reciprocate fully for UK nationals the guarantee that we have made to EU citizens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2254d56c9f50ad7011e0dbc6a7000bef881f3398/0_328_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4d073b672381c4a37cb38f8a5dedb77","title":"makes monty python look like panorama readers on the queens speech","story":"You have been reacting in the comments to the Queen’s speech and the state opening of parliamentThis is all pointless isn’t it?

They decided that it looked like any other comet except that it came from beyond the solar system and would soon leave for good.The unusual body was spotted in August by a Crimean amateur astronomer, Gennady Borisov. It was swiftly identified as an outcast from another star system and may have been wandering the Milky Way for millions if not billions of years.“This is the first comet known to science that arrived from outside the solar system, and it is completely similar to those we see inside the solar system,” said Michal Drahus, an astronomer at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland.The team, led by Piotr Guzik, gathered images of the comet after receiving an alert from a computer system that detects cosmic interlopers. Unlike comets and asteroids that formed in the solar system, the arrivals are on trajectories that do not swing around the sun.Pictures from the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma, Spain, and the Gemini North telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, revealed that 2IBorisov has a coma – a billowing cloud of dust and gas that surrounds a comet’s nucleus – and a short, fat tail. Both are created when ices on the comet’s surface sublimate into gas and blast dust and vapour into space. Details are published in Nature Astronomy.The observations confirmed that the reddish body is a comet with a nucleus about 2km wide. It is only the second interstellar body to be spotted in the solar system, after the apparently more rocky and cigar-shaped Oumuamua, which was tracked in 2017 as it barrelled out of the solar system at 196,000mph.Comets are what is left over when a planetary system forms, and the similarity of 2IBorisov to solar system comets suggests our own planetary system is not unusual in the Milky Way. “The first thing it tells us is that at least some other planetary systems around other stars are similar to ours,” said Guzik.Scientists are unsure where 2IBorisov comes from, but another Polish research team has tentatively traced its trajectory back to a star system with twin red dwarves called Kruger 60, 13 light years from Earth.The new comet tore into the solar system several years ago from an angle of about 45 degrees north. In October 2015 it was as far away as Neptune, the outermost planet, and now it is between Mars and Jupiter. On 27 October it will cross the plane of Earth’s orbit. The early detection means astronomers will be able to observe the 71,500mph comet as it makes its closest approach to the sun on 8 December, when the extra heat will make the comet more active and its tail longer.Colin Snodgrass, an astronomer at Edinburgh University and a member of a team that has separate observations of 2IBorisov coming out in Astrophysical Journal Letters, said: “This appears to be a completely unremarkable comet on a very remarkable orbit.”“It’s very interesting that this interstellar comet looks like our own ones,” he added. “It implies that some of the formation processes we are trying to figure out with detailed observation of comets and asteroids, or space missions like Rosetta, are common between stars.”A new mission being developed for the European Space Agency will send a robotic probe into space to intercept and study a passing comet. Geraint Jones, the head of planetary science at UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and the lead proposer of the Comet Interceptor mission, said the primary target would be a pristine, unaltered comet arriving fresh from the Oort cloud, a distant region of the solar system where comets reside. “But we on the proposing team made it clear that if an interstellar object could be reached instead, it would clearly make an extremely compelling target,” he said. Launch is scheduled for 2028."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1538fbaa5e8b2f21ab327cfd896878e7ac73de6b/0_148_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8c6358d2a9e30662d82ab3f38edd15a","title":"japan south africa rassie erasmus rugby world cup","story":"• Coach says South Africa have erased memory of Brighton 2015• ‘The way the Japanese people have adopted teams is special’Japan is waltzing at an oval ball. South Africa spent the first week of the tournament here preparing for their opening match against New Zealand, enjoying relative anonymity, but when they arrived at their Shinjuku hotel on Monday evening they realised as soon as they stepped off their coach that they were in a different World Cup.Such was the clamour for their opening media conference in the lead‑up to the quarter-final against Japan at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday that a new, larger room on their hotel’s banqueting floor had to be hastily furnished, all rather different to when they were based in the city’s Disney resort and two dozen chairs were more than was needed.“You can feel the vibe,” said the South Africa head coach, Rassie Erasmus, whose wing Cheslin Kolbe is fit to play on Sunday. “They are excited about it and they should be because their team is doing well. It is not a surprise that they are in the quarter-finals. After we played them last month, I said I thought they would be first or second in their pool. They are up to seventh in the world rankings and we know we are in for a very tough game.”When South Africa last prepared to play Japan in a World Cup, the Brave Blossoms had won only one match in seven tournaments, against Zimbabwe in 1991. Their victory against Scotland on Sunday was their sixth in a row, but the catalyst for their remarkable improvement came that day in Brighton in September 2015 when the Springboks, winners for the second time only eight years before, became the victims of the game’s greatest act of giant-killing.Erasmus, however, believes the Brighton game has no relevance now after the 41-7 victory in Kumagaya last month. “The reason for that warm‑up was to erase the 2015 game so that if we got them in the knockouts that day would not be mentioned,” he said. “It is 1-1 now. Brighton is in the past. Both teams have improved since last month and it will be interesting to see how each of us handles the pressure of expectation on Sunday.”South Africa, like all the teams here, have been overwhelmed by the courtesy of their hosts wherever they have played. “It has been the best experience of my long career,” said the prop Tendai Mtawarira, who made his Test debut 11 years ago. The warmth of a welcoming people has made us feel at home. They are great hosts whose team has been playing well. It will be massive on Sunday.”Asked if he relished his side gatecrashing what has become some party, Erasmus replied: “It is really tough not to like Japanese people. The way they have adopted teams, putting on your jersey and being so welcoming, is something I have never experienced in my life before and is really special. The way they handled the typhoon, and condolences from the Springboks go to all those who lost loved ones, shows their strength.“Saying that, we are playing for our country and want to win the World Cup. Japan is the enemy, but only for the next week. We love the country and the people but we have to try and beat them. What has really impressed me about their team is the way they have handled the pressure. They are a very well coached team who adapt to the opposition they are playing. They play to their strengths and your weaknesses which makes them a very tough opponent.”Japan’s initial target was to make the knockout stage for the first time but their captain, Michael Leitch – after a night without sleep – said that after four wins out of four they would now not regard that achievement as good enough. “It is scary to think how far we have grown since 2011,” he said.“Confidence is building and we really felt the support of the fans during the victory over Scotland. The goal is not here and we are preparing to beat South Africa. We will fight to win and create more history for Japan. We have got used to pressure and what is important is what is ahead of us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2a5fd264f5ac7ba745792c819545438bc83cb7e/0_1140_1647_987/master/1647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f85175959a8c4c3fbd16ae12deacd3b","title":"armchair viewers laser guided rugby union kipchoge","story":"While the glorious phenomenon that is Simone Biles was winning a fifth all‑around world gymnastics title last week with routines that included a triple-twisting double backflip during the floor exercise and a two‑flips‑two-twists dismount from the beam, she was doing things that the human eye could barely take in. But there were no worries that what she was doing might be missed.Her every movement, and those of her 546 rivals, was being captured by three-dimensional laser sensors hidden inside boxes placed around the floor of the Stuttgart arena. Developed by Fujitsu, the system has at its centre an artificial intelligence system. Body measurements are taken from the competitors – in the case of the few who declined in Stuttgart, a standard template was used – and their movements are then tracked for position, angle and speed, instantly processed and fed to the competition judges in graphic form as a clear real-time analysis of every performance.That, you might think, will settle everything. No more Eurovision-style complaints about the Belarus judge favouring the Russian competitor. No more claims of the Chinese marking down the USA team, or vice versa. In theory, at least.In sports where artistry is not a consideration, however, the future beckons – and it would appear to be laser-guided. There was a glimpse of it when Eliud Kipchoge broke two hours for the marathon distance, following a wedge of pacemakers whose eyes were glued to the green laser lines beamed on to the road surface in Vienna from an SUV with a throttle specially tuned and controlled so that its speed could be adjusted in increments of 0.1kmh.Admiration for Kipchoge’s magnificent million-dollar achievement was only slightly undermined by the information that he was wearing a version of Nike’s Vaporfly running shoe so new that it has not yet been homologated by the governing body. Like other aspects of his run, such as the use of roll-in, roll-out pacemakers, this made it clear that his feat belonged not in the realm of sport but in the related field of science-assisted human performance. What you might feel about the value of such an achievement when it is entirely orced from the sphere of rules-based competition is entirely up to you.But laser sensors would have come in very useful in a piece of proper sport on Sunday, when Wales’s backs persisted in throwing forward passes while trying to score during their Rugby World Cup pool match against Uruguay in Kumamoto. In the end these infringements of the game’s most basic rule did not cost them victory and passage to the quarter-finals, but they were careless and frustrating. And not wholly surprising, either, since it is some time since greater fitness and more advanced tactical thinking persuaded coaches to bring attacking lines into flatter alignment, with the aim of finding gaps or engaging the opposing defence as quickly as possible.The debate over what constitutes a forward pass between players running at speed flared up a few years ago, with all manner of brave but inconclusive attempts at scientific analysis. Video refereeing has meant that infringements are more easily spotted, but – as with VAR in football – they have also tended to make the referee on the pitch more reluctant to blow the whistle, secure in the knowledge that the technology will absolve him by providing a definitive verdict.With five minutes to go on Sunday, Hallam Amos scored the third of his touchdowns to be disallowed. The first two had been chalked off for forward passes after being referred to the TMO. The third was actually disallowed for his inability to hold on to the ball as he ed over by the corner flag. In fact it should already have been disallowed for the forward pass preceding his final dash. But that was never even considered. Weirdly, Angus Gardner invited the TMO to adjudicate on the second offence rather than the first.One day perhaps international rugby players will be measured in the same way as the gymnasts in Stuttgart, tracked in real time by laser sensors placed along the touchlines. The ball, too, will be tracked, and the TMO will be able to see without recourse to the naked eye whether it travelled forward as it passed from one set of hands to another. If nothing else, that would speed up a process that can be infuriatingly protracted and does not always deliver an undisputed verdict. And, through some kind of red-button option, viewers at home would be able to decide whether they wanted to watch a match with the laser lines and other data on display – somewhat in the manner of the course and wind overlays in the America’s Cup telecasts – or au naturel.Everybody wants accurate decisions and there is certainly an audience for more detailed analysis. But once this television-influenced path has been chosen, it is impossible to know where the journey will end, or what effect it will have on the uncertainty, the wonder, the exhilaration and the arguments that made sport more than a thing of statistics. But at least as long as Simone Biles is around, the wonder and the exhilaration are guaranteed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06eb442f9456b2c8c0723a1dae05aefb96d7d6f1/0_140_5146_3088/master/5146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca307290532a8e054d77403d8dd97999","title":"libra facebook visa mastercard paypal ebay","story":"Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and eBay have withdrawn as sponsors – and it may face regulatory problemsPlans for Facebook’s proposed “stablecoin”, Libra, appear to be unravelling with the withdrawal of PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, eBay and Mercado Pago as potential sponsors. This is hardly surprising, given growing awareness of Libra’s potential adverse consequences. If it offers anonymity to its users, Libra will become a platform for tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist finance. If, on the other hand, its privacy protections are lax, Libra will give Facebook access to users’ most intimate financial details.Then there are the dangers Libra poses to economic and financial stability. Although Facebook’s stablecoin will be backed by a portfolio of “low-volatility assets”, anyone who lived through the 2008 global financial crisis will know that low volatility is more a state of mind than an intrinsic attribute of an asset. If the prices of the bonds in the reserve portfolio fall in response to an unexpected rise in interest rates, for example, those bonds may then be inadequate to redeem all the Libra in circulation. At this point, the reserve will be subject to the equivalent of a bank run. And because Libra operates like a currency board, there will be no lender of last resort.Libra may also undercut the stabilising capacity of monetary and regulatory policies. If the residents of a country shift out of its national currency, the central bank’s interest-rate-setting policies will be vitiated. To appreciate the consequences, one need look no further than Argentina’s long, unhappy history of financial dollarisation.Finally, governments that use controls to regulate capital flows will find that they are more easily evaded. Their economies will be fully exposed to the foibles of global financial markets. This will be “disruption” with a vengeance.Libra’s rollout will require the approval of regulators. Its promoters, claiming significant social benefits, argue that it deserves to be approved. Libra will lower the cost of cross-border payments. It will reduce the expense of remittances. It will provide financial services to the unbanked masses.While these arguments for Libra are not false, they are superfluous. The cost of cross-border payments is already falling. Ripple, a San Francisco-based company, uses distributed-ledger technology and a proprietary cryptocurrency to facilitate transfers between commercial banks at a small fraction of their earlier cost.Because Ripple cooperates with commercial banks subject to know-your-customer rules and other regulatory requirements, its payments technology doesn’t pose the same problems as Libra. Banks such as Santander already use this technology to connect Europe with the United States. They are poised to connect the US with Latin America.The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift), through which interbank transfers are traditionally made, is not taking this challenge lying down. It has tested a system, “Swift gpi Instant”, for transferring funds between banks in North America, Europe and Asia, settling payments in as little as 13 seconds.Swift gpi Instant piggybacks on newly installed nonstop instant payment systems such as Singapore’s Fast and Secure Transfers (Fast) and the European Central Bank’s Target Instant Payment Settlement (Tips). Once the Federal Reserve implements a round-the-clock real-time payment and settlement system in 2023 or 2024, this network will be further enhanced.While Swift’s pilot doesn’t rely on distributed-ledger technology, which verifies transactions by recording their details in multiple places at the same time, other initiatives do. For example, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been exploring use of this technology in domestic and cross-border payments in their “Project Stella” (not to be confused with the video game of the same name).Moreover, there is already considerable progress in solving the problem of serving the unbanked courtesy of telecom-based services like M-Pesa, which originated in Kenya but is now used from Afghanistan to Albania. Users need only a cellphone and a contract with their telecom-services provider, not even a bank account. They can then top up their balance at the corner store, protect it with a pin, and use it to make payments to anyone with an account.Platforms such as M-Pesa are being used not just for payments but also to provide other financial services, such as micro-loans. In other words, they already trump Libra when it comes to banking the unbanked.Criticisms of such services focus on their cost. In countries where the dominant telecom company faces little competition, it can insist on high margins. Here, it would seem, is where Libra could have disruptive, pro-competitive effects.But this is wishful thinking. The reality is that the same telecoms that successfully lobby against entry into their own industry will lobby against regulatory authorisation for Libra.Where the problem for economies and financial services is lack of competition, residents of developing countries need to look to their own regulators and politicians. The remedy for their woes is not going to come from Mark Zuckerberg.• Barry Eichengreen is professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former senior policy adviser at the IMF."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25abce4cdfd84799f4b9e30db3106f8105d656dc/0_142_4626_2776/master/4626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=619298e63916696e06425700dcf4fbc0","title":"send tip winter festival europe win 200 pounds hotel voucher","story":"Spectacular light shows, parades, fireworks, food and drink bacchanals, art shows, carnivals … tell us about the best winter event you’ve experienced on your travelsAs the clocks go back and evening skies darken, outdoor events take on a special atmosphere, whether they are on city streets, up mountains or in forests.

The 22-year-old was on his way to California, set to start a PhD program at Stanford University.After wishing everyone goodbye, Aghajohari rolled his suitcases into the terminal. He handed his passport to a Turkish Airlines officer and placed his luggage on a scale. A moment later, a senior airline official pulled Aghajohari aside and showed him an email, which said it was “strictly advised” Aghajohari not board the flight. The initials of US Customs and Border Protection were written beneath the message. “In a few seconds,” Aghajohari said, “I went from being a Stanford student to being seen as a potentially dangerous person.”Aghajohari was one of about 20 students from Iran who were barred from boarding flights to start graduate programs in the United States last month, the majority at campuses in the University of California system. The students were all traveling with valid F-1 student visas issued by the US state department. Most of them were turned away at airports in Iran, while a few were prevented from boarding connecting flights out of Doha and Istanbul. Their cases made headlines around the world.Since then, the students have been trying to figure out what sparked the last-minute denials, and are reckoning with the financial and psychological toll of being suddenly barred from traveling.The Trump administration’s travel ban, which bars Iranians and nationals of six other countries from traveling to the US, does not apply to Iranian students, an exception that factored into the US supreme court’s decision to uphold the ban. In the 2017-18 academic year, more than 12,000 Iranians attended US colleges.Before packing their bags for the US last month, the Iranian students had completed expensive and time-consuming university applications and visa processing. When they were turned away, they rushed to book embassy appointments to find out the reason for the sudden denial. There is no US embassy in Iran, so most of them traveled to Yerevan, Armenia, for appointments, some returning to Tehran by bus – a 24-hour journey – because they could only afford one-way plane tickets.At the embassy, consular officers told the students their visas were revoked. Several students said the officers seemed puzzled by their cases. Most of the students applied for new visas on the spot, filling out the same forms and answering the same questions they had been asked several months earlier.Eighteen students found each other online. The first thing they discovered was that, even though most of them were issued visas in June or July, their cases were all updated in the state department’s online tracking system between 27 and 31 August, a few days before the first student’s flight was scheduled. At the time, the students received no email or alert, and the visa statuses on the site remained “issued”. In hindsight, it seemed like more than a coincidence that their cases were updated – all at once – just before the airport denials began in early September.While the state department says a visa does not guarantee entry to the US, immigration experts said what happened to the students is unusual. “You can’t issue F-1 visas and then just summarily cancel them without providing an explanation,” said Paris Etemadi Scott, an attorney at the Pars Equality Center in California.What resembles an unwritten extension of the travel ban slammed the doors on students amid escalating tensions between the US and Iran. Lawyers and students wondered if the sudden denials were an act of political retaliation. “I can only speculate that the reason may have more to do with the deteriorating state of US-Iran relations than with anything in the students’ backgrounds,” said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a law professor at Cornell University.Over the past month, universities and advocacy organizations have demanded explanations from the US government. At a meeting last week, state department officials at the US visa office in Washington DC told representatives of the American Immigration Lawyers Association they were “not aware of the situation at all”, according to the AILA government relations director, Sharvari Dalal-Dheini.In the absence of an explanation, lawyers said the mass denials are a betrayal of regulations laid out in the travel ban. “They claim they are exempting students and then they revoke the visas,” said Dr Leila Golestaneh Austin, the executive director of the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans. “It goes against what they promised.”When Katie Porter, a California Democratic congresswoman, inquired with the US embassy in Yerevan and got an auto-response the students were all familiar with – “We do not have any information to share about your visa status” – they began to laugh in despair. “If they are going to answer to the congresswoman like that,” said Mohammadali, a student admitted to UC Irvine, “we know there will be no help for us.”A spokesperson for the state department told the  the department does not discuss the details of inidual cases. “Visa applicants are continuously screened, both at the time of their application and afterwards,” the spokesperson said.The last-minute denials have had a deep, possibly lasting effect on a group of Iran’s highest-achieving students. In interviews with eight students, they detailed financial losses, career setbacks, lack of housing, illness, stress and anxiety in the weeks following the abrupt cancellations.“We invested our lives,” said Nima Abdollahpour, who was set to start a PhD at UC Davis. To gain admission to their programs, the students took costly exams to prove their English fluency and academic abilities, and devoted time and money to applying all over the world. Nearly all of them did so knowing they could only afford to enroll in programs that offered them research or teaching assistant positions that would fully fund their studies.Most of the students are graduates of Sharif University of Technology, Iran’s most prestigious college, which produces some of the world’s leading mathematicians and scientists. Last year, Aghajohari was the top computer engineering student at SUT another student, admitted to UC Santa Cruz, ranked third out of more than 200,000 students in Iran’s nationwide university entrance exam.After gaining admission, Iranian students go through a demanding visa application process. First, they travel to Ankara or Yerevan to interview for their visas. The applications then go through an extensive vetting process that has reduced the number of approvals in the last two years and lengthened processing times.Should their visa applications be successful, Iranians – unlike other students – are typically granted single-entry visas, meaning they must remain in the US for the duration of their academic program while their family members in Iran are banned from visiting them.When their visas were issued, the students thought they had finally made it. “I thought that was the end,” said S, a 23-year-old admitted to UC Irvine. She turned down offers she had received from programs in Canada and Europe and began making preparations to move to America.S spent $2,500 on plane tickets, university applications and visa fees. Then she paid rent in Irvine for two months, bought furniture online, registered for several scientific symposiums this fall, and paid Qatar Airways for non-refundable excess baggage. S’s sibling, who lives on the east coast of the US, bought a plane ticket to go surprise her in Irvine.The financial losses are compounded by the dramatic fall of the Iranian rial over the last six years, largely as a result of US sanctions. Since 2013, the cost of the US dollar against the rial has more than tripled. Students estimated the price of flying from Tehran to Yerevan – about $100 – is equal to a month’s wages.After graduating from the University of Tehran, Mehran, 24, co-founded an award-winning software company that employs more than 20 people. He had a good life in Tehran, but wanted to pursue a PhD at a top research university in order to improve his company and to give himself the option of starting a teaching career in Iran.Mehran was not the only student to describe physical and psychological symptoms after being blocked from traveling to start his studies. After she was turned away at the Tehran airport, S stayed in bed for days, crying from stress for hours at a time. Nearly a month later, she is still avoiding people. She doesn’t want to keep explaining what happened or be seen as “‘that person’ who has failed in something”. Last month, she started taking anxiety medication for the first time.Other students said certain moments have crystallized in their memories. Aghajohari, who was brimming with optimism as he departed for Stanford, recalled the world turning on him the second he was denied at the check-in counter. “Every passenger was looking at me like I was a criminal,” he said. “It is really hard for me to forget that moment.”While the students continue to wait for answers, fall quarter classes have started without them. Mehran, Abdollahpour, Aghajohari, and S are all staying with their parents in different parts of Iran. Aghajohari spends his days taking his grandmother to chemotherapy appointments and reading novels to get his mind off the visa problems, whenever possible. “Most of the time at home is spent talking about this issue,” he said. “My parents are very worried about it.”The students hope to be in California when the winter quarter begins in January, but are finding it hard to trust the process. Several are looking into programs in other countries. “We had a lot of dreams about our future,” Abdollahpour said. “Now I think they might not happen.”• Some of the students asked to be identified by their first name or initial out of concern for their pending visa applications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0163a30749044afb1889d2d51de43600d110bcdc/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=246ec6701121206efb0a48bec9c80e01","title":"economics nobel prize abhijit banerjee esther duflo michael kremer","story":"Academics who pioneered on-the-ground experiments to discover the most effective ways to tackle poverty in the developing world have been awarded this year’s Nobel prize for economics.Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, of the Massachusetts Institute for Technology, secured the 9m Swedish krona (£720,000) prize with the Harvard professor Michael Kremer on Monday.The Swedish academy of sciences said they were awarded the Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences, given in memory of Alfred Nobel, for research findings that have “dramatically improved our ability to fight poverty in practice”.Duflo, 46, who is only the second woman to win the economics prize and the youngest in the prize’s 50-year history, said she was surprised by the award, especially as it was usually bestowed on older, more experienced academics.Asked if it was important that a woman was recognised by the academy, she said: “Showing that it is possible for a woman to succeed and be recognised for success I hope is going to inspire many, many other women to continue working and many other men to give them the respect they deserve.”Duflo, who has travelled widely in developing countries testing out how best to alleviate poverty, is already well-known on the economics circuit after winning the 2010 John Bates Clark Medal, which singles out economists under 40 that have made “the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge”. The academy said the winners had shown there was a need to adopt new approaches in the fight against poverty that were based on field trials rather than prejudice or the failed methods of the past.Giving one example, the academy said: “As a result of one of their studies, more than 5 million Indian children have benefitted from programmes of remedial tutoring in schools.”With 700 million people still living in extreme poverty and many children leaving school without a basic education, the academy said it was important that studies identified the causes of poverty to draw conclusions about the causal effects and implement policies that were cost effective.“Their experimental research methods now entirely dominate development economics,” the academy said.Duflo worked with Kolkata-born Banerjee, her husband, following up experiments by Kremer, which the academy said the couple “broadened and deepened”.Duflo said their work was devoted to making sure “the fight against poverty is based on scientific evidence”.She said: “Poor people are supposed to be either completely stupid, desperate, lazy or entrepreneurial. But we don’t try to understand the deep root, the interconnected root of the problem.“So what we try to do in our work is unpack the problems one by one to better understand the reasons for particular problems. What works, what doesn’t work and why.”Much of the work produced by the trio was until recently overseen by Kremer’s wife, Rachel Glennerster, who as the director of the Boston-based Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) coordinated research by 181 affiliated professors at universities around the world before taking leave last year to become the chief economist at the Department for International Development.In 2016 Kremer and Glennerster argued in their book Strong Medicine: Creating Incentives for Pharmaceutical Research on Neglected Diseases that more vaccines would be available to poor countries if sales were guaranteed by funding agencies. Data compiler Clarivate Analytics, which ranks academics by the number of citations they have gathered throughout their careers, said the most cited this year were Ariel Rubinstein, who teaches game theory at Tel Aviv University and New York University William Brian Arthur for his research on technological advances and Katarina Juselius and Søren Johansen, economics professors at the University of Copenhagen, for contributions to econometrics.Last year, William Nordhaus of Yale University and Paul Romer at New York University were honoured for their research into two of the most “basic and pressing” economic issues of the age.Nordhaus for warning policymakers about climate change in the 1970s and Romer for promoting government support for research and development, and investment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20801c1b356c6e9af0a48e72d1f0e2dcbbf89719/0_0_4131_2479/master/4131.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aef283105bef6fb2b5a07affbc17ca66","title":"rights groups urge cyprus to drop false case against briton","story":"Woman, 19, says police pressure led her to retract claim of rape by 12 Israeli tourists in hotelHuman rights and feminist groups are calling for Cypriot authorities to drop the case against a British teenager accused of falsely claiming she was raped by 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room.The 19-year-old, who reported the alleged assault almost three months ago but was then arrested after revoking her criminal complaint, is due to go on trial on Tuesday on a charge of public mischief. She has pleaded not guilty to fabricating the accusation of rape, but could be imprisoned for up to a year if found guilty.Forced to relinquish her passport and remain in Nicosia, the island’s capital, she has already spent a month in detention, sharing a cramped cell with nine other women.A growing number of human rights organisations are demanding her release.“It’s brutal what she and her family have had to endure,” said Susana Pavlou, the director of the Nicosia-based Mediterranean Institute of Gender Studies. “It is totally disproportionate to what she is accused of.”The NGO is among 11 organisations that last week urged Cyprus’s attorney general, Costas Clerides, to dismiss the case, which is being watched as closely there as it is in Israel and the UK.The student – who cannot be publicly identified – says she retracted the rape claims under duress during prolonged police interrogation. A confession, retracting her initial accusation of assault in the resort town of Ayia Napa, was signed at 2am after eight hours of questioning, according to her lawyers. They have been highly critical of the fact that a lawyer was not present.The same day, the Briton’s alleged assailants were released from custody and allowed to return home. Most were 18 although at least two were 15.Michael Pollak, a barrister with the legal aid group Justice Abroad, which is spearheading a four-strong team defending the Briton, said it was evident she had post-traumatic stress disorder – brought on by her change of status from victim to suspect – and was susceptible to pressure.He added: “It’s quite clear police in Cyprus were under immense pressure to deal with the matter quickly, that no one wanted rape claims hovering over Ayia Napa, which after all depends on young tourists.”Last week, police denied any mishandling of the case. “We have treated this affair with utmost sensitivity and seriousness,” said the force’s chief spokesman, Christos Andreou.Cyprus’s economy is heavily reliant on tourism. The ided island’s Greek-administered south is keen to expand already warm ties with Israel. The east Mediterranean nations are linked by security and energy ties that officials consider to be strategic and politically sensitive.Local NGOs echo the argument of the woman’s defence lawyers that police mishandled the inquiry.“From the outset she had no access to basic rights as foreseen under domestic and EU law,” said Pavlou, adding that in a patriarchal society such as Cyprus the case had highlighted a lack of protocol by authorities in rape complaints.“For three days she had no mental health support. We have asked the attorney general to intervene because we want to put an end to her re-victimisation and this constant media exposure, which can only be traumatic. What we have seen has amounted to cannibalism. It is hugely troubling.”The trial is set to last at least three days. If convicted, the Briton’s defence team say they will take the case to the European court of human rights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd3b105deef25255fdde95925268859537a3057b/155_0_3189_1913/master/3189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfa1c71735563d4ba5eb7676e348a022","title":"the aftermath of typhoon hagibis in pictures","story":"Japan’s Typhoon Hagibis made landfall south of Tokyo on Saturday evening with heavy rain, which flooded the city and surrounding areas.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, last Tuesday. Photograph: Stephanie LecocqAFPGetty Images.Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said a Brexit deal is still possible this week, despite the DUP hardening its opposition to a potential solution to the deadlock over the weekend.Speaking on Monday morning, Mr Coveney said: “A deal is possible, and it’s possible this month, may even be possible this week. But we’re not there yet.”“The message I would give is that we need to be cautious, this is not an easy job, we spent three years trying to get an agreement between the two sides that have made progress at different times, but certainly the last number of months have been difficult,” Mr Coveney said.UK prime minister Boris Johnson is coming under pressure to concede more ground to Brussels as UK and EU officials will resume talks in the Belgian capital on Monday.Time is rapidly running out if there is to be an agreement to put to EU leaders to sign off on at their two-day summit starting on Thursday.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said “technical-level” talks between officials over the weekend had proved “constructive”.But in a briefing to ambassadors of the remaining EU27 on Sunday in Brussels, he said that “a lot of work remains to be done”.The BBC reported that the UK has dropped a demand that the deal should include a veto for the Stormont Assembly. However, DUP MP Jim Shannon this weekend added his voice to opposition to the proposed compromise involving Northern Ireland remaining legally part of the UK customs union but in practice operating as an EU customs territory.Mr Shannon said the proposed “double customs” solution would not work because it would treat Northern Ireland “differently” to Britain.“It is simple. Are we being treated the same as England? No, we are not. Therefore, if we are not being treated the same as England, then we are not going to accept it,” he said.Sticking pointEarlier, Mr Johnson told senior ministers that, while a “pathway” to a deal could still be seen, there was “still a significant amount of work to get there”.In a cabinet conference call, he said they still had to be prepared to leave on Halloween without a deal.The sticking point remains the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop intended to guarantee there is no return of a hard Border with the Republic.Mr Barnier was reported to have raised concern about the complexity of a British plan to keep Northern Ireland in the UK customs territory while avoiding the need for border controls.There were reported doubts about the feasibility of the scheme which was said to involve tracking goods as they move through Northern Ireland and then determining the tariff to be paid depending where they end up.It raised the prospect that negotiations could carry on after this week, with the possibility of an emergency EU summit at the end of the month to finally approve any 11th hour agreement.However if Mr Johnson cannot get a deal by the weekend, he will come under intense pressure to seek a further Brexit delay, something he has vowed not to do.Labour however has warned that if necessary it will take action through the courts to force him to comply with the so-called Benn Act which requires to request an extension.Either way, the stage is set for a major Commons showdown when the prime minister returns to Westminster for an emergency Saturday sitting of parliament, the first in 37 years.If he cannot get a deal, he is widely expected to blame MPs for cutting the ground from under him, laying the ground for a “people versus Parliament” general election.If he is able to get an agreement, UK government sources have said they will seek to rush through legislation to ratify it in time for the promised Halloween withdrawal date.Some opposition MPs have signalled they could support an agreement if there was a requirement to put it to the public in a confirmatory referendum.However, UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn indicated he had little enthusiasm for the idea.“I think many in Parliament, not necessarily Labour MPs but others, might be more inclined to support it (if there was a referendum) even if they don’t really agree with the deal. But I would caution them,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: NIck BradshawA referendum to give voting rights to Irish citizens living outside the State in presidential elections is now unlikely to take place until the new year.The Bill to amend the Constitution was published last month, and a Referendum Commission established, but several Government sources said the referendum campaign would not go ahead while delicate Brexit negotiations were ongoing.The referendum, which would, if passed, allow Irish citizens living abroad to vote in presidential elections from 2025, was originally earmarked for a polling date in May – at the same time as the local and European elections – but was then rescheduled for late October or early November.That would have required the legislation to have been published before the summer recess to ensure a Referendum Commission was established sufficiently in advance of polling day.However, in Cabinet meetings during July, several Ministers expressed reservations about the referendum going ahead in the autumn, arguing that it would ert public attention away from Brexit in the run-up to the October 31st deadline.The referendum is likely to encounter a higher degree of opposition than the recent ones on orce and on blasphemy. Some high-profile figures are expected to oppose allowing citizens who do not live in Ireland the right to vote in elections that might not have a direct impact on them.Complex campaignIn February, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil the campaign could turn out to be be complex and if the Government was to succeed with it, it would need to put in a “good campaign”.The 39th Amendment of the Constitution (Presidential Elections) Bill was published on September 16th by Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.A fortnight ago the Tánaiste announced the establishment of the Referendum Commission chaired by High Court judge David Barniville.Mr Coveney has said that with the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, that process has been prioritised over choosing a specific date for the referendum.The Bill to amend the Constitution is expected to come before the Dáil during this term. Once passed by parliament and enacted, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will make an order for polling. The referendum must take place 30-90 days after the making of the order.The four by-elections to replace the four former TDs who were elected to the European parliament are scheduled to take place on November 29th. In order for the referendum to take place on that day, the order would need to be made by October 30th.Several sources in Government said on Thursday they thought this highly unlikely and predicted a polling date in spring."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: Donald Trump has empowered all of the most heinous anti-Western forces in the Middle EastDrugs investigators close in on Asian \u0026#39El Chapo\u0026#39 at centre of vast meth ringWhat is a Queen\u0026#39s speech and what happens if Boris Johnson loses the vote?Queen\u0026#39s Speech 2019: Monarch says Britain will leave on Oct 31 - plus all the other key points Brexit latest news: Jacob Rees-Mogg claims EU law could get around the Benn Act, as Parliament debates Queen\u0026#39s SpeechComment: Scrapping useless rail franchises makes sense – it\u0026#39s already making fares cheaper and passengers happier Comment: Boris Johnson can only make this Queen\u0026#39s Speech a reality by breaking the Brexit impasseMonday afternoon news briefing: Queen says Brexit on October 31 is a \u0026#39priority\u0026#39 in State Opening of ParliamentComment: Why should Boris kowtow to biased BBC presenters who say that he\u0026#39s a \u0026#39dictator\u0026#39?\tAs October 31 looms ever closer, what next for Brexit?

However, it seems likely that Russia will broker a broader agreement to avoid a clash between Turkey and the Assad regime.  Syrian regime forces are pictured as they patrol a street on the western entrance of the town of Tal Tamr in the countryside of Syria\u0026#39s northeastern Hasakeh province on October 14, 2019It is not clear if Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies will continue advancing into Syria now that Assad\u0027s soldiers have entered the area. The Pentagon said on Sunday that it was withdrawing all 1,000 American forces from northern Syria. But US media reported the Trump administration was preparing to pull its troops out of the country entirely, with the exception of small garrison in the southern town of al-Tanf to deter Iran.If the US does mount a fullscale withdrawal it will also force the retreat of British and French special forces, who are dependent on American support to continue operating inside Syria. Meanwhile, Mr Trump signalled on Sunday night that would give into pressure from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress to impose sanctions on Turkey as punishment for the offensive against the Kurds.Mr Trump said he was speaking to Lindsey Graham, a hawkish Republican senator and avowed Erdoğan critic, about “about imposing powerful sanctions on Turkey”.Mr Graham has laid out a plan that would sanction Mr Erdoğan’s personal assets and those Turkey’s foreign and defence minister, as well as blocking arms sales and military equipment to Turkey.  It is not clear if Mr Trump has agreed to those sanctions specifically but if the final policy is even close to Mr Graham’s proposal it will infuriate Turkey and could lead to the cancellation of Mr Erdoğan’s scheduled visit to Washington next month. Mr Trump has so far show little appetite for sanctioning Turkey but he faces little choice but to go along with sanctions that have overwhelming support in Congress. A Western diplomat said the White House believes Congress would override any effort by Mr Trump to veto the sanctions. The situation in northeast Syria collapsed into chaos so quickly that US special forces did not have time to execute a plan to seize around 60 of the top Isil fighters in Kurdish custody, according to the New York Times. US commandos planned to take the prisoners from the Kurds and move them to Iraq but were unable to as the roads of northeast Syria were flooded with refugees and military vehicles while Turkish airstrikes rained down. It is not known if any British fighters were among the 60 men on the US list. America has already taken custody of Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, the two surviving members of the “Beatles” group of of alleged British torturers.     Meanwhile, Tooba Gondal, a 25-year-old who went to Syria and is alleged to have recruited other British women into Isil, became the first known UK member of the jihadist group to escape.Ms Gondal was among around 800 women and children who broke free from a Kurdish camp in Ain Issa on Sunday when Turkish shells fell nearby. She texted family in the UK “I am free” and told them she was sleeping on the street of a nearby with her children, according to ITV.Several other British women are believed to have escaped from the camp. All face a deeply uncertain fate as Assad’s forces take control of the area. Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson will not resign if his Queen\u0026#39s Speech is voted down by MPsComment: Donald Trump has empowered all of the most heinous anti-Western forces in the Middle EastDrugs investigators close in on Asian \u0026#39El Chapo\u0026#39 at centre of vast meth ringWhat is a Queen\u0026#39s speech and what happens if Boris Johnson loses the vote?Queen\u0026#39s Speech 2019: Monarch says Britain will leave on Oct 31 - plus all the other key points Comment: Scrapping useless rail franchises makes sense – it\u0026#39s already making fares cheaper and passengers happier Comment: Boris Johnson can only make this Queen\u0026#39s Speech a reality by breaking the Brexit impasseMonday afternoon news briefing: Queen says Brexit on October 31 is a \u0026#39priority\u0026#39 in State Opening of ParliamentComment: Why should Boris kowtow to biased BBC presenters who say that he\u0026#39s a \u0026#39dictator\u0026#39?\tAs October 31 looms ever closer, what next for Brexit?

All cheese production must take place in the town of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, where the cheese has been made in the same vein for 1,000 years.While family producers still exist, around 70 per cent of genuine roquefort made according to “protected designation of origin”, or PDO, rules is produced by Société des Caves, a brand owned by the world’s biggest dairy group, Lactalis.Société recently launched a cheese called bleu de brebis (Ewes’ Blue) which uses pasteurised milk, is cheaper and milder in taste. It sports the same brand name and the green packaging is very similar to the original.Roquefort sheep rearers must leave their ewes to graze freely as part of the appellation rulesUnionists at the producer complain it is shooting itself in the foot by launching the new cheese, as it will push down sales of roquefort that have already dropped 16 per cent in a decade to six million wheels.Last month, they teamed up with “yellow vest” protesters to storm a supermarket in Millau selling the new blue-veined rival, forcing the manager to remove it from his shelves.Société argues it is simply catering to changing tastes. “Roquefort no longer fits the requirements of some consumers who want a milder product,” Societé’s director general Christian Gentil told Les Echos. “So we have brought out bleu de brebis, which is not a roquefort ersatz and is made with local milk as indicated on the packet.”However, INAO, the French body that defines cheese-making rules, recently issued a warning that Société risked misleading consumers with “false or fallacious” marketing given that it is “historically, legally and commercially” linked to roquefort.But with no ruling expected until next year, the plight of true roquefort has been taken up by José Bové - a farmer and Green MEP famed for having trashed a MacDonald’s to protest against “crap food” and US restrictions on importing roquefort.Dismissing bleu de brebis as “Canada Dry” roquefort, he announced his intention to take the fight to court. “For me, there is only one solution to this crisis: a ban and an end to production of this blue cheese,” he told Libération.Roquefort is by no means the only French fromage under attack from pasteurised rivals.Defenders of “real” camembert have been fighting a long-running battle to protect the gooey cheese made with raw milk from similar-sounding pasteurised interlopers. INAO is due to rule on new labels differentiating the two next month.Bleu de brebis is not the only reason for roquefort to be cheesed off. Sheep farmers in the area have issued increasingly plaintive warnings that their flocks face attacks from wolves, long eradicated from the area.However, there could be one silver lining for the blue cheese while British stilton and cheddar face retaliatory tariffs as part of Donald Trump’s ongoing battle with the European Union over aircraft subsidies, roquefort is apparently not on the list.That prompted Reuters\u0027 Michel Rose to ask: “Is there a Roquefort aficionado in the Trump administration? Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson will not resign if his Queen\u0026#39s Speech is voted down by MPsComment: Donald Trump has empowered all of the most heinous anti-Western forces in the Middle EastDrugs investigators close in on Asian \u0026#39El Chapo\u0026#39 at centre of vast meth ringWhat is a Queen\u0026#39s speech and what happens if Boris Johnson loses the vote?Queen\u0026#39s Speech 2019: Monarch says Britain will leave on Oct 31 - plus all the other key points Comment: Scrapping useless rail franchises makes sense – it\u0026#39s already making fares cheaper and passengers happier Comment: Boris Johnson can only make this Queen\u0026#39s Speech a reality by breaking the Brexit impasseMonday afternoon news briefing: Queen says Brexit on October 31 is a \u0026#39priority\u0026#39 in State Opening of ParliamentComment: Why should Boris kowtow to biased BBC presenters who say that he\u0026#39s a \u0026#39dictator\u0026#39?\tAs October 31 looms ever closer, what next for Brexit?

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureBut Mr Bennett tweeted: “This is pretty standard for many schools. And it’s fine, as *part*\u0026nbspof a range of strategies,\u0026nbspthat includes normative messaging, routines, targeted support\u0026nbspetc.”The row comes after the National Education Union (NEU) described “zero-tolerance” behaviour policies in schools as “inhumane” and “damaging to pupil mental health” at their conference in April.On the school’s guide, Debra Kidd,\u0026nbspeducation consultant and former teacher, tweeted: “They don’t need this draconian approach that’s for sure. No wonder we’re seeing mental health and violence rocket in our young.“We’re putting them in a pressure cooker and then blaming them for exploding.”However, some teachers backed the tough approach, arguing\u0026nbspit would make their jobs\u0026nbspeasier.\u0026nbspOne English teacher\u0026nbsptweeted: “I have six back-to-back difficult classes tomorrow and if I was going to work in a school that actually enforced this I would probably get a full eight hours\u0027 sleep tonight and not wake up at 5am filled with anxiety.”In May, the Department for Education announced a £10m crackdown on bad behaviour in schools, led by Mr Bennett. The taskforce will advise schools on detention systems and pupil attendance.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By sharing details of the phone, the technology giant was attempting to take back the narrative from the leakers, gossips and rumour merchants that fill the pages of the tech press in the build-up to a major product launch.But the limited amount of information imparted only seemed to serve as bait, with publications picking apart each picture\u0026nbspto determine what hardware features to expect. Along with dual-rear cameras, the images also revealed an additional sensor that became noticeable when the contrast of one image was adjusted.Moreover, Google\u0027s revelations didn\u0027t prevent the usual slew of rumours, with Google and its production partners seemingly more leaky than dear Liza\u0027s bucket.The official unveiling of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL will take place on 15 October at an event in New York City, but with little left to announce it will likely be almost entirely ceremonial. For those not keen on sitting through a two hour presentation, The Independent\u0026nbsphas a run down of everything that\u0027s expected to be announced.As with most smartphone makers this year, the main upgrade for Google\u0027s latest device will almost certainly be the camera.Both the front- and rear-facing cameras will see considerable improvements, with an additional 16-megapixel telephoto lens at the back being complimented by complex sensors at the front that will enable the same depth-aware facial recognition that is featured on the latest\u0026nbspiPhones.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

A camera block at the back is reminiscent of the iPhone 11\u0027s setup and houses both lenses and sensors.Leaked photos also seem to show that there is no longer a fingerprint reader on the rear of the device, though this may still be featured beneath the screen itself.There will three colours for the Pixel 4: \u0027just black\u0027, \u0027clearly white\u0027 and \u0027oh so orange\u0027. There may also be a \u0027mint green\u0027 version of the phone, though this is not certain.Android 10 and a 5G versionGoogle\u0027s latest mobile operating system was announced in August,\u0026nbsprevealing a complete overhaul to the world\u0027s most popular software. As always, Google\u0027s own devices were the first to include Android 10 and so there is no doubt it will appear on the two new Pixel 4 phones.One of the most highly-anticipated features of Android 10 is Live Caption, which uses artificial intelligence to automatically transcribe speech from audio or videos playing on the phone.AFPGetty Images)Whilst fundamentally an accessibility feature, allowing deaf and hard-of-hearing users to better consume content, it will also be a perk to anyone hoping to surreptitiously watch videos without disturbing those around them.Google is also reportedly working on a 5G version of the Pixel 4, according to Nikkei Asian Review, which would see the tech giant beat its old foe Apple to releasing a next-generation device.Release date and priceWhile the date of the announcement is already known, it is not clear yet when the phones will actually be released. If past Pixel cycles are anything to go by, pre-orders will open the day of the unveiling, with the release date coming before the end of the month.Last year, the Pixel 3 was revealed on 9 October and released nine days later on 18 October.No amount of leaks have given a certain indication of the exact price of the new phones, though listings discovered by 9to5Google\u0026nbspsuggest the Pixel 4 will cost 820 euros (£727) and the Pixel 4 XL will be 1,127 euros (£999).Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Another Wellcome Images Award winner, this time of baby Hawaiian bobtail squid.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores.

But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. The autobiography is co-written by Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton Hamilton.Home Work: A Memoir of My Hollywood Years is out on Tuesday.the sound of music\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspSound of Music\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On Monday, shadow voting minister Cat Smith claimed the announcement was a “blatant attempt by the Tories to rig the result of the next general election”.Voter ID, intended to “tackle electoral fraud and protect our democracy”,\u0026nbspis among a number of electoral changes the government is seeking to introduce. Under the scheme, anyone who does not have photographic ID will be able to apply for a free document proving their identity.But Darren Hughes, of the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), said\u0026nbsp“these plans will leave tens of thousands of legitimate voters voiceless”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Queen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureIn a statement, he said: “Ministers should focus on combating the real threats to our democracy, rather than suppressing voters’ rights.“When millions of people lack photo ID, these mooted plans risk raising the drawbridge to huge numbers of marginalised voters,\u0026nbspincluding many elderly and black and minority ethnic voters.”On Twitter, the ERS called the voter ID “dangerous and undemocratic”.Another campaigner, Clare Collier\u0026nbspfrom the Liberty charity, claimed that “the government has grossly inflated the risk of electoral fraud as an excuse to usher in ever-greater surveillance”.And Toby James, head of politics at the University of East Anglia, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat “electoral fraud, or suspicions of electoral fraud, are exceptionally rare”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by email“There is no evidence, really, to justify the introduction of voter ID requirements,” Professor James added. “The problems are elsewhere. There’s a very significant risk that this is going to lead to people not being able to vote.”Johnson Brexit policies ‘risk retaliatory deportations’ for Britons living in EUIn trials of such schemes, people have refused on principle to hand over their driving licence or passport,\u0026nbspdisplaying a “philosophical resistance” to the idea, Prof James said.The director of Age UK, Caroline Abrahams, said Mr Johnson’s move towards voter ID was “crazy”. In a statement, she told The Independent:\u0026nbsp“Many older people do not have any photographic ID so we sincerely hope the government is not going to legislate so this becomes a requirement before anyone is allowed to vote.“It would risk disenfranchising millions of older people, among others, and so on the face of it seems a crazy idea to propose.”In a report from December 2015 the independent Electoral Commission said that about 3.5 million electors did not have an acceptable form of photo ID. Nonetheless, the regulator backed a voter ID scheme.In 2017, a University of California study found that strict\u0026nbspvoter ID laws in the US tended to “skew democracy in favour of whites and those on the political right”. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, called the Conservative plans “such an obvious US voter suppression move”, while Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: “The people the Tories are trying to stop voting will be disproportionately poor and from ethnic minority backgrounds.”A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said:\u0026nbsp”Electoral fraud is an unacceptable crime that strikes at a core principle of our democracy.“Showing ID to vote is a reasonable and proportionate way to protect our elections – it is something people already do in everyday life and voters in Northern Ireland have been doing it with ease for decades.“Voter ID is one part of a body of work this Government is delivering to give the public confidence that our elections are secure and fit for the 21st century.”In a briefing note circulated in advance of the Queen’s Speech, the government said its move was based on a 2016 review of elections by Eric Pickles.The Independent\u0026nbspunderstands the rules will be introduced by way of primary legislation with a view to passing a bill before the next scheduled general election in 2022.Queen’s Speech ignores Brexit to kick off a Tory election campaignIn additional plans introduced\u0026nbspon Monday, campaigners are to be banned from handling postal votes and a limit imposed on how many postal votes one person can hand in. Postal voters will be required to re-register every three years.People will only be allowed to vote by proxy for two other electors at most, regardless of their relationship, while ministers will also try to make voting easier for people with disabilities.Meanwhile, an “imprints regime” will be created to police online election material to “make it clearer to the electorate who has produced and promoted” it – following widespread controversy over the use of social media for targeted campaigns.

The payments firms Mercado Pago and Stripe have also pulled out, leaving the project with only one of six payments-related firms who were originally involved.The withdrawals also leave the cryptocurrency project with no major US payment processor.\u0026nbspA spokesperson for eBay said: “eBay has made the decision to not move forward as a founding member. At this time, we are focused on rolling out eBay’s managed payments experience for our customers.”A spokesperson for Visa also left open the potential for a shift, saying, “We will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association’s ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations.”Created with Sketch.How to stop Facebook from revealing everything about you Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.19 Lock your profile downIf you haven’t done this already, do it now.

Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, called for a halt on the project in July.\u0026nbsp“Because Facebook is already in the hands of over a quarter of the world’s population, it is imperative that Facebook and its partners immediately cease implementation plans until regulators and Congress have an opportunity to examine these issues and take action,” she and four other Democrats\u0026nbspwrote in a statement at the time.“During this moratorium, we intend to hold public hearings on the risks and benefits of cryptocurrency-based activities and explore legislative solutions. Failure to cease implementation before we can do so, risks a new Swiss-based financial system that is too big to fail.”Facebook chief executive\u0026nbspMark Zuckerberg will appear before Congress on 23 October to justify Libra and its planned roll-out.His appearance is scheduled a little over a week after the first official meeting of the Libra Association Council, which will take place on 14 October\u0026nbspin Geneva.\u0026nbsp“We look forward to the inaugural Libra Association Council meeting in just three\u0026nbspdays and announcing the initial members of the Libra Association,” said a spokesperson for the Council.David Marcus, Facebook’s lead executive on the Libra project, wrote on Twitter\u0026nbsphe “would caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update.”“Of course, it’s not great news in the short term, but in a way it’s liberating,” the tweets continued. “Stay tuned for more very soon. Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you’re on to something when so much pressure builds up.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

General Mazloum Kobani Abdi, commander of the SDF, described the operation as an “existential threat” to Syria’s Kurds.The agreement could spell the end of a years-long experiment in autonomy led by Syria’s Kurds, and marks a major shift in alliances for the embattled community.Created with Sketch.Turkey launches offensive into Syria Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Turkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehiclesTurkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehiclesTurkey has long threatened to attack the SDF, which it considers a terror organisation for its links to a Kurdish separatist group that has fought the Turkish state for decades. Ankara said its military operation was launched to implement a “safe zone” along its border with Syria, free of SDF fighters.Innocent Syrian civilians being ‘turned into the fuel of war’But the SDF – a mostly Kurdish militia with a smaller Arab contingent –\u0026nbsphas been a key ally of the US in the fight against Isis. The presence of US troops in Syria alongside the group had acted as a deterrence for a Turkish assault. That changed quickly last week when Donald Trump made a shock announcement that the US would not stand in the way of Turkey’s plans to enter Syria. The SDF described the abrupt shift as a “stab in the back”.The deal will see the Syrian army deployed along a large stretch of the Turkey-Syria border, the SDF said, in an effort to deter any further Turkish incursion.The agreement brings its own dangers, however. For decades, Kurds in Syria have faced repression and discrimination at the hands of the government.

Unless you live under a rock, you will have been as gripped as the rest of us by Coleen’s very public suggestion that Rebekah has sold stories about Coleen’s personal le “for a few years now”.“After a long time of trying to ­figure out who it could be,” Coleen wrote on Instagram, “for ious reasons I had a ­suspicion. To try and prove this I came up with an idea.”That meant blocking all of her followers except one on her private Instagram account, then posting fake stories to seethey made it into the papers.“The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about ing to TV and the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house,” she wrote, were all .So when the stories appeared in print, Coleen pounced. “Now I know for certain which account inidual it’s come from. It’s . . . Rebekah Vardy’s account.”Rebekah denies being the ­source of the stories, claiming a string of other people have had access to her Instagram account. Call me old-fashioned, but why didn’t Coleen pick up the phone instead of picking a public fight Coleen assumed this saga would grab the world’s attention. It has, but perhaps not for the reasons she thought.It gives us a real insight into the reality of fame and the ­obsessive paranoia that can go with it.Although she is used to living out her ­personal dramas in the public eye, Coleen has ­forgotten that public spats, especially those waged on social media, never end well.All too often, they reflect badly on BOTH parties. And they can lead to a social media pile-on that seriously affects people’s lives.Rebekah cut short her ­holiday this week and has had to contend with some truly vile trolling about her children and even her unborn baby.Meanwhile, what Coleen has failed to grasp is this: Something is only a secretyou are the only person who knows about it.The moment you share your secrets on social media — even in a “private” group — you risk those secrets escaping into the real world.You know, the real world, where friends meet up for a glass of wine and a long chat, talking about their lives rather than sharing edited highlights via social media.That is what friends are for. I couldn’t survive without my friends and would far rather chat to them than post on social media.If you suspect someone is stealing your secrets and selling them on, wouldn’t any right-thinking person simply cut them out of their le Why bother laying an elaborate trap to catch the culpritthe main objective is to stop it happening and get negative people away from you To me, it feels very teenagerish, the sort of thing you do in school, not when you are a grown woman with four kids.The s Coleen went to ­suggest she has a bit too much time on her hands.Perhaps this is a by-product of an obsession with your privacy — when you want it, that is, and not when you are selling your wedding photos to glossy celebrity magazines.You develop such a high opinion of yourself that you truly believe the world and his we are on ­tenterhooks about the latest minutiae of your domestic le.This story highlights something : The impact fame can have on someone’s ego and their sense of their own importance.  Really, Coleen just needs to get over herself.WE desperately need to do something about one in three primary school kids being dangerously fat – double the rate of  years ago.But banning consumption of all food and drink on public transport – as well as pies at football matches – would be scratching the wrong itch.Isn’t the real answer to educate people about healthy eating and stop companies marketing sugary foods to children  Alongside spending more time and money promoting sport so kids move more and eat less Don’t get me wrong, I object to people eating food on the Tube.

It wasn’t so long ago the EU ruled out EVER re-opening the negotiations and Britain was hurtling towards a No Deal crash. What made the dference  Could it be that our friends in Brussels were riled at the idea of Boris fighting an election while blaming them for Britain not getting out on time Things started to change on Tuesday when a No source briefed details of a call between the PM and Germany’s Angela Merkel. The insider’s memo said their conversation made it clear a deal was “overwhelmingly unlikely”.Bearing all the hallmarks of Boris Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings, it was texted to James Forsyth, Sun columnist and Political Editor of The Spectator. In chilling tones, it raised fears Boris was heading flat out for No Deal.It threatened: “Supporting delay will be seen by this Government as hostile interference in domestic politics. Any delay will be negotiated between you, Parliament and the courts. We will focus on winning the election on a manesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave.”Feathers were ruffled across the Channel — yet within two days Boris and Irish Taoiseach Varadkar agreed to meet then said they could “see a pathway” to Brexit deal. EU Council President Donald Tusk had earlier made clear his anger at the original briefing, tweeting at the PM: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.”Outrage aside, Tusk is a seasoned politician and is wise enough to know a general election is coming. Evenhe asked for a humiliating extension, Boris could come back with a majority and a strengthened mandate to take the country to No Dealnecessary.It would have given the EU a reason to pause. Did they really want to take such a big risk and damage relations with the UK, especiallyBoris was going towith No Deal in his manesto  Boris has blustered his way through the critics, promising to “get Brexit done” despite the odds ening every day.At times it has all looked a bit desperate. But the UK doesn’t hold all the cards. To get a deal through, Boris needs the Irish government to compromise too. Varadkar’s stubbornness was a sticking point. Ireland’s leader, like everyone , knows Theresa May’s deal was not supported in Parliament.Showing no signs of movement on the issue would make the Irish just as culpable of creating a hard border as those in Westminster. This hardline briefing is not how any of us want to deal with our friends and allies in Europe. But the brinkmanship looks like it has produced results.We are not out of the woods by any means. At this moment, we are still not clear on any details of the new proposals. So you can see why No kept up the pressure on No Deal, why Chancellor Sajid Javid committed to spending more than £billion to get the Government ready to go and why Michael Gove is working on plans to put all that spending in place.For all the worry about No Deal, keeping it on the table was a necessary step to strengthen our position. Claims the Government was looking for a legal loophole to remove the obstacles now appear fancul.But the EU would have taken note and would have worried about stubbornly sticking to its positionthe threat of No Deal suddenly reappeared. If we are serious about a deal, No should end the hardline rhetoric. The EU will not make this easy. And why should they  But their cautious welcome of the breakthrough with Ireland means we have reasons to be cheerful.Now is the time for cool heads and for Boris to engage in a statesmanlike way. He needs to get to grips with the detail of exactly how we can make an alternative to the backstop work. Sadly, that’s not even the hard part.Any deal will need to come back to Parliament, where tribal loyalties, political positioning and genuine anger have intensied in recent months. There is almost no chance opposition parties will back anything that comes back from Brussels.So the only way to deliver Brexit is to bring together the fractious parts of the Conservative Party, the breakaway Tory rebel MPs and the hardcore Brexit “Spartans”.There is hope this can be done. The rebels will want to avoid a No Deal exit, which any deal would prevent, and the Spartans have started to see that leaving in an orderly way may be the only chance they have to get us out.The alternative could be more months of delay, ending in a second referendum. None of which they could possibly want. And there is one other group to win over, the dangerously dficult DUP.They are critical to parliamentary success. So far, they have stayed tight-lipped about the latest developments, only reiterating their original position of leaving with the rest of the UK.He needs to get Brexit done so he can start repairing the damage getting us here has created.

I joined your Cabinet in good faith accepting that no deal had to be on the table, because it was the means by which we would have the best chance of achieving a new deal to leave on October .However, I no longer believe leaving with a deal is the Governments main objective.The Government is expending a lot of energy to prepare for no deal but I have not seen the same level of intensity go into our talks with the European Union, who have asked us to present alternative arrangements to the Irish backstop.The updates I have been grateful to receive from your office have not, regretfully, provided me with the reassurances I sought.I must also address the assault on decency and democracy that took place last week when you sacked  talented, loyal One Nation Conservatives.This short-sighted culling of my colleagues has stripped the party of broad-minded and dedicated Conservative MPs I cannot support this act of political vandalism.Therefore, it is with regret that I am also surrendering the Conservative whip.Britains body politic is under attack from both sides of the ideological debate.

The evidence is extremely clear what happened.Weve been told that there is CCTV evidence showing her leaving RAF Croughton on the wrong side of the road and that CCTV follows her all the way down the road on the wrong side of the road and you see Harrys headlight of his motorbike and then there is a big fireball when his bike went up.So it should have been a clear-cut case. It should have been simple and I promised Harry and we promised Harry as a family when wed lost him that night, when we were talking to him in the hospital when wed lost him already, that we would make sure justice was done.Describing her pain at losing her son, Charlotte said she has been unable to cry as she is not able to understand this whole situation.She added: All of our grief has gone on hold, its coming out in other horric ways, your legs feel like lead, youre in pain morning until night that no pain killers can take away.The mum also revealed Sacoolas children were in the car at the time and must also be suffering, adding: Our lad wasnt a little lad, the car was extremely damaged as well as Harry.Her pain was echoed by dad Tim, who appealed to US President Donald Trump to help bring the US diplomats we back to the UK.He said: I would say to him as a man, as a father, how could you let this happen,you are a father and your child died surely youd want that person to own up and take responsibility Ive always wanted to ask hershe could explain the moment of the crash, find outshe comforted Harry,she spoke to Harry, find out what her movements were, did she try and call the emergency services, or I dont know.Im just struggling because I cant imagine my lad being in the ditch and not having any comfort from anybody until the ambulance and police turn up X minutes later.Family spokesman Radd Seiger said the parents will only meet hershe promises to come back to the UK and face the consequences.Harrys dad Tim today broke down at he told CBS about his sons final moments.He said: Yeswhen I got there the paramedics were just putting him onto the stretcher pulling him out of the grass verge.I could see broken bones out of his arms, he was talking he knew .I called over and said Harry its your dad, theyre going to fix you. Be calm let them help youI said Harry, theyre going to sedate you now, its for the best, youre going to be OK.The heartbroken parents now believe they are “stepping in the right direction” and hope to have a face-to-face meeting with Sacoolas.They also want to meet US President Donald Trump to vent their fury at the handling of the case.Their son Harry, , died seven weeks ago when Sacoolas, , allegedly smashed into his motorbike while driving her Volvo outside RAF Croughton, in Northamptonshire.She claimed immunity in the wake of the fatal crash because her husband Jonathan worked in intelligence the base.When it emerged that Sacoolas no longer had this protection, the American finally broke her silence and offered to meet with Harry’s family to express her deepest sympathies and apologies.But Charlotte told Sky News that sorry just doesnt cut it and thats not really quite enough.With the news that she no longer has diplomatic immunity over the car crash which killed Brit Harry Dunn, , in August, the US intelligence officer’s we broke her silence yesterday.Mrs Sacoolas’s lawyers said she wanted to meet Harry’s family “to express her deepest sympathy and apologies”.Understandably, Harry’s parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn were less than impressed as they flew to America yesterday in search of justice, and Charlotte said: “As it’s nearly seven weeks now since we lost our boy, sorry just doesn’t cut it.”If the “devastated” Mrs Sacoolas truly does appreciate the pain Harry’s loss has caused, she will hopefully admit she was wrong to flee England,and let police continue their investigations.In the meantime, we hope a meeting with Harry’s parents will help them on the way towards some sort of closure.It’s the very least they deserve.Earlier, they were handed the letter from Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab confirming Sacoolas does not have immunity.The letter said: The UK governments position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas case, because she has ed home.The US have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent.The letter goes on to say the police and the CPS would now take the case forward.And Tim Dunn said Mr Raabs letter was excellent news.Harrys family had appealed to Mr Raab to intervene in the case but were told the US government had twice refused requests for Sacoolas immunity to be waived.Mum Charlotte had previously described Sacoolas protection as an abuse of diplomatic immunity.The media reporting has been inaccurate in many respects. To begin with, Anne fully cooperated with the police and the investigation.She spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and met with the Northampton police at her home the following day. She will continue to cooperate with the investigation.Anne would like to meet with Mr Dunns parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident.We have been in contact with the familys attorneys and look forward to hearing from them.Speaking to The Sunday Times, she told how the last time she saw her son alive was when he rode past her on the motorbike as she made her way home from work.She said: I put my hand up and I smiled to myself and thought: Ill see you in a couple of hours.Charlotte revealed her tragic son broke his body in the devastating crash - but his £ helmet left his beautul face unscathed.She has hit out at Sacoolas for fleeing the country without giving answers - and said the nightmare ordeal has affected Harrys twin brother Niall the most.The immunity only usually covers those based in London, but a special deal with the US extended that to RAF Croughton.Charlotte told the newspaper: Its inhumane. Its not right.Its not just a clear-cut case of driving on the wrong side of the road, Oops, sorry! A le has been taken.Northamptonshire Police have now passed a file to the CPS to decide on whether to prosecute her for causing death by dangerous driving.Downing Street last week said the case was extremely concerning and urged the US to reconsider their position so the justice process can take place.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I didnt find any major inconsistencies or shortcomings in relation to his evidence.Mr Dean said the primary reason the defendant camped at the bus stop near Harrys home was because he knew that Mr Styles lived close by.He added: Mr Styles felt sorry for a young man who he saw to be living without a home during the winter when it was cold and raining very heavily and having first noticed him he then out of goodness of his heart stopped on the tenth of March and offered to fund the defendants hotel accommodation that evening.I found the suggestion that Mr Styles also, the suggestion that he would accompany the defendant for fun to be completely incredible.These were honest, well intended, good intentions from somebody who was trying to help another for whom he felt sorry and who he thought was down on his luck.He knew perfectly well that what he was doing at that stage amounted to harassment of Mr Styles.Im quite satisfied that this behaviour had the effect of harassing Mr Styles.The court heard today how Tarazaga-Orero made the -year-old star incredibly uncomfortable after he continued to camp outside his home, approach him at his local pub, post £. through his letter box before requesting it back and physically reached out to him on the street while he was jogging.The former One Direction singer denied he ever gave the defendant money to have fun in a hotel.Harry told the court he bought vegan food and offered the Spaniard hotel money when he first spotted him outside his Hampstead home in March.Tarazaga-Orero, who swore on a Hare Krishna holy book, claims he refused Harrys offers to buy him twice in March.The pop star gave evidence from behind a screen and said when he first saw the Spaniard he offered him money for a hotel and food because it was raining and it was cold.Harry said he looked for an open restaurant and reported his concerns to a police officer before buying the defendant sandwiches and muffins while on his way to work the next morning.He also told the court he saw the defendant at the bus stop  yards from his home at least five days a week from that day on.He added: He had hung some pictures on the wall at some point, there was always a trace of the fact that he had been there or he was ing at some point soon.Harry also told the court that Tarazaga-Orero tried to speak to him at his local pub The Spaniards Inn.He said: I saw him on several occasions.

I believe. I was very confused very very uncomfortable, very confused, I didnt really understand it.On May , the defendant posted two notes through his letter box asking for the sum of cash back and left his bank details for it to be transferred.Harry told the court his stalker had lunged at him and blocked his path as he went running at .pm.Harry told the court how the stalking has affected him.He said Ive employed a night guard which Ive never felt necessary before.I continue to lock my bedroom at night, I find myself assessing my residence and any weak spotsyou will and I worry about it much more, I never felt that way before.Very often in my job I see people on multiple occasions.

and what customs union the province will be in after we leave the bloc.The DUP were supportive last week of Boris new Brexit plan, which is now being discussed at .However, they explicitly said they would not accept a so-called customs partnership which Northern Ireland may be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.The partys Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said today: We will not be eating our own words.Our position is clear, the Government knows what our position is and we will not be dining from a dferent menu.But Boris has insisted Britain is leaving on October  no matter what happens.However, a new law passed last month may force Britain to ask for another delay.Last night Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg has said the Government could achieve a no-deal Brexit by using European law.Theresa May got an extension not through UK law but through EU law and, until the  European Communities Act is repealed, EU law is superior law in the UK, he said on BBC Radio s Westminster Hour.And the Remainiacs all know that, because they know that it takes two to tango and any extension has to be agreed by the council.Last night Michel Barnier said it would be very dficult to reach a deal before Boris  October deadline.He told EU ambassadors the plans were still not acceptable - despite concessions from the PM.It emerged yesterday that the bloc was asking for yet more movement from Britain, infuriating Tory backbenchers."},{"url":null,"title":"queens speech time parliament lords","story":"The speech is used to set out what the government intends to do in the next session of parliament and what the plans for the future are.The Queen is due to address parliament today at .am.The State Opening of Parliament is a full-blown state occasion with all the usual pomp and ceremony to go with it.Queen Elizabeth will be wearing ceremonial robes and a crown to deliver the speech that will have been written for her.A carriage procession will precede events.The actual speech is given in the House of Lords.The last State Opening took place on June , .Members of the Lords attend along with ambassadors and high commissioners.Judges from the High Court and Court of Appeal are also there along with Justices of the Supreme Court.MPs from the Commons can watch from the entrance to the chamber -

The Republican aposBeast of Bolsoverapos is known for shouting at the representative as a show of disrespect  - and today was no dferent. Lords messenger Black Rod - in ceremonial garb - traditionally knocks on for MPs on the Commons chamber door, and has it slammed in her face. This year when told that the Queen requested the MPsapos presence, Mr Skinner yelled out that he didnapost want to go with laughter echoing round the chamber.

But she has decided to break one of the key traditions she has followed since taking the throne in  - not wearing the heavy and priceless crown. Itaposs the second time in her reign that she has decided not to wear it for the ceremonial occasion, the last being in  because of the snap election.   The Imperial State Crown was originally made for King George VIaposs coronation in . The design was based on the crown worn by Queen Victoria in , featuring a number of priceless gemstones including the Second Star of Africa, the Black Princeaposs Ruby, the Stuart Sapphire and St Edwardaposs Sapphire.  In total there are , diamonds in silver mounts,  sapphires,  emeralds and  pearls. However it is very, very heavy - so itaposs hardly surprising that at  the Queen has decided it might be time to swap to a lighter alternative. Instead she is wearing the George IV diadem, a smaller and lighter diamond crown.  The Queen first wore the piece on the way to her coronation in , before it was replaced by the Imperial State Crown during the service. It dates back to  and features roses, shamrocks and thistles with , diamonds and  pearls. In  the Queen didnapost wear a crown at all, opting for a blue and yellow hat instead - which many people believed was a nod to the EU.  Theresa Mayaposs snap election meant  the date for the State Opening of Parliament was set for just a few days after the grand ceremony of Trooping the Colour, which marks the Queenaposs official birthday each year. Both events are huge feats of organisation, with a Sovereignaposs Escort from the Household Cavalry Regiment, and the Queen’s route lined by hundreds of service personnel. And them taking place so close together meant there was not enough time for sufficient rehearsal and preparation. This meant the Queenaposs Speech was a more casual affair than weaposre used to.

Commuter rockets to Mars, scrapping income tax, free unicorns for all - he could promise it all, safe in the knowledge he wonapost have to deliver it. Thataposs because unlike most Queenaposs Speeches, which lay out laws for the coming year, this one is likely to be voted down - and then be scrapped anywaythe country plunges into a snap election. Despite the open goal, though, there are some things in Boris Johnsonaposs announcement that still arenapost that great to look at - or that arenapost mentioned at all. Jeremy Corbyn picked up on some of them when he slammed the lack of action on social care and mental health, adding the speech was shockingly weak on education. Weaposve delved into a bit more detail. Hereaposs some of the small print Boris Johnson didnapost want you to read.  Boris Johnson has been accused of paying lip service to social care after the Queenaposs Speech didnapost give a time limit or details of any reform. Notes to the Queenaposs Speech said: We will bring forward substantive proposals to fix the crisis. But they gave no time limit, did not confirm the nature of any proposals, and did not propose a law in the current one-year Parliament. They repeated an already-announced £.bn cash injection. But £m of that has to be raised by councils through a % rise in the council tax precept. Jane Ashcroft, chief executive of Anchor Hanover, England’s largest not-for-profit provider of care and housing for older people, said: It is exasperating to see government once again pay lip service to social care, and failing to meaningfully address the deepening crisis. Kathryn Hill, Director of England at Carers Trust, said: “Carers Trust is extremely concerned to hear the government is proposing only a partial commitment to reform. Genevieve Edwards, Director of External Affairs at the MS Society, said: “It’s incredibly troubling that social care for working-age disabled people has been dismissed yet again. A No spokesman said the government had set out its commitment to reform social care to end the fear of people having to sell their homes to pay for care. But he admitted: I canapost set out a timeline now. We will be setting it out in due course.  Boris Johnson is accused of using the Queen’s Speech as a “blatant” attempt to rig the result of the next election after it slipped out a pledge to force voters to show ID. Her Majesty said: My Government will take steps to protect the integrity of democracy and the electoral system in the United Kingdom. But the small print confirms this involves ramming ahead with a highly controversial ID scheme, despite concerns it will lock millions out of democracy. Voters will be forced to show an approved form of photographic ID in order to vote - despite there being just eight allegations of fraud at a polling station last year. For comparison, a whopping  people were turned away in a recent trial in eight council areas. The Electoral Reform Society today warned it could be another Windrush - the scandal that saw Brits who came from the Caribbean threatened with deportation. “These plans risk excluding huge numbers of marginalised voters – including many elderly and BAME voters – from our democratic processes and risk undermining free and fair elections, ERS director Dr Jess Garland said. No launched a furious response. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman claimed the absence of voter ID in Britain is a “security risk” and said voter ID has run in Northern Ireland since  “without any impact on the number of people who go and vote”. But askedthe government could point to any evidence of widespread voter fraud at the ballot box, the spokesman did not. And a No spokesman snapped: I’m not sure politically we’ll be taking messages about voter suppression from a party whose main mandate at the moment is to suppress the biggest vote in the democratic history of this country.  The government has produced more than  pages of notes to the Queenaposs Speech. But it has no specic mention of housing, tenants or renting.And crucially, a pledge to end no-fault evictions - where landlords ditch tenants at short notice without good reason - does not appear in the speech at all. When the axe to no-fault evictions was announced under Theresa May in April, the government claimed it would be the biggest change to the private rental sector for a generation. Yet despite a consultation closing on Friday, thereaposs not even lip service paid to it in the governmentaposs notes. That means thereaposs almost zero chance of a legal change in the next year. And a No spokesman today refused to sayBoris Johnson is sticking to the pledge when quizzed by the Mirror. Instead he said: The Queenaposs Speech you have now is not the totality of what the government will do. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: “It’s frustrating to see the housing emergency missing from the government’s agenda in the face of the current crisis. With more than , people homeless and millions fighting for a stable home, this is not something it can ignore. . Action to keep kids safe online isnapost here yet...  Ministers had pledged to improve internet safety for children and vulnerable people. But thereaposs no Bill announced yet in todayaposs Queenaposs Speech - which means a law would be unlikely to come forward in the next year. Last month, ministers pledged they will establish in law a new duty of care making web giants responsible for their users. Yet today, the notes say only: “My Ministers will continue to develop proposals to improve internet safety. Andy Burrows, NSPCC Head of Child Safety Online, said: “Child abuse on the Wild West Web must stop. The Government’s commitment to online harms is positive, but it is crucial it treats children’s safety as a matter of urgency. Boris Johnson must stick to previous commitments and introduce an Online Harms Bill in this session.  There will be a White Paper by the end of this year setting out the governmentaposs response to possible reforms to the Mental Health Act. It comes after pleas for patients not to be detained any more than is absolutely necessary and ensure their views are respected. However there are no immediate plans for a new law in the coming Parliament - as itaposs not one of the  Bills in the Queenaposs Speech. Sophie Corlett of Mind, the mental health charity, said: The urgency of reviewing the Mental Health Act cannot be overstated.Increasing numbers of people being sectioned under the Act are enduring substandard treatment due to poor conditions, lack of choice, loss of dignity and even racial discrimination. This can’t go on. “It is almost a year since the Independent Review of the Mental Health Act was published and we now need to see action. ... Or criminal sanctions for Grenfell-style building owners  The speech documents talk of a fundamental change in the regulations on high-rise tower blocks to ensure accountability and responsibility from their owners. Over the weekend there was talk of this leading to criminal sanctions. But there is no mention in the Queenaposs Speech documents of criminal sanctions. And the crackdown is only planned for some time in the future - it is not one of the  firm laws announced today in the Queenaposs Speech. . Thereaposs still no date for a reform of restaurant workersapos tips  Restaurants will be forced to hand over all tips to staff - more than three years after the Tories first promised to crack down on the loophole. But thereaposs no date in the Queenaposs Speech, or its notes, for when the EmploymentBill might come into force. And itaposs not thought to be among more than half a dozen Bills which are being rushed forward to Parliament this week.Its inclusion in the Queenaposs Speech suggests the law would be passed in the next year. But thataposs not the same as it coming into force. A No spokesman was unable to give a firm date.

Todayaposs Queenaposs Speech - the first for more than two years - includes  Bills with a focus on law and order, the environment and improving animal welfare. Yet it also contains measures that could rig the next election against Labour voters. The vast majority of what was announced today was already announced in the past. And of course none of this has to be implementedan election is triggered in the coming weeks - something most people expect. Plus, it faces being voted down for the first time since  as the PM struggles to govern with a majority hovering near minus . Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: This Queenaposs Speech is farcical. It is just an uncosted wish list which the Government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast.    Measures to let workers keep tips and reform orce law will finally be brought back after the Tories dragged their feet. Boris Johnson claimed an Environment Bill will be the huge star of his programme - weeks after Labour backed reaching net zero carbon emissions by  - by imposing new charges on some single use plastics. There will be legislation to keep serious criminals in prison for longer, impose tougher sentences on foreign offenders whoto the UK and provide better protection for victims of domestic abuse.    Brexit is of course there too - with measures to end free movement, pass a Brexit deal and carry over trade deals between the UK and EU. And the PM forced the Queen to read out his priority of leaving the EU by October . Boris Johnson bullishly claimed the speech will get the gears on our national gearbox working again as he sung the praises of the NHS and police. The Prime Minister added: This Queenaposs Speech delivers on my promise as PM to get this amazing country of ours moving again. People are tired of stasis, gridlock and waiting for change. THE BREXIT DEAL . EUBill  The first Bill in the Queenaposs Speech will implement any Brexit deal Boris Johnson gets with the EU. It will aim to put into law a new way to prevent checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. It will also confirm a transition period, running to December , where we continue to follow EU rules and send money to the EU. We all knew about this already. But crucially, turning it into an Act of Parliament allows MPs to have a vote on Boris Johnsonaposs deal. If he gets it, that is. The PM has until Wednesday to work out something that can be put to  EU leaders at a crucial summit on Thursday. . Fisheries Bill Powers to control access to UK waters will be enshrined in law with licences for foreign vessels - which will no longer have the automatic right to access our seas. New powers will impose restrictions on UK fishermen - either quotas or number of days at sea - to replace the current Common Fisheries Policy. Grants would also be available to fishermen to conserve, enhance and restore the marine and aquatic environment. And EU law could be amended to allow the UK to respond to new advice on fish stocks. . Agriculture Bill The Bill will set up a seven-year transition period that gradually reduces payments to farmers that came under the EUaposs Common Agricultural Policy. The current subsidy system - which rewards the amount of land owned - will be replaced and focus on action farmers take to farm sustainably and help the environment. . Trade Bill The Bill allows the legal carry-over of trade deals that the UK currently enjoys as an EU member. However, this carrying over is still not automatic and the UK would need to negotiate the transition with inidual countries around the world. The Bill also establishes a new independent UK body to protect British firms against unfair trade practices - like dumping of imports such as Chinese steel. CRACKDOWN ON FREE MOVEMENT . Immigration and Social Security Co-OrdinationBill  This is the flagship Bill to end free movement after Brexit - including forcing checks on EU citizens who come to Britain from January . It will pave the way for an Australia-style points-based system, which Ukip has previously backed. It would score potential migrants based on their education, skills and expected salary level. But Home Secretary Priti Patel drew scorn after saying she wants to make the system more generous to people willing to live outside London. Offering preferential treatment to migrants who agree to live in the North of England was branded “confused” and an unworkable “gimmick” - with Labour saying it would do nothing to solve the shortage of workers in the NHS. The Bill doesnapost actually introduce this points-based system - just sets up a framework for it. It will also ensure Irish citizens generally can enter and live in the UK freely. And it will confirm the deadline of December  for new EU arrivals to apply to stay - with or without a Brexit deal.    . Financial Services Bill This Bill will simply the process which allows overseas investment funds to be sold in the UK. The government has trumpeted this as a cutting of red tape, while upholding the UKaposs world-leading standards. But it could prompt fears from some about letting financial markets run free. The Bill also allows for long-term market access to the UK for financial services firms based in Gibraltar. . Private International LawBill This Bill is designed to clary the law on disputes over kids that stretch across national borders. It involves three treaties - the ,  and  Hague Conventions. They include making it harder for parents who leave the country to evade paying child maintenance and allowing co-operation between governments on family cases. . Health Service Safety Investigations Bill A new Health Service Safety Investigations Body will have powers to conduct investigations into NHS incidents that have implications for patient safety. People will be banned from leaking or publishing information held by this body, to ensure witnesses and whistleblowers are more candid. There will also be a duty on the Health Secretary to ensure enough medical examiners are appointed in England. And advice, guidance and training will be provided to local bodies to improve medical probes. HARDLINE TREATMENT OF SERIOUS PRISONERS . Sentencing Bill  Violent criminals and sex offenders will face longer sentences in a tough justice crackdown. The point where prisoners are usually released will be moved from halfway through a sentence to two-thirds - for adults serving at least four years for serious violent and sexual offenders. The focus appears to be a U-turn on previous Tory bids to focus on rehabilitation, which would have removed the need for the shortest sentences in favour of community work. The Bill will also extend the range of reasons a judge can use to slap a whole le prison term on a convicted murderer. . Foreign National Offenders Bill The law and order package includes a bill to drastically increase the sentences for foreign criminals whoto the UK in breach of a deportation order. The exact increase however isnapost actually spelt out in the Queenaposs Speech. Ministers claim the move will help disrupt the activities of international crime gangs. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: We have been a soft touch on foreign criminals for too long. HELENaposS LAW . PrisonersBill  A new law will make it easier to deny parole to murderers, or those guilty of manslaughter, who refuse to say where their victims are buried. The same law will apply to people who take indecent photographs of children while refusing to say who those children were. The law will be known as Helenaposs Law after -year-old Helen McCourt who was murdered in  - leading to a long campaign by her mother Marie. Her murderer was convicted but has refused to say where he hid her body. Despite claims by ministers, the law wonapost actually force Parole Boards to keep these murderers and paedophiles locked up. Instead it will put a legal obligation on them to take into account the issue when considering release. . Serious Violence Bill There will be a new legal duty on agencies like councils, schools, social services and health providers to work together and share data to prevent serious violence. This will include introducing an explicit priority in law on serious violence for Community Safety Partnerships. It comes after a surge in kne attacks. But critics are likely to complain it is shting the burden onto cuts-hit local authorities. PROTECTION FOR POLICE OVER CAR CHASES . Police Protections Bill Police will face a new test to grade their driving - which can then be taken into accountthey end up being investigated over a crash. This is in a bid to stop police facing prosecution unfairly for people they injure or kill when taking part in a car chase. The Bill will also force the Home Office to report annually on progress on the Police Covenant. And Special Constableswill be able to to get the same support as members of the Police Federation. FUGITIVES ARRESTED WITHOUT A WARRANT . ExtraditionBill This is designed to make it easier for police to arrest internationally wanted fugitives - without the need to apply for a UK arrest warrant. The idea is to cut out a waiting period of six to eight hours which fugitives can use to evade justice. Those being arrested must be subject of an Interpol Red notice. Initially it will only apply to those issued by a limited number of countries with trusted justice systems, the other members of the Five Eyes intelligence group, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and two non-EU European states, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. However the Government will be able to add other countries by minor laws, possibly with minimal scrutiny in Parliament. DOMESTIC ABUSE AND DIVORCE REFORMS FINALLY RETURN . Domestic Abuse Bill The Tories will bring back the Domestic Abuse Bill - which fell as a result of Mr Johnsonaposs unlawful suspension of Parliament. This law was introduced under Theresa May but still wasnapost implemented, to the fury of campaigners. It will stop abusers from being able to cross-examine their victims in the family courts. Victims will be assumed eligible for special measures in criminal courts, like giving evidence via video link. It will create a statutory definition of domestic abuse to include physical violence, emotional abuse, economic abuse and coercive control. And a Domestic Abuse Commissioner will monitor the response of councils and the justice system. . Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Bill Plans for aposquickieapos orces will also come forward again after being stalled under the Tories. Reforms will remove the need to prove bad conduct or a period of separation. Instead couples will be able to just tell a court their marriage has irretrievably broken down. And an obstructive partner will no longer be able to contest a orce from happening. In those measuresapos place will be a -week waiting period between the start of proceedings and the final order for a orce. LONG-DELAYED PLANS TO LET WORKERS KEEP TIPS . EmploymentBill  Restaurants will be forced to hand over tips to staff - more than three years after the Tories first promised to crack down on abuses. The new law in the Queenaposs Speech will force employers to pass on all gratuities in full and to share fairly any pooled tips. The Tories first promised to tackle the injustice under then-business secretary Sajid Javid who ordered a two-month consultation ending on June , . But Theresa May then failed to bring in the change during her time in office. Today the EmploymentBill also introduces a Code of Practice for restaurants, bars and cafes to make the system transparent. Ten years ago, the Mirror launched our Fair Tips campaign with Unite the Union after a Pizza Express manager was sacked for revealing that the company kept % of tips paid by bank cards as an “administration fee”.    . Pension Schemes Bill On pensions there were new rules planned around everything from saving to viewing to accessing your money. First was saving – with plans announced for new “collective” workplace pensions schemes. These would see staff and firms pay into a single, shared, pot rather than inidual pots for each person. The idea is that it could be more efficient and offer better value. Second there were plans to force firms to take part in the new “pensions dashboard” project - this is set to be a single location where you can see all your retirement savings at once. But unless everyone gets involved it wonapost work. So plans to force firms to take part are a needed first step. Finally there were new rules planned about where, when and to who you can transfer your pension to. These are needed as there have been cases where scammers have convinced people to move their money, and honest firms have been powerless to stop it. On a more technical front, there were also bigger penalties and criminal offences planned for firms that break pensions rules and better protection for people saving when companies go bust. . Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill This will aim to roll out gigabit capable broadband across the UK to achieve nationwide coverage as soon as possible. The government claims it will allow faster speeds that can download an HD film in fewer than  seconds. All new build buildings will need the infrastructure to support gigabit connections. And they will have to be installed in most new-build homes. NEW POWERS TO TACKLE DRONES    . Air Traffic Management and Unmanned Aircraft Bill Police will be given new powers to tackle the unlawful use of drones. This include forcing a person to land a drone and enhanced stop and search powersan offence involving an unmanned aircraft has taken place. The laws will also apply to model planes and model helicopters. It comes after the number of drone or model aircraft collisions skyrocketed from  in  to  in  - including a spate of shutdowns of Gatwick Airport in a mystery that still hasnapost been resolved. NEW CHARGES ON SINGLE USE PLASTICS . Environment Bill  The government has responded to pressure to ramp up environmental protection. It comes as critics warn that the UKaposs regulations will be weaker than the EUaposs once Brexit happens. The new moves include introducing charges for single use plastics following on from the carrier bag charge. Councils will be given powers to clamp down on sources of air pollution. While communities will have more of a say on the protection of natural habitats through the Local Nature Recovery Strategies. The Queenaposs Speech confirms the creation of a new Office for Environmental Protection first announced last December. It will have the power to take the government to court to enforce environmental law after Brexit. Climate change has been pushed up the agenda in recent months with protests organised by groups including Extinction Rebellion and the international school strikes begun by Sweedish teen Greta Thunberg. Boris Johnsonaposs girlfriend Carrie Symonds, who is a senior adviser for US environmental campaign group Oceana, has urged politicians to act saying they have a gigantic responsibility to care for the environment.  FIVE YEARSapos JAIL FOR ANIMAL ABUSERS . Animal WelfareBill The maximum sentence for animal cruelty offences will be massively ramped up from six months to five years - confirming plans already announced under the Tories. There will also be a clear statement in domestic law that animals are sentient beings, following a controversy some years ago. And there will be a duty on government to have all due regard to the welfare of sentient animals when forming and running new policies. What  is in the Queenaposs Speech  Many measures are in the Queenaposs Speech - or the briefing documents around it - that arenapost spelt out fully in the speech as one of the  Bills. These include: Voter ID crackdown to aposrig the electionapos Boris Johnson has been accused of using Mondayaposs Queen’s Speech as a “blatant” attempt to rig the result of the next election. The Queenaposs Speech paves the way for measures to force voters to show photo ID before being allowed to vote. Hundreds of people were denied their right to vote in last year’s local elections after ministers forced through a pilot scheme, despite warnings it could disenfranchise older voters and people from minority groups. The trial, which was held in eight council areas, resulted in  people being turned away. Yet figures show there were just eight allegations of people lying about who they are at a polling station - known as personation - in . That was down from  in ,  in ,  in  and  in , the Electoral Commission figures show.  A White Paper on mental health There will be a White Paper by the end of this year setting out the governmentaposs response to possible reforms to the Mental Health Act. It comes after pleas for patients not to be detained any more than is absolutely necessary and ensure their views are respected. However there are no immediate plans for a new law in the coming Parliament. Tory pledges on NHS and police The Queenaposs Speech will sit alongside measures already announced to invest in the NHS, strengthen environmental protections and raise living standards through increasing the national living wage to £. an hour by  for over-s. Also mentioned is the pledge to hire , more police officers... which almost but not quite reverses Tory cuts to numbers since . Stopping a repeat of Thomas Cook A new law will attempt to stop a repeat of the Thomas Cook debacle by giving the Civil Aviation Authority oversight over airlines in distress. There arenapost confirmed plans or a set Bill yet. Six other Bills There are six Bills not mentioned by the Queen herself in addition to the . They include allowing the building of part of HS - despite the risk the rail line will be scrapped altogether in a government review. It also involves a Bill to make it easier for NHS hospitals to manufacture and trial medicines and medical devices. Other technical Bills will allow further payments under the Windrush compensation scheme to Brits who arrived from the Caribbean before the s - and technical changes to legal sentencing in the criminal courts. What ISNaposT in the Queenaposs Speech now  A firm plan for social careThe Tories have kicked the can down the road on social care yet again with no plans for the ailing sector contained in the Queenaposs Speech. Despite promising an optimistic and ambitious programme of domestic legislation, the Prime Minister has failed to set out how to tackle the growing crisis. Theresa May  was accused of kicking the can down the road after she repeatedly delayed plans for a ‘green paper’ on social care first planned for summer . Her blighted social care plans in the  general election campaign were dubbed a “dementia tax” and blamed for the Tories losing their majority in the  general election. During the Tory leadership contest,  Boris Johnson  said he had a reform plan ready to go once he arrived in office. But so far there has been no suggestion of what the government would actually do.

She unveiled  new Bills in Parliament, which probably wonapost be made law because Parliament is likely to be dissolved for an election. But that wasnapost the only way she happened to fulfil the PMaposs political dreams. Thereaposs also Brexit. Her Majesty turned heads with the opening words of her speech - because they were all about Brexit. She even explicitly mentioned the exit date of October . Now, itaposs important to note the government - not the Queen - writes the Queenaposs Speech. And on closer inspection her wording definitely wasnapost the gung-ho language of Johnson. But itaposs still a far cry from when she wore a hat resembling an EU flag at the  State Opening of Parliament. So weaposve reproduced what she said, and had a stab at what it might mean.   The Queen opened her speech today by saying the governmentaposs priority has always been to leave the EU on October . My Government’s priority has always been to secure the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on  October. My Government intends to work towards a new partnership with the European Union, based on free trade and friendly cooperation.What does the wording tell us   On the one hand, Boris Johnsonaposs inserted the October  date into the Queenaposs Speech. Some might see that as a provocative statement of intent. But on the other, what did she actually say  It turns out the Queen used much less firm wording on Brexit than everything . The rest of her speech is littered with firm promises in the present or future tense. My government will bring forward. My ministers will ensure. My government remains committed. But not the bit about Brexit. This was placed firmly in the past tense. And it didnapost promise to leave the EU on Halloween - instead saying it has been a priority. What brought on this sudden moderate language  Did the Monarch, weeks after she was politicised to unlawfully shut down Parliament, signal that she didnapost want to be seen to give a view on Brexit  Or did Downing Street act first - keeping the wording gentle to avoid infuriating the Palace  Without a view inside the secretive communications between No and Buckingham Palace, we canapost know for sure. But itaposs certainly interesting that the phrase was worded as it was.   The last Queenaposs Speech in  didnapost go as far as todayaposs. It didnapost mention an exit date and merely spoke of securing the best possible deal. She also delivered it wearing a hat that resembled the EU flag. My government’s priority is to secure the best possible deal as the country leaves the European Union. My ministers are committed to working with Parliament, the devolved administrations, business and others to build the widest possible consensus on the country’s future outside the European Union.Why was the  speech so dferent  "},{"url":null,"title":"queens speech forces monarch reel","story":"NewsQueens Speech forces monarch to reel off Boris Johnsons election promisesThe State Opening of Parliament saw the monarch forced to repeat the PMs increasingly unlikely promise to take Britain out of the EU by October ShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political EditorMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video queen-delivers-first-speech-boris-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics queens-speech-forces-monarch-reel-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

And reeling off a speech written for her by Mr Johnson and his ministers, she had to repeat the PMaposs increasingly unlikely promise to take Britain out of the EU by October . Plans to boost animal welfare, create an Office for Veterans Affairs and push through what Mr Johnson dubbed a “momentous new Environment Bill - a lodestar by which we will guide our country towards a cleaner and greener future” were among  Bills unveiled. Other legislation includes a long-delayed shake-up of social care, tougher sentences for the most serious criminals and confirmation of two Mirror victories on banning imports from trophy hunting and on Helen’s Law, which will mean killers who refuse to reveal where they hid victims will be denied parole.    The move comes after a campaign by Marie McCourt, mother of Helen McCourt who vanished in February  aged . Her murderer was convicted but has refused to say where he hid her body. The Queen said: New sentencing laws will see that the most serious offenders spend longer in custody to reflect better the severity of their crimes. A Sentencing Bill will change the automatic release point from halfway to two thirds for adult offenders serving sentences of four years or more for serious violence or sexual offences.At the same time ministers are preparing to rush through a bill to raty any Brexit deal Mr Johnson is able to agree this week in Brussels in time for Britain to leave on the EU on October .   In an introduction to Queen’s Speech, the PM also promised “one of the greatest eras of infrastructure investment in everything from rail to roads to gigabit broadband” as he aimed to “get the gears on our national gearbox working again” after Brexit.But the pomp and ceremony of the traditional State Opening, amid tight security and foul weather , triggered fury that Her Majesty was being exploited for political purposes as the Tories gear up for an expected election.Mr Johnson has a majority of minus  and is extremely unlikely to win crunch votes on the Queen’s Speech next week, potentially setting the stage for another ballot - and meaning the address is more of a political broadcast than setting the parliamentary agenda.Jeremy Corbyn has branded the speech a party political broadcast from the steps of the throne.   On Sunday he told Sky News it was utterly ludicrous for the PM so be setting out his proposals when he is running a Government that is now in minus  and which hasnapost yet won a vote in Parliament The Government will also bring back the Domestic Abuse Bill which fell as a result of Mr Johnsonaposs unlawful suspension of Parliament last month. Ministers had already announced plans to protect holidaymakers from being stranded abroadairlines go under, which was in the Queenaposs Speech. The monarch also announced proposals for the revolutionary reform of Britainaposs railways.    It is believed this includes proposals to scrap the rail franchising system, the contracting out of services introduced when the rail system was privatised in the s, and replacing it with a “new commercial model.”Mr Johnson is promising to deliver on a pledge by his predecessor Theresa May to ensure all tips are paid to waiting staff following an outcry that some major restaurant chains - such as Giraffe and Prezzo - were keeping as much as % of tips paid by card.The EmploymentBill will put a legal obligation on restaurateurs to pass on all trips, gratuities and services charges to workers without deductions.

Seventy percent admitted they donapost think a aposthank youapos is required when a waiter serves them food at a restaurant.

She had brought her gorgeous baby boy Ellis into bed with her during the night to feed him, so she reached out for him. When I woke up I knew something wasnapost right. I put my hand on his head and he was cold. She went into autopilot, shouting for her husband to call and ambulance and doing mouth-to-mouth. I just thought I need to make him breathe. I was trying to remember all the things I learnt in Girl Guides as a child. But I couldnapost make him breathe and it was really frustrating. I suspect that he had probably been dead a while so I was never going to make him breathe.    Itaposs a very strange feeling knowing that youaposre trying to bring somebody back to le and theyaposre just not coming back. Ellis was just four days old when he died. Speaking toto mark Baby Loss Awareness Week, Louise speaks about the devastating hours and days that followed after her baby boy died suddenly from SIDS. Ellis, Louiseaposs first child with husband Jim, was born on Wednesday,  February . The couple, who live in East Yorkshire, were just getting used to their new lives as parents when they were hit by the worst possible tragedy. When the paramedics arrived they took him straight to hospital with Louise and Sam following behind in the car. I think they knew he was dead and there was nothing they could do.  Itaposs quite possible they were trying to do stuff they didnapost want us to see, Iaposm quite glad I didnapost go in the ambulance. When they got to the hospital they were taken straight to the family room. You see that on the telly. When they take people to the family room itaposs never good news. The doctoraposs face said the whole thing. I looked at him and said aposheaposs dead, isnapost heapos and he nodded. The rest of the day is a blur. They brought him through so we could see him. They were given the opportunity to spend some time with Ellis and invited members of their family, some who were yet to meet him at all, to say goodbye. It was quite surreal. It is the odd bits about it that you remember. The nurse was called Julie, Iaposve never forgotten that. She said she was going to look after him when we werenapost there. She made it right for us. She made sure she was in the room when we got there.  She was just so kind. He looked perfect but he wasnapost crying of moving. Itaposs something you wouldnapost wish on anybody. He just looked so perfect and thataposs what I will always remember. I just thought how can this be happening to us. What had I done  Some family members hadnapost met him yet. Those who hadnapost met him had their first cuddle. The first time my husbandaposs sister met him he had died. Some people didnapost want to cuddle him, itaposs very dferent cuddling a dead baby because it feels all wrong. I think everybody was exhausted by the emotion of the day. While they were at the hospital their home had been turned into a crime scene as police to check there hadnapost been any suspicious circumstances around the death. Officers also took away Ellisaposs clothes, nappies and their bedding. Youaposve just lost your child, itaposs like have a bit of respect, but they were just doing their job. Still in shock, the couple ed home without their little boy. We watched the wrestling of all things. It was a bizarre evening. What do you do   Youaposre supposed to have a baby to look after.  As Louise had been breastfeeding she still had to express her milk, which she found extremely dficult. Your body knows youaposve had a baby but it doesnapost know that baby isnapost there anymore so it still reacts. For weeks I could still hear a baby crying when there were no babies around. Youaposre supposed to have a baby for everyone to coo over. The staff at the hospital were amazing. Throughout the whole day people were amazing. Everyone tries to do the best for you. The police officers kept in touch every day, even on their days off. A full postmortem was carried out, including tests to seeEllis had suffocated from being in bed with his parents, but found nothing suspicious. Itaposs hard knowing your baby is having a postmortem done. I found that very hard to deal with. I found it very hard to contend with that it could have been my fault. They were told Ellis had died from SIDs and were given his death certicate. There was a relief that it wasnapost suffocation, but what does SIDs mean  It doesnapost mean anything. No one can give you any reason as to why he died. You donapost know why your child died. For me thataposs not good enough. There was no reason as to why he died.apos The results meant they could start planning the funeral.  It was the best funeral Iaposve ever been to, which is a weird thing to say. People came for me and Jim. It was lovely to see so many people. People were coming back together. He was still putting some good into the world. Both Louise and Jim decided to go back to work the day after the funeral in a bid to get some normality back in their lives. I just felt going back to work would give me something to focus on. Youaposre just sitting at home without a baby on maternity leave. You canapost go to mother and baby groups, all the other people you met at maternity groups are meeting up and sharing their babies. I didnapost want to meet up with them, I didnapost want to see them with their babies. I needed to go back. I needed to not be at home dwelling on things. Itaposs the kind of thing that you never get over but you learn to live with it. It never goes away. You have reminders every now and again. Three or four years later there was a cot death on Eastenders, itaposs those sort of things that set you back. Those are the things you canapost prepare for. Anniversaries and Christmas you know are coming. A year after losing Ellis, Louise and Jim welcomed baby Alex. When we found out we were pregnant we just thought aposoh my God whataposs going to happen, here we go againapos.

Sophia Williams had already been through four miscarriages, and had one little girl when she and her husband experienced tragedy once again. On Thursday, July , , the coupleaposs le changed forever when their daughter, Ava Hollie Williams, was stillborn just one day before her due date.Sophia has told Plymouth Live of her journey of heartbreak ending with her seventh pregnancy that finally yielded the coupleaposs aposrainbow babyapos - their healthy little boy Lowen.   Sophia,  and her husband Gareth, , who now live in Liskeard, have dedicated their time to supporting and helping other parents through stillbirth and pregnancy and set up Avaaposs Fund, in memory of their daughter. They have made it their mission to help other bereaved families and fundraise so that more training can be given to reduce the amount of stillbirths. Sophia has shared her own account of what it was like to become pregnant after suffering four miscarriages and the stillbirth of Ava. The words no parent wants to hear Saturday  November , I’m pregnant. I’m pregnant, the two pink lines I am staring at confirm it, it’s early in the morning and I am aware, before anyone  in the world that I am pregnant for the seventh time.    I get back into bed, wake my husband and tell him the news. We smile and yet we are terried. We’ve both experienced the same tragedy, we’ve both had the innocence of pregnancy taken away from us. I didn’t know how to feel. My body felt entangled with a multitude of emotion. I was excited, I felt immediate love for the new le growing inside of me, and I was happy for we had another chance of bringing home a sibling for our eldest daughter. On the flip side, dread, worry, concern and a longing for the future we could only hope this pregnancy would present us with filled my mind.    I prayed for a healthy living baby, as that’s all we wanted. Boy, girl, it honestly didn’t matter, so long as they were ok. Having previously suffered four miscarriages and the full term stillbirth of our second daughter Ava, it was dficult to believe our dreams would become a reality. The next eight months were some of the hardest I have ever lived through. I was going to have to find a strength I never knew I had. I’d seek help from sources which I’d never known existed and I’d worry each day about a million and one dferent things.    At my first midwe appointment, my midwe walked out of the room and wrapped her arms around me. We’d been in the same position just a few months earlier when she’d booked me in for my sixth pregnancy. Another tiny baby I tragically went on to miscarry at ten weeks gestation. We’d miscarried three times before this in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. Our first miscarriage happened on my birthday in  while we were in Disneyland Paris... During my first midwe appointment my midwe kindly suggested the services provided by the Perinatal Mental Health Team. Putting on a brave face I told her I’d be ok. But I wouldn’t be andI’d been honest with myself, I knew that I wouldn’t be. I just didn’t want to admit it.    The first twelve weeks of my son’s pregnancy were filled with concern regarding miscarriage. Prior to finding out I had fallen pregnant with him, I’d just started to have investigations as to why I’d miscarried on four occasions. I was due to have another hospital appointment, which I had to cancel when seeing those two pink lines. Every time I went to the toilet I was worried I’d be confronted with the signs of another miscarriage occurring. And on New Year’s Eve while bucket shaking for Ava’s Fundit happened. There in front of me was the sign I’d been dreading and I had to leave the charitable event early.    I called my midwe and she booked me an appointment for an additional early scan on the nd January . Thankfully, the bleeding had been caused by a subchorionic hemorrhage and our baby was ok. I went on to have many scans throughout the pregnancy, constantly checking to make sure our baby was okay. Before reaching the halfway point, I found myself in hospital with suspected appendicitis. When this happened my only concern was for that of our baby, wanting to know whether they’d be able to operatenecessary andour baby would be okay. Thankfully the suspected appendicitis was a  alarm and everything was okay. At around  weeks pregnant when I was sat in the doctor’s surgery being prescribed antibiotics for an infection I asked whether they’d be able to listen in to my baby’s heartbeat.    I laid on the table for what felt like an eternity while they attempted to locate the beating sound which I longed to hear. After what felt like forever I saw the look on the doctor’s face as she said to the other doctor we need to call the hospital and arrange for this lady to have a scan. I burst into tears knowing that the last time I’d heard those words the scan confirmed our daughter’s heartbeat had stopped beating. We’d heard what no parent wants to hear, “I’m so sorry, there’s no heartbeat”. Thankfully in the very same moment, our little boy’s heartbeat was found but this didn’t help my anxiety as I was still terried that the heartbeat they had located could’ve been mine and that something was wrong. I asked whether I could have a scan so that I could see our baby alive on the screen but as the heartbeat had been located this wasn’t an option. I called the hospital directly to ask the same thing and again I was told that because I hadn’t had any bleeding and because his heartbeat had been heard there was no need for a scan. I remember leaving the doctor’s with tears running down my face I messaged my friend and she suggested some grounding techniques to help me calm down. Due to my anxiety being really bad my husband and I paid to have a private scan the following day. The scan took place at Babybond in Plymouth and the sonographer was amazing. He went above and beyond to show us everything in detail and let us know our baby boy was okay.

Lissie Harper, who married the hero cop just four weeks before his death, described him as a “gentle giant” and “positive force of nature”. PC Harper, , died after being dragged under a van while responding to reports of a burglary in Sulhamstead, Berkshire, in August. Hundreds of his Thames Valley Police colleagues lined the streets of Oxford as the funeral cortege passed through the city. More than  mourners, including Home Secretary Priti Patel, packed into Christ Church cathedral for the service.      Lissie, who attended the funeral with PC Harper’s parents and other relatives, placed his ceremonial hat on his coffin. Addressing her late husband in a moving eulogy, she described him as a “kind, brave and lovely man”. She said:From the ever sweet, lanky, red faced boy passing me notes in class, to the strong and loyal man you grew to be. I have always known how special you are.  “We often talked about how lucky we were to have found and kept each other. “True childhood sweethearts, loving one another more and more with each passing day. “Not a day went past that we didn’t say I love you. You used to tell me we were a team and we would get through all of le’s hurdles together. “How I wish you were here with me now. The hardest challenge of all is losing you.” She added: “Although Andrew was strong, he was also unfailingly kind, a gentle giant with a heart of gold.  “He wore his unorm with pride and vowed to challenge the bad and celebrate the good. “Andrew was everything, my breakfast buddy, my dancing partner, the love of my le. I will treasure every moment we had together. “He was my hero and his spirit will live on in my memories forever. “My lovely boy, I miss you more and more as the days pass into weeks, my love for you will never fade. “More than anything I wish that my most favourite person had not been taken so early, so cruelly, so unexpectedly. “If everyone on this earth had just an ounce of the kindness and generosity that Andrew had, I know that it would be a better place.” Rev Martyn Percy, the Dean of Christ Church, said Pc Harper “represented policing at its best”. He added: “He was everything you wanted in a police officer. Authentic, brave, genuine and kind.” Before the service his coffin was driven through the city as unormed officers and members of the public bowed their heads.  The procession was led by mounted officers from Thames Valley Police. His coffin, draped in a navy flag with police crest on the side, was carried into the cathedral by six colleagues. Henry Long, , from Reading, and two -year-old boys have been charged with PC Harper’s murder. They, along with Thomas King, , from Basingstoke, are also accused of conspiracy to steal a quad bike. The group is due to stand trial next year."},{"url":null,"title":"princess eugenie shares never before","story":"NewsPrincess Eugenie shares never-before-seen wedding party snaps - including Kate MiddletonPrincess Eugenie took to social media on her first anniversary of marrying hubby Jack Brooksbank, saying \"This was the greatest day of my le...forever and always\"ShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video princess-eugenie-posts-wedding-video-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news princess-eugenie-shares-never-before-\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The wet weather will trigger a considerable increase in slug pressure this autumn and winter, according to crop protection specialists Certis.The creatures can cause signicant damage to gardens and crops.However, outdoors experts at BillyOh has revealed the best ways to get rid of pesky molluscs without using pesticides. A spokesman told Devon Live : Slugs and snails probably cause the most devastation to gardens – they’ll think nothing of munching through your prettiest plants and ruining any vegetables you’ve lovingly grown.“Ideally, we’d all have the time to go around plucking each one by hand, but this can take a while – plus it’s pretty gross.    Instead, we’ve suggested nine alternative methods that will help you get rid of any slugs and snails in the garden, and then stop others from ing. The tips include deploying fruit and using rough surfaces.. Feed them citrus peelsSlugs love citrus, so don’t throw away your orange or lemon rinds. Instead put them in your garden to bait the slugs and snails away from your plants. In the morning, check your peels to seeany slugs or snails are on them, and remove these from your garden. Refresh with new peels as appropriate to continue your decoy operation.   . Deter with rough surfacesSlugs and snails hate crawling over scratchy surfaces, so try surrounding the stems of your plants with crushed eggshells or insert a sand-paper collar around the stem. Sprinkling sand around edges would work too. This won’t kill them, but it might slow them down and keep them off your plants.. CopperStrangely enough, research shows that slugs and snails cannot tolerate crawling on copper surfaces, which gives them a mild electrical shock when they crawl over it. So, put copper bands around your flowerpots or beds to deter them from crawling up and onto your plants. Pennies will work just as well too.. Herbal repellentsPlanting sage or mint around your garden plants will help deter slugs and snails. Other herbs and plants which may deter these critters include garlic, fennel, and even geraniums.. Coffee   Slugs and snails cannot tolerate caffeine, so you can deter them by placing coffee grounds around your plants.

You don’t like to change your centre-backs.“He has worked away and has probably trained for a longer period of time than he has here for a while.“That’s the big thing.

They were really dominant and in control and never looked in any pressure in the second half.”Meanwhile, the Dens gaffer hopes Declan McDaid’s double last week against the Red Lichties can give the former Ayr winger the “belief” to push on and add the goals he is capable of.“Declan has been great,” James added. “We’ve all given him a bit about not scoring because he’s great in training.“He’s positive, scores goals and takes people on. If you got our squad to pick three players that have to start every game I think most of them would pick Declan.“Going backwards for a forward player is great for the team defensively and he deserved those goals against Arbroath because they have been coming.“It’s about belief with him because he can be a match-winner and we need that.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/SNS-19531345-Scotland-v-San-Marino_33083184-760x564.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds super shankland hailed by fans as he scores in first scotland start","story":"Dundee United scoring sensation Lawrence Shankland has been hailed by football fans after scoring on his Scotland home debut.The Tannadice striker knocked in Scotland’s fourth goal at Hampden Park last night in a -

demolition of the world’s worst team San Marino.That came just days after earning his first cap in a - loss in Russia that killed any chance of qualying from the group.Now the Scots’ Euro  hopes hinge on the Nations League play-offs in March.Devlin said: “Between now and the next Scotland camp hopefully I will have shown the manager he can trust me at international level.“There are contributing factors to that as at club level I also need to be playing week in week out with Aberdeen.“All you can do is build a level of trust with the managerso he knows he can go and trust me to play.”Devlin was drafted into the starting line-up in Russia due to a centre-back injury crisis.He joined the Scotland squad having been dropped to the bench for Aberdeen for the -

That change was made after a - defeat to Rangers at Ibrox.Devlin said: “Thatprobably wasn’t ideal preparation.“However, I have to respect the Aberdeen manager in terms of his team selection because he knows what is best for the team.“I have got to work hard day on day to show I am improving and in the best shape possible for Aberdeen.“If that results in being called up to Scotland, then great.”Scotland brushed aside San Marino, the side rock bottom of the Fa world rankings, to move up to fourth in Group I. Devlin said: “We wanted to end the week on a high.“We had been really disappointed with the result in Russia but are delighted we can take positives from this.“Now we need to build momentum going into the next two games and hopefully this is the start of it.“Whenever you have a disappointment or a low you have to bounce back as quickly as possible to try to get that result and win under your belt.“That is what picks everyone up.“As disappointed as we were after Russia we had a big game to focus on against San Marino in our own stadium in front of our supporters.“They came in brilliant numbers to support us in Moscow and we wanted to try to send them home happy.“We were delighted with the six goals and to win the game.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

Given the challenges of sustaining a vibrant economy in this remote part of Scotland, the role of the dairy sector in Kintyre is fundamental to its success.#Our farmers are young, enthusiastic, committed to sustainability, investment and the next generation and have strong integrity – they are just the right group of people to secure this deal.#We have produced a great video which shows just why the Campbeltown Creamery is so pivotal to the area and why Mull of Kintyre cheddar is so important to Scotland and I encourage everyone to please support us by heading to the crowdfund website and spreading the word.#NFU Scotland Milk Committee Chairman John Smith commented: #This is a bold and inspiring bid from producers in Kintyre to preserve their creamery and to continue making world-famous, award-winning Mull of Kintyre cheddar.#These hard working family farms have built their businesses with a view to continuing to milk cows building and promoting the Mull of Kintyre brand locally and nationally and are looking positively to the future.#Dairy farmers in Kintyre have a fantastic story to tell,  producing high quality grass-fed milk in a beautul part of the country.  Funders will take the Mull of Kintyre brand to the next level by getting behind a cheese that has real provenance.#"},{"url":null,"title":"oban camanachd defeat seals relegation for inveraray","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsInveraray lost out to the Camanachd Cup finalists at Mossfield # a result which means the Royal Burgh side will be playing its shinty in the National Division next season.In goal for Inveraray for the match on Saturday October , Scott MacLachlan was on form and he denied Oban Camanachd#s Daniel MacCuish, Daniel MacVicar and Andrew MacCuish, before play switched to the other end and it was Inveraray who took the lead on  minutes.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

In turn, when additional contributions are considered, a further £.m is added.

An assiduous promoter of gender equality, Professor Belch pointed out that despite the wealth of opportunities open to women in medicine, when it comes to the most prestigious areas, such as heart surgery, men are still top dog.ldquoThese are jobs where you may be required to work from six in the morning to  at night, she said, ldquoand most women decided that they prefer to work part-time rather than commit to that. Not that she blames them: ldquoAfter all, we fought for their right to choose.Part-time employment is now the main obstacle in the campaign for women to be on a par with men. When a female doctor first hooks a stethoscope around her neck the future looks,not precisely plain sailing, then navigable.However,at some point she starts a family, or has older relatives to care for, opting to work part-time creates an unsolvable quandary. You could call the shorter working week a womanrsquos wrecking ball, the destroyer of youthful aspirations.Speak to thirtysomething medics, who started out intending to become heroic surgeons and physicians, and you will detect a weariness, and also a resignation to the fact that the conditions in which they are expected to perform are incompatible with any kind of normal le, let alone raising a family.As a result, an essential tier of the health system voluntarily removes itself from the full-time rota. And while hospital-based medicine is undoubtedly at the extreme end of professional expectations, given the prolonged, intense and erratic shts, what goes for medicine is also true of other careers: the advocate who must work into the small hours and over weekends to keep on top of her case load the head teacher who is in the school before breakfast, and once back home works until bedtime the farmer who labours every day of the year the journalist who cannot clock off until the late-breaking story is filed.No wonder people in these occupations wondertheyrsquove been put on the rack, as they are slowly stretched to breaking point. Yet when doctors, and other high-fliers, decide to go part-time, it is a self-inflicted slow puncture. All the training, expertise and experience they have acquired, all the momentum they have gathered, begins to deflate. Friends and family feel secretly disappointed that a seemingly stellar career has lost its stardust. Worse, the part-timer often feels she is in some unfathomable way to blame for not being able to juggle everybodyrsquos expectations, including her own, yet still have a le worth living.By drawing attention to the part-time glass ceiling, Professor Belch highlights how complicated and protracted the business of reaching true equality remains. The effort to increase the number of women entering medical school, which was once seen as the solution to the predominance of males, succeeded years ago. Indeed, that hurdle has been so successfully overcome there are sometimes more girls in class than boys.The problem is that, in the early years of feminism, none of us looked far enough ahead. Lacking imagination, perhaps, or brimming with optimism, we did not give a thought to the lelong path ndash more accurately a tight-rope ndash on which working women must keep their balance. Once aloft, they need to stay upright not merely when they are young and full of energy, but as their lestyles change, their commitments grow, and their attitudes mature.Belchrsquos comments are a long overdue corrective to the notion that the ward ndash or boardroom, laboratory, lecture hall ndash is as welcoming for women as men. In so doing she has also pointed to the unrealistically tough regime in which many professionals are expected to survive. Itrsquos not just women who have a family to raise, or other caring responsibilities, and itrsquos not just women who feel they must clone themselves in order to get through everything the working day ndash and the action-packed weekend ndash demands. Singletons, or those with partners but no children, can still find employersrsquo expectations excessive and debilitating. The dedication and single-eyed focus required to keep on top of the most responsible roles takes a toll on everyone.Doubtless burn-out existed in Edwardian times, it just didnrsquot have a label. Today we have inherited a pitiless culture in which status is calculated by how visibly gruelling your job is. The more punishing your hours and the less time you have at home, the higher your place on the ladder of awe. The employee who can be home shortly after five, and has all evening in which to help their kids with homework or go to the gym, is unlikely to score impressively on the Richter scale of professional achievement. Yet she, or he, might have a really well thought-out le, with their priorities in the right order.The dilemma facing society is not simply how to help part-time women reach the very top but how to recalibrate these Alpha workplaces. The challenge for employers who do not want talented staff to drt off or grow disheartened is to come up with ways to make these all-consuming roles desirable, but also manageable, for a far wider range of iniduals.At the moment, physical and psychological stamina are almost as essential as professional excellence for someone to thrive in such an environment. Yet how many does that automatically exclude  Instead of a place that resembles the trenches, we need to restructure hospitals, banks, or the courts, so that they properly value ambitious and able part-timers. Far from discriminating against their promotion, they should encourage it. A good place to start might be to banish the adjective ldquopart-time, and its belittling connotations, once and for all."},{"url":null,"title":"wild-camping-bid-ban-tents-scotlands-beauty-spots","story":"But now, wild campers could find themselves barred from pitching up at certain spots and forced to use designated campsites after concerns about a rise in litter and antisocial behaviour.The Scottish Parliament is being asked to consider new legislation which would enable councils to prevent wild camping in areas regarded as inappropriate or particularly sensitive areas after a surge in problems along the popular North Coast  route.It comes amid rising concern over the mess some wild campers leave behind, including toilet waste, broken bottles and litter, plus their environmental impact ndash from damage to fragile landscapes caused by tyre tracks to chemical spillages.In some cases, wild campers have been accused of chopping down trees to start campfires which in turn raises the risk of wildfires, parking their vehicles overnight on blind corners or in single-track road passing places, and scorching grass with camper van cleaning chemicals.:Outdoors: Five great botanical gardens to visitHuman faeces left by wild campers has been found in picturesque spots such as Balnakeil Beach near Durness and even in a church graveyard.Now a petition launched by Highland SNP councillor Kirsteen Currie suggests legislation is needed to allow councils to create ldquono wild camping zones in order to protect the environment and infrastructure.She said the problem rests with a particular group of travellers who fail to respect the places they visit and can be aggressive when challenged.She said: ldquoPeople causing problems by roadside camping in really inappropriate, selfish places are not your lsquoput on gaiters and go for a nice walk Munro-baggersrsquo. Theyrsquore not hillwalking and outside types.ldquoThey are people who donrsquot want to spend pound or pound to use a campsite. And when someone challenges them ndash such as someone I know who asked a family to pick up dirty nappies they had left behind on a beach ndash they are met with aggression.ldquoAnd it doesnrsquot matter how many Countryside Code leaflets you print out, they are not reading them. I donrsquot want to impinge on anyonersquos rights to roam, I want to stop people having the right to make a mess.The petition says the impact of wild camping, particularly on the NC route, has been ldquoconsiderable and adds it has become ldquoexceptionally problematic for local authorities and public bodies to deal with and at great expense to the public purse.:Herald Entrepreneur: Hone your vision so you have a strong foundation from which to build your businessIt points out that the problem isnrsquot restricted to the areas which line the NC route, with complaints about the impact of wild campers emerging from the Western Isles and other Scottish tourist hotspots across the country.In it, Currie adds: ldquoInformal encouragement has not been sufficient to stop the degradation of our infrastructure and environment.ldquoEven with an increased focus on responsible camping from public authorities and the NC organisation, the situation appears to be getting worse rather than better.ldquoThe route of the NC is becoming totally unsuitable for small rural communities in the north of Scotland.The NC tourist trail has been credited with transforming tourism to Scotlandrsquos northwest coast since its launch in .Most travellers opt to start at Inverness and take in a -mile loop around the northern tip of the mainland, before eventually ing to the Highland capital.Part of its charm is the long distances travellers can cover without encountering the distractions of modern le, around one-fth of it on narrow, single-track roads.With accommodation limited to small BBs, inns and hotels, many visitors opt to travel the route in campervans or with tents for camping under the stars.But while the route is said to have added at least pound million to the regionrsquos economy and brought over , visitors, people living in the area have become increasingly outspoken over the impact of tourism on their fragile environment.Wild camping is legal in Scotland. However, campers are expected to stick to the Scottish Outdoor Access Code which suggests it should involve camping for just two or three nights at a time and be ldquolightweight, with small numbers of people and no trace left on the natural surroundings.According to the Holyrood petition, no camping zones would allow local authorities to encourage responsible tourism and encourage campers to use campsites and their facilities to dispose of waste properly.It could see camping banned at increasingly popular wild camping sites near cities in areas such as Ayrshire, West Dunbartonshire, Fe, East Lothian and Aberdeenshire.The petition does not set out to ban wild camping entirely, just from areas close to roadsides which are becoming overwhelmed with campers.Wild camping has already been outlawed around parts of Loch Lomond.But there are concerns about how stringently councils will impose the no camping rules which could affect mountaineers and walkers who want to pitch a tent during overnight expeditions.Responses to the online petition have included comments which support the call and highlight inidual problem areas. One claims that campervans park within  metres of a campsite in Tongue rather than use its facilities, while another said simply: ldquoDone seeing bins overflowing in the middle of nowhere and people having a lsquonumber tworsquo outside their camping site.Another wrote: ldquoHaving visited the south side of Loch Tummel for nearly  years it has been devastating to witness the rubbish people leave behind when wild camping.ldquoSome of my favourite walking spots are now no-go areas due to human waste and view spots are ruined by rubbish.Others, however, spoke out against the idea of legislation with one commenting: ldquoEroding the rights of all citizens is not the answer.Another said: ldquoImposing complete bans totally ruins it for those acting responsibly and goes against everything the current outdoor access code stands for.Helen Todd, Ramblers Scotlandrsquos campaigns and policy manager, said: ldquoSadly there are ongoing issues in hotspot areas with an antisocial minority who are damaging the environment, the reputation of campers and the outdoor experience for everyone who loves our countryside.ldquoThe entire outdoor community shares the frustration of residents about these people, whose selfish actions impact upon communities, landscapes and the thousands of responsible people who enjoy camping away from formal sites across Scotland.ldquoWe are calling for antisocial camping to be tackled through stronger enforcement of the existing laws, provision of facilities and more low-cost campsites, and investment in education on responsible access ndash rather than new costly and ineffective laws or by-laws, which themselves would need enforced.ldquoIn many instances, responsible roadside camping away from houses is legal, legitimate and simply the best option.ldquoFor example, winter climbers arriving late ahead of a pre-dawn start, cycle tourers, disabled campers who benefit from being near their car, canoeists and anglers at road-circled lochs and long-distance walkers.She added: ldquoRather than banning campers, the best solution is to try out ious visitor management measures, such as investment in infrastructure like low-cost campsites, toilets and litter bins, and lots of education. This should be monitored and adjusted as time goes on to find out what works best.ldquoIn addition, enforcement of existing legislation like breach of the peace, vandalism and littering can be carried out by the police in areas known to be hotspots.ldquoI donrsquot think anyone involved with setting up NC expected it to be as spectacular a success story in terms of numbers, but the infrastructure is not there. They put the cart before the horse. A lot of public money was spent marketing this route but there was a failure to provide an effective infrastructure for anyone using it.A spokesman for North Coast  said: ldquoLitter is a problem associated with most human activities and it should be recognised that residents are as likely to be responsible as visitors for negligent waste disposal.

and behaviour.They are accompanied by amateur footage capturing women sharing a laugh or caring for family, and government propaganda and war-time film.The woman range from crofters to campaigners, schoolgirls to factory workers carrying out duties amid grime and fish workers, some little more than -years-old who have left their family home to work in stinking processing yards in the south of England.Dr Emily Munro, Her Century curator and Learning and Outreach Officer for the National Library of Scotland, said the collection of films, which were screened in their entirety at the Macrobert Centre in Stirling yesterday, reflect a time of rapid social change, when a \"womanrsquos place\" was increasingly contested and redefined.ldquoItrsquos as much about what wersquore missing from the films as what we can see in them, she said.ldquoWe can see from the films that some things have changed for the better, but that there are also some things we have lost, such as traditional industries which were often were women worked.ldquoI wanted something that is celebratory and positive about women, but also that raises questions for people.Among the earliest films to feature in the project is a  film Herring Harvest at Yarmouth, showing lsquoScotch lassiesrsquo at work some  miles from home.ldquoSome of the girls were just  or  years old, added Dr Munro, ldquobut would have left home and travelled all that way because that was where the work was.Other films focus on clippies and domestic science lessons, biscuit factory workers at Macfarlane Langrsquos Glasgow factory making Rich Tea and cream crackers and women making rles at a furniture makers workshop during the Second World War, and inspiring  silent footage of Winnie Drinkwater, a pilot and aviation pioneer.In contrast is a  Scottish Health Education Unit film, Male and Female, made by Jewish-Indian film-maker Sara Erulker and intended to be shown to teenagers as part of a series aimed at guiding them into adulthood.ldquoIt was meant to be open-ended and not prescriptive which is quite fascinating in itself, and addressed issues in teenagersrsquo lives such as sexual relationship, drunkenness, and gender expectations, said Dr Munro.ldquoMale and Female is a fascinating film some of the views the teenagersrsquo have are quite progressive and others are quite conservative.ldquoThe reflects the moment in time, where new freedoms and possibilities were emerging but also there was political conservatism.ldquoThe film was made in Glasgow and featured local teenagers, so it would be particularly interesting to find out what happened to them.While some of the films have been made by women, they rarely reflect strong feminist views. However, one film made by two women from Sheffield Film Co-operative in , Red Skirts on Clydeside, does examine of the most celebrated of womenrsquos battles - the Glasgow Rent Strikes of , told through the voices of the women descendants.ldquoItrsquos interesting that this film wasnrsquot made by women who lived in Scotland ndash or even men in Scotland, adds Dr Munro. ldquoItrsquos almost aswe were ambivalent about our own social political history as far as women were concerned.ldquoThe film poses important questions about why womenrsquos history is so hidden, and where can you go to hear about it.While some films show women taking on male roles during the Second World War, another highlights the impact of women lsquohaving it allrsquo and urges communities to come together to support vulnerable children left at home while women go to work.Dr Munro says taken together, the films spotlight the great iation in womenrsquos roles over the period, and draw on the iety of ways in which women and girls are represented on film, as scholars, workers, mothers and friends.The Her Century programme is being accompanied by a lsquozinersquo featuring women writers exploring the experiences, identities and perspectives of young women and girls.Sambrooke Scott, Film Hub Scotland Manager said: ldquoWersquore delighted that Her Century is screening across the breadth of the Film Hub Scotland network, from the Isle of Tiree to St Andrews, over the next six months until International Womenrsquos Day in March . Wersquore dedicated to bringing archive film to audiences across Scotland and collaborating with partners Her Century has the power to spark important discussions about equality that we can all contribute to."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-tranquility-plocktons-place","story":"Plockton, is the harbour community in Wester Ross famed as the location for the fictional ldquobeat of s TV policeman Hamish Macbeth, starring Robert Carlyle and was the setting for parts of the  horror film The Wicker Man.Now the village, which benefits from the warming effects of the North Atlantic Drt, and is a magnet for holidaymakers with its array of brightly painted cottages has been ranked as the most tranquil getaway in the UK.:Highland Collective on a mission to photograph the glories of ScotlandThe village got the highest overall score of . out of , in an analysis gained from a shortlist of  UK destinations.Taking into account population size, remoteness, number of rentable cottages and how often they are referenced as lsquobeautulrsquo online, the villages and towns that were considered were said to be the ldquoperfect remedy for those wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle.Seven of the top , featured in the campaign were in Scotland, with Plockton the cream of the crop and described as ldquothe UKrsquos ultimate tranquil haven.The research, carried out by furniture design firm Arlo and Jacob, said of Plockton: ldquoVisited by tourists each year for its picturesque seaside setting surrounded by hills, this quaint location is home to a population of just  people, the second-lowest of all destinations analysed.The village, which was developed as a herring port in the early th century is now a haven for summer visitors including artists and yachtsmen.ldquoDespite its staggeringly low population, Plockton holds the th highest number of rentable cottages at  and is  miles away from the nearest major city, making it the ultimate tranquil getaway for those wanting a break from the busyness of everyday le, said the research.Timothy Newsome, marketing director from Arlo  Jacob said: ldquoItrsquos really important to take time for ourselves to relax and get away from our daily routines, no matter how hard it may seem.

They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Nicola Sturgeon: the Scottish Parliament’s greatest achievements viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

It neither meets the needs of the local community nor the standards people in Orkney have a right to expect from their leline service.“I have raised these concerns with the First Minister and Transport Secretary in the past, highlighting the impact on constituents. I was given assurances that it would be addressed in the new contract.“Given the announcement that Serco Northlink has been chosen as the preferred bidder, it is important that the Scottish Government now claries what the arrangements will be for the forthcoming refit period.#The new contract needs to address the failings of the current contract and ensure that this leline route is served during the refit period by a vessel that is fit for purpose”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Of the  species assessed in Scotland,  per cent were classied as threatened with extinction from Scotland.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself.

The two businessmen confirmed that the Wrightbus factory has been saved from liquidation with Jo Bamford as the new owner of the business.“Mr Bamford’s firm will acquire the entire premises at Galgorm including the factory, fixtures and fittings as well as the associated land.“Commenting on the purchase agreement and wishing Mr Bamford every success Mr Wright confirmed that he had gted  acres of family owned farmland to Mid and East Antrim Council by way of a legacy for the people of Ballymena in recognition of their contribution over  years to the service of Wrightbus.”In a personal statement, Mr Wright said: “This legacy gt is a tribute not only to my father, his father before him, and the Wright family members but most importantly it is a tribute to the generations of workers who helped build a proud manufacturing tradition in Ballymena. It is my true wish to see this legacy used for the purposes of expanding manufacturing and benefiting our local community.“The Chief Executive of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council indicated, during discussions in September, that the Wrightbus legacy lands will be used for a landmark project. In the last few days it was confirmed that the Council’s poundm iC innovation Centre could be located on the site.“This will provide manufacturing start-up space and alongside the legacy lands from JTI and Michelin help Council advance their bid to collocate a Queens University led Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Centre. I believe the presence of this centre on the Wrightbus legacy land will send a clear message to Northern Ireland and beyond that Ballymena has a strong future in advanced manufacturing.” The statement added that Mid and East Antrim Borough Council “estimates that the legacy of the site and the new investment would result in , jobs with the potential to rebuild Ballymena”.It stated: “It is also has ambitious plans to secure one of the ‘Heathrow Hubs’ for the town which would see a further , engineering and manufacturing jobs for the area.

In the absence of Stormont the Permanent Secretary Noel Lavery needs to step up to the plate and ensure that both outgoing Invest NI CEO Alistair Hamilton and his replacement Kevin Holland leave no stone unturned in the quest to safeguard the future of this workforce. The reality is thatthis was a start up foreign investor everything would be done to ensure its success. This deal offers a new company, effectively a start up and all support that can be given should be given, Mr Thompson said.Yesterday afternoon, Jeff Wright i ssued a statement saying the failure to complete a deal lay with industrialist Jo Bamford.This was after Mr. Bamford had stated he had been asked for a ‘signicantly larger sum’ in relation to the deal.Mr. Wright’s statement read: “The facts of the matters are as follows - Mr. Bamford was advised on Friday, October  that any deal would include the entire premises at Galgorm including the factory, fixtures and fittings.“These were available for lease or purchase. Mr Bamford sought to gain unrelated additional farmlands which were not for sale. It is important to note that no other bidder sought at any time to link the farmlands to the business purchase.“Mr. Bamford, as his statement confirms, did not deal with these matters until am this morning. In his response he insisted he would not proceed with the deal unless the farmlands were included.“Mr. Wright does not recognise the explanation provided by Mr. Bamford as to why he failed to conclude the purchase of the business.Earlier on Thursday, Mr. Bamford had issued his own statement of clarication, saying:  “At am this morning I made an offer to the Wright family to match the asking price for the Wrightbus factory and land. “This includes a sum to match the amount that the factory and associated land was purchased for two years ago from JTI. “Mr Wright has since refused this offer and has now asked for a signicantly higher sum of money.

He fought for the British title in Oldham, but was unfortunately beaten.It was following this defeat that Ken’s le took a turn for the worse. On medical advice, Ken quit kickboxing but, with a strong desire to stay active, he turned his attention towards bodybuilding.It was at this point Ken began injecting anabolic steroids and gained employment as a nightclub doorman.Recalling this period of his le Ken said: “I was introduced to everything including ecstasy, LSD, cannabis and cocaine. I also became very dependent on alcohol and as a result lost everything, twice.”He continued: “The first time I lost my house, I had to register homeless in order to secure another, which I subsequently lost. I didn’t sleep on the street that often, I slept in my car, but most nights were spent in friend’s houses where the drinking and drug taking continued.”This party lestyle played havoc with Ken’s health and he was given a stark reminder of the fragility of le after falling asleep outside in the snow one night.Ken developed pneumonia and was very ill for three months. Despite this illness and a deep depression that had developed as a result of the drug abuse, Ken continued to get high.Unsurprisingly, things got worse before they get better.Ken explained: “I went on a drink and drugs spree from Friday night to Sunday morning, I remember it was a very bright Sunday morning and as I walked up the Shore Road in Belfast, high on drugs, I collapsed.I don’t know how I got to my friend’s house but coming round in their front room is the next thing I remember,”Thankfully for Ken a family, who happened to be Christians, witnessed his exploits on the Shore Road that morning, praying hard for him and offered him help.Ken recalls: “I wasn’t keen on going to church but was brought to the Whitewell politan Tabernacle, before I knew it, I was blessed.“Pastor McConnell preached with a fire and passion and, his sermon, ‘Obstacles God Puts On The Sinners Road To Stop Them Going To Hell’ really resonated with me. That night, whilst looking at the cross I saw Christ die in my place.” F.E.

I still faced lots of desires and temptations, but God got me through them and I had a growing desire for more God in my le.“I was out all the time wanting to be where people were praising the Lord.In  I met my we Allison in the Craigavon Civic Centre at a Cleft meeting and  months later we were married. In  I was asked to be a missionary in an orphanage in a village near Timisoara, Romania. Later that year we were asked to become full-time missionaries. I hadn’t been saved for that long and for one reason or another, it didn’t work out.”Upon his , Ken travelled from Belfast to Dublin every Tuesday night, with Pastor James McConnell for faith rallies.Two years later, Ken was asked to assume responsibility for the rallies. He was ordained the day after his second daughter was born on September , .Following his ordination, Ken spoke at any pulpit that wanted him. He was tasked with taking over Donaghcloney Elim in August  and has turned the church around.At the time Ken took over, there were only  people regularly attending and the church was facing closure.However, following Ken’s arrival the church has been rejuvenated and can now boast of a -strong congregation.“We have always had a steady following of faithful older people, but now we have a thriving congregation full of families and host many groups for all ages, including a Sunday School, youth club on Thursday nights and a ladies meeting on the first Wednesday of every month.

Work was due to begin on the £.million project in August, but campaigners had occupied the green for over  days in a bid to block the development. Since , Friends of Glassmullin Open Greenhave campaigned against the facility, which is funded by Education NI for De La Salle College.In recent days, however, through consultation and engagement, the school and local community representatives have reached an agreement that will pave the way for the new G pitch. Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community. We are excited to see the project come to fruition and are looking forward to participating and working with the newly formed committee to ensure community cohesion.#Construction of the facility is due to start imminently partnered with ongoing engagement across residents and interest groups via the newly formed joint committee."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"blessed trinity students set for south africa","story":"NINE Year  students from Blessed Trinity College are preparing for the trip of a letime to South Africa.The young people have teamed up with Paddy Doyle from New Lodge Youth Centre and the Connections Youth Project.They will travel to South Africa on October  to spend  days working on a number of dferent projects in Durban and the surrounding towns and villages before ing home on November .This is the first time the project has been run with a school and Bernadette Little, Vice-Principal of Blessed Trinity College Antrim Road site, is delighted with the upcoming opportunity for the students.“We are happy and privileged to have been asked to come on board the project,” she explained.“We ran an internal application process open to all students and there was a lot of interest,” she said. “They then went for an interview to sell their qualities and skills before the final nine were chosen. There has been a lot of work done already with a lot of preparation and education about culture in South Africa.“It is once in a letime opportunity and will give the students more of a clear direction of what they want to do in le when they come back.”Student Ryan McCarthy explained more about what the trip will entail.“We had to do a lot of fundraising which involved bag packing and setting up pages on Facebook to raise the £, required for cover our travel and donate towards dferent projects out there,” he said. “The first seven days we will spend in homeless shelters before moving to work in villages and towns outside Durban. We will be fully integrated in the community and there will be no luxuries.“We will live with local people and their families and help build houses and other things to help the community and work on dferent projects.“It will be very much a hands-on experience. It is not a holiday for us. We have also been learning the Zulu culture which is everything from song, language, games and dance, which we will use to communicate with the children who don’t speak much English. We want to respect their culture and integrate ourselves into theirs.”Another student, Holly O’Neill, believes she will take a lot from the experience.“I think the trip will teach us a lot about how we take for granted how we live back at home,” she said. “These people in South Africa are poor. We will feel lucky to live here. People complain about all the bad stuff in the news here but it is nothing compared to over there. People have nothing compared to us. The whole experience so far has given us all more confidence. We were all shy and didn’t talk much to each other but now we are all talking more and working together as a team.“The travel is daunting – around  hours – but we are all looking forward to it and want to make the most out of it. I remember the feeling when I got picked for this le changing experience, I was speechless.“The amount of dedication that has to be put in is crazy, but working as a team I know we can get through it.“Something that has really been outstanding for me has definitely been the Monday night groups that I look forward to for a good laugh and good craic.“I’m just so thankful to have been chosen for this le changing experience.”Paddy Doyle from Connections Youth Project added: “I wanted to change the project a bit and develop young leaders within a school environment.“The young people have worked really hard in their preparation so far and I know we are going to have a successful trip. I can’t wait for it. It is a new programme for me as well but it will create a lot of memories and experiences for the young people.”You can keep up to date with the young people’s journey in South Africa on the Connections Youth Project Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"neurology waiting lists a disgrace","story":"ALLIANCE Health spokesperson Paula Bradshaw has branded the latest neurology waiting lists “a disgrace” and warned they are the latest example of people paying for others’ political irresponsibility.The South Belfast MLA was speaking after it was revealed the number of people waiting for a first neurology outpatient appointment here has more than doubled in the past four years.More than , patients have also been waiting more than one year to be seen.“The doubling of waiting lists in the past four years is the latest example of the Health Service descending into a two-tier system, with those who can afford it getting quick diagnoses and treatment while others are left to their anxiety about what is wrong for over a year. This is now a dysal system,” she said.“At the heart of this is the refusal of those with the biggest mandates to take the responsibility for governing which comes with those mandates. They know well a deal has long been available but decisions which are unpopular in the short term will need to be made for the long-term good of the healthcare system and public health.“We must never stop being shocked by figures such as these, which are unacceptable and show a decline in planning for the future, going back many years. It is time for comprehensive transformation or there simply will not be a public health service for the next generation # and it is time those with the big mandates took responsibility for delivery of it.”SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon called the waiting times for a first neurology outpatient appointment “unacceptable”.The North Belfast MLA said that staff are working tirelessly to manage demand while also coping with the biggest patient recall in history. “Neurology patients, people living with conditions like Parkinson’s disease, Motor Neurone disease or multiple sclerosis, should not be forced to endure the pain, worry and uncertainty of waiting over a year to be seen,” she said. “That’s the cruel reality for over , people who understand the seriousness of their condition and desperately want to be seen and treated as quickly as possible.“These patients and the staff working in neurology units deserve better. Aside from the immense challenge of having almost , people on the neurology waiting list, doctors and nurses are trying their best to cope with the biggest patient recall in our history. It must feel overwhelming.“We have had reviews of neurology services before. I have no doubt that the final report will reach similar conclusions with similar recommendations. They cannot be allowed to sit on a shelf gathering dust while real people suffer on hospital waiting lists. This is a scandal and we all have to commit to addressing it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the great outdoors at a local nursery school","story":"AIDAN Crean fully understands young people’s concern for nature and the future of our planet – in fact the west Belfast environmental supremo ‘got it’ well before anyone  did.When he was young and with the Troubles raging all around, nature and the environment weren’t high on many people’s list of priorities. But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature. Five years later, his father was killed by a British army Saracen in a crash on the Falls Road.“Those binoculars launched me on the journey that I’m still enjoying. And I hope this eco garden will have the same effect by inspiring the next generation of youngsters,” he said."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38573258.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_109142883_constabledowney.jpg","title":"10k for psni officer discriminated against","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

clean-shaven.He later brought an employment tribunal case against then-Chief Constable George Hamilton claiming he had been discriminated against, a view which was supported by an employment tribunal.The PSNI has said it is aware of the tribunals findings and said it is currently examining the detail.Speaking to BBC News NI, Constable Downey said: \"To be turfed out of the unit, with little or no notice, for refusal to shave off a moustache, which doesnt affect the equipment Ive been issued with, is total madness.\"Read MoreMoustache would have to be a ‘belter’ to impair PSNI

implemented in  for some units in the PSNI due to health and safety concerns.The updated policy required these officers to \"remain clean shaven whilst on duty\" for health and safety reasons.The case centred over whether respiratory masks used in certain police units, and which are supposed to be airtight, can be used safelythe officer has facial hair.Expert advice to the tribunal  previously claimed men would need \"a moustache like a walrus\" for the equipment not to work properly.\"The policy itself was being enforced against men under health and safety grounds, and yet females within our unit had hair in contravention of the same policy, not facial hair but head hair, where there was a grab risk,\" Constable Downey said.\"So the policy was being enforced against men and not against female officers.\"Constable Downey said he tried to accommodate the policy by shaving his beard to a moustache but was also asked to remove that.\"As an older person with a receding hairline and alopecia who is slightly overweight all I can do is grow a bit of fur on my top lip, and to have that removed for absolutely no reason is wrong,\" he said.The unanimous decision of the tribunal was that Constable Downey was discriminated against contrary to the Sex DiscriminationOrder .He was awarded over £, for hurt feelings and loss of earnings.Niall McMullan from Worthingtons SolicitorsNiall McMullan from Worthingtons Solicitors, who represented Constable Downey, said it was an important ruling.\"This is a signicant ruling by the industrial tribunal, because it has essentially declared that the current PSNI policy is discriminating indirectly against males, in as far as the application of the policy is concerned,\" he said.\"I would like to see serious steps taken by the PSNI in relation to this decision.\"The tribunal were unequivocal in so far as they want the PSNI to review this decision and to ensure it has a less discriminatory effect on not just my

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

I still have nightmares about it - even now.\"As Aimees anxiety deepened, so too did her desire to shut herself indoors.\"I didnt want to leave the house,\" says Aimee, who now has two children - Lilyand Jack- with businessman husband Matthew Oliver .\"I was afraid of Lily crying in public, I didnt want to be out somewhere that I had to feed her so I always fed her in the house and quickly went out.\"On top of the cafe incident I couldnt really exercise because Matthew doesnt have a nine-to-five job and I never really knew when he would be home. \"I really started to struggle even more because exercise has always been my release.\"So I was struggling with my mental health and I was also struggling to find something exercise-related where mums could bring babies - or even find support for mums wanting to exercise.\"Then, one day, I sat down and put pen to paper and started designing the programme - and four years later here I am.\"Bodyfit Mums specialises in six-week post-natal fitness programmes comprising both studio and home-based elements - and children are allowed to come.\"Its a gradual process, theyre not thrown in at the deep end,\" says Aimee, whos been in the fitness industry for  years. \"You dont have to bring your children with you but you have that option. Most of the time babies are in their prams or car seats and I have big mats and play tents for toddlers.\"Ive never actually had a day when Ive thought, This is a really bad idea. Its really weird - it just works.\"Half the time Im pushing prams while feedinga bottle while coaching... we all help each other out. And its not just for new mums.\"Over the past four years, hundreds of women have passed through former leguard Aimees programmes which she runs out of One Fitness in Lisburn and Portadown - and shes currently looking for premises in Belfast.\"Its eight mums per group - its not too big, you still get that one-to-one feeling, but there are enough people so they feel like theyre part of a community,\" she says.\"Thats what its all about. I put them into their own group chat at the start of the six weeks and I still have group chats going from over two-and-a-half years ago.\"Its not necessarily all about fitness - more about whos trying what type of gin,\" she laughs.She also plans to launch a prenatal fitness programme next year.Having turned her own mental ill-health into a successful business, Aimee says shes met many other mums whove been struggling to cope with the demands of motherhood.\"One in five mums in Northern Ireland will be diagnosed with a perinatal mental health issue,\" she says.\"Despite this, a staggering % of parents have no access to specialist services and therefore must rely on community services for support.\"Northern Ireland is the only region in the UK which doesnt have access to funding for perinatal mental health charities and thats where the Sisterhood Soiree fundraiser, due to take place on October  at Belfasts Wellington Park Hotel, comes in.\"Im running the fundraising event because Ive noticed that some mums are struggling with depression and anxiety,\" she says.\"Ive had mums sitting in a car park for an hour with me thinking they havent been able to make it, but its because they cant actually get out of the car...\"Indeed, because \"there are a lot of mental health issues going on\" Aimee felt the need to reach out to the two charities. \"We Are Pangs NI deals with the perinatal side of things and Birthwise is focused on helping developing the services for parents in Northern Ireland,\" she says.\"Together we will try to provide Northern Ireland mothers with some of the support they desperately need.\"BBC journalist Wendy Austin said shes looking forward to her role as compere at the Soiree.She revealed that her own daughter Kerry, and her sons Austinand Ellis , are class regulars.\"Kerry has been going since the programme started and is now an instructor - she and my grandsons love it,\" Wendy says.\"Im very happy to support Aimee, We Are Pangs NI and Birthwise - I just wish Aimee would run some classes to produce bodyfit grans.\"Author Michelle Bradley, who set up the perinatal health charity We Are Pangs, explains that \"its all about mums supporting mums\".She adds: \"Thats why I love it. Its incredible that Aimee has decided to do this fundraiser. Northern Ireland does not invest any money at all in perinatal services and thats why were trying to roll out a peer support network.\"The Sisterhood Soiree charity night with a fashion show, pop-up stalls and DJ to help you dance the night away, takes place on Saturday, October  at Wellington Park Hotel, Belfast.There will be a raffle on the night with prizes donated by businesses including the Bullitt Hotel, The Merchant Hotel and Belfast personality and former model Orlaith McAllister.

Foryou know who should hear ya, you know what youd get..pushThose lyrics kept repeating in my head after the summit between An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar and British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. Nobody was saying much about anything.And the chorus wasnt much better. Take the words of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith, on the meeting: \" I am not going into the details of the negotiations.\" Then Micheal Martin. Leader of Fianna Fail: \" The less said in public, the better!\" And the Taoiseach, in rare harmony, said: \"I wont be going into detail as its sensitive. When in discussions, the less said, the better.\" Read MoreDUP warns PM it wont back any deal that traps us in EUSuzanne Breen: The national embarrassment, everyone agrees we deserve better but no one has the guts to change things Of course, they are talking about Brexit deadlines, deals and the orce that dare not speak its name.In fairness, the mood music around the Merseyside summit was good.

The key is whether both parties feel the same way the morning after the night before.The format of the day was unusual. Meetings occurred between the British and Irish teams, then reduced down to handful of key advisors and both Prime Ministers. This was followed by a brisk walk and some couple time for the two leaders.Much can be lost in translation from such a format. Understandings and undertakings may become blurred. Could it all be a charm offensive to prepare for the blame game  Maybe, but I think not. Johnson needs a deal. As does Leo. And so does Northern Ireland.The morning after and the goodwill seems to have prevailed all the way to Brussels for the meeting between Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, and EU Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.The semi news block out is necessary. All too often, careless talk, sniping briefings and megaphone diplomacy has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.This is not the time to allow the futures of two neighbouring countries, who have joint stewardship of the problem child - Northern Ireland - to have their negotiations dissected and pulled apart by Twitter trolls, jumped up bovver boys, madcap lefties and right wing loonies.There will be nervousness within the DUP ranks. Further pragmatism may be required.They should face up to this because such pragmatism will not change the constitutional position of NI within the UK.It will demonstrate maturity and it delivers on the joint Executive Letter of August , signed by Arlene Foster and the late Martin McGuinness and their stated desire for a soft landing for NI post Brexit.Being mature, leading from the front and not bowing to the lowest common denominator in loyalism would do much to restore the cross-community credibility the DUP lost during the past , days.Johnsons electoral success depends on delivering a Brexit which is recognised as such by voters in Britain. If there is a ranking order for his priorities, it is wherever his votes are. They are not in Northern Ireland, as the Tories hardly register on the Richter scale.The alignment of some in the DUP to the Brexit Party is like hitching a lt on a Catherine wheel, momentarily exciting, all sparks, only to fizzle out like a damp squib.Farage never looks like a man who wants a full-time political job. Post Brexit, his party will disintegrate, as did its predecessor, UKIP.Sinn Feins leadership has been unusually quiet. Mary Lou gave a cautious welcome to the news there was positive vibes coming from the Anglo-Irish summit.When a Brexit deal didnt look at all possible, some in Sinn Fein hoped a crash out of the EU would lead to the type of chaos which would anger nationalist voters. Thus giving a timely lt to a party languishing in the polls in the Republic.The campaign to have a border poll will also stallJohnsons government can pull off the elusive deal.However, the idea of a bespoke NI referendum on the customs union or back stop is a real possibility. That said, every election in Northern Ireland is a quasi border poll.The Tories will never concede on a border poll whilst in hoc to the DUP. The momentum has, for the time being, left any prospect for a border poll years away. Unionists should take comfort in that, too.Deal or no deal - Sinn Fein probably thought they could still make electoral advantage from either outcome.If, and its a huge , a no-deal Brexit is avoided, Sinn Fein will come under huge pressure to go back into the Assembly and restore the Executive. The question is, will they In the meantime, remember For the less you say, the less you hear andanyone asks who told you, then Please dont mention me!"},{"url":null,"title":"first minister told to come clean about use of party email account","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms. It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with All-Ireland winners. We are very proud to have two Loughinisland men who gave so much to the county, and continue to give so much to our club and community.Itrsquos a night not to be missed as this is a landmark year for the Down side who created history when they brought Sam Maguire across the border for the fth time.Louise said: ldquoIt may be one of the last times the squad will be together in a club in this capacity for a number of years and we are grateful they are spending that time with us. We will have a relaxed but enthralling evening as we look back at the glory days.While the spotlight will be on the Down legends, families from the Loughinisland Justice Group will be special guests at the event and their loved ones will be remembered during the night.Louise added: ldquoWe will also take time to remember that  was such a dficult year for Loughinisland. A quarter of a century on from the massacre, we will think back on the impact of the Down win on the community, the uplt that the team brought and the footballing spirit which helped people through the darkest days. We have a lot of stories to hear.The organisers have secured the Sam Maguire and Anglo-Celt cups for the event so there will be opportunities on the night to get photographs taken alongside the Down greats and the legendary silverware.Former Down and Loughinisland player Alan Molloy, who is also one of the organisers, said it was a remarkable feat that a small rural club like Loughinisland had three medals from the great teams of the s and their achievements had brought much joy and prestige to the club.He added: ldquoThis will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with these All-Ireland winners, including Loughinisland men Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, who gave so much to the county and continue to give so much to our club and community.ldquoGary Mason is the proud owner of two medals, from the victories in  and . Whilst Gerard Colgan was playing for An Riocht in , he spent the last of his playing days with Loughinisland. Both players are now passing on their valuable knowledge to the future generations through coaching our underage teams.ldquoThe club is very grateful that so many legends of the  team are ing to spend this evening with us.

There was a clearly much debate from the competitors about how muddy it was going to be andthey would have enough wet weather gear.As it turned out, the sun would appear and the rain would disappear leaving Lurgan Park looking beautully tranquil.The first race up was the U- race with Fiadh Kellett, Hugh and Conor Hetherington flying the flag for Dromara CC and more importantly loving the mud. Great to see them enjoying it.The U-s boysrsquo race saw young Oscar McBride loving the mud as he battled through the crown to claim eighth place in a competitive race.Aoe Kellett was in a tough U- girlsrsquo race that saw her put in a tremendous effort to claim third place with second place not far away. A great start to her league campaign and pressure on dad to produce in his race.James Armstrong has had a great summer of cycling and has taken this rich vein of form into the cyclo-cross. Curtis McKee, from Maryland Wheelers, would keep James from the top spot of the podium, but only by a mere six seconds.With junior members having set the scene at the cyclocross it was time for the senior team to get on their bikes.In the MTB Support race Mick Foley, fresh back from injury and claiming to be unfit, tore through the mud to claim a top  finish leaving expectations that he can only get better and better.The club had a large representation in the B race which saw  riders competing.It didnrsquot last long for Gibson Chambers as he got caught up in a crash at the start.This left Paul Hamilton taking the honour of first Dromara man home in sixth place, not far behind was Richard Cowan in eighth, Brian Kellett managed to take th and hold off Darren McCann, just.Adi Booth took the bragging rights as he finished ahead of Bryce Hetherington and Mike Barton finishing st, rd and th respectively.

We believe he is still finding out the additional things he can do with his new hand and therersquos still improvements ahead.Mr Moore said Alfie learnt to write with his left hand and still does but there is hope that over time, that he might be able to write and use his prosthesis hand for everything he normally does with his left hand.He says that Alfiersquos classmates and other pupils have accepted the new addition to the P pupil very well.Mr Moore added: ldquoWersquore never have had any problems with other children understanding about Alfie.

It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time. The Irish Street proposal has the potential to transform the town centre, providing additional business for existing traders, Cllr Curran added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 By.jpg","title":"By George he’s got it as Bright come good  ","story":"THE long wait is over. Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo. Honest, resolute, determined and committed.Ryan McEvoy, Dylan Ward and Aaron Morgan should be tasked with winning the ball in the middle of the park and supplying Paul Devlin, Conor Laverty and the Johnston brothers Ryan and Jerome mdash not forgetting younger brother Shealan when he is called upon.Kilcoo also have serious strength on the bench and in addition to Johnston the younger, they can call on Anthony Morgan, Paddy Devlin, Sean OHanlon, James McClean and Felim McGreevy,.Warrenpoint have made their way through some tricky ties unbeaten and along the way have accounted for An Riocht , Ballyholland , Longstoneand Ballyholland in the semi-final, - to -.Manager Niall McAleenan has the nucleus of the squad that won the IFC title in  and has also introduced some talented teenagers.He will rely on Adam Lynch, Pat Murdock, Ryan McAleenan, John Boyle, Eoghan Byrne and Ciaran McCartan to keep the Kilcoo attack quiet, bit few defences ever manage it.The Point cant afford to play in a defensive manner come Sunday. They must attack Kilcoo and utilise their magical set of forwards.McAleenans men have shipped a lot of scores in the league and to invite Kilcoo on to them would not be advisable.Thats why going at Kilcoo from the off and getting top scorer Ross McGarry involved early on is essential.McGarry is the one player who has the ability and temperament to unsettle Kilcoo.He is not the biggest full forward in the game, but he has pace, bravery and rarely misses in front of goal.He is undoubtedly Warrenpoints ace in the pack and along with the Boyle brothers adds a touch of class to the Points challenge.McGarry relies heavily on Donagh McAleenan, Ruairi McCormick, Aaron Magee, Ryan Mallon and Ryan Boyle and this unit must be firing on all cylindersWarrenpoint are to cause a shock win.Kilcoo are red hot favourites at   with a generous   being offered on Warrenpoint.

The key issue we have to address is the presence of a wet weather centre in the resort which I would suggest includes a fun-type family pool, he said.ldquoI believe that alongside this there needs to be a few swimming lanes to accommodate the needs of local people who have not had access to modern leisure facilities for some considerable time.Cllr Clarke said this issue needed to be flagged up as part of the consultation process on the way forward.He said it was important that elected representatives highlighted the needs of local people during the process.ldquoWe are talking about a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a modern leisure facility in Newcastle and we will not be settling for less. The location is good and while there may be issues with parking, these are not insurmountable.ldquoWe are talking about a complete new build which will maximise the large area of space at the rear of the existing centre and I would be keen to see a high quality design, comprising wood and glass, he said.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an eco-friendly building, which is both sustainable and carbon neutral..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Planners.jpg","title":"Planners recommend expansion at Newcastle’s Barbican supermarket  ","story":"A LEADING Newcastle business is in line for a major extension.Planners are recommending that mdash subject to a number of conditions mdash an amended proposal to expand the Barbican filling station at the Dundrum Road in the resort should be given the green light.The approval recommendation is due to be discussed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Wednesday of next week.The proposal includes the redevelopment of the existing petrol station and forecourt and extending the storersquos retail space.

","story":"BALLYNAHINCH shook off their insipid displays in the SONI Premiership to push much-fancied Terenure right to the wire in their first appearance back in AIL Division A since .The Dublin outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

It’s important to me.“I understand that there are people from the same bit of ground as I am who speak Ulster-Scots to whom that is equally important. I wanted to find out more.“My dad would have used Ulster-Scots expressions at home before I realised what they were. He’d say things like ‘red up’ and called us gaunches, or better, carnaptious gaunches. One of my favourite words in any language is the word ‘thran’.”For the programme Damian s to the Ards peninsula as he tries to understand why, for so many people, Ulster-Scots and its literary heritage is still important and relevant today. He reconnects with Hugh Robinson, who helped him start a writers’ group there, and spends time with native speakers and scholars including Carole Gilmore and Elaine McFeeters.Of the Irish language act which has seen red lines drawn at Stormont, and the limited use of Ulster-Scots in the Province, Damian said: “In our part of the world there are dficult conversations still to be had and that being the case I just think we need all the language we can get.”In his spare time Damian teaches conversational English to a group of Syrian refuges in Wales: “As has been pointed out to me I’ve passed on quite a bit of Ulster–Scots. There are people from Aleppo and Homs who are running round Aberystwyth using words like ‘red up’ and ‘carnaptious’.”Huge interest in new book on RHI scandal by Sam McBrideLatest update from criminal cases heard at Portsmouth Magistrates Court Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingF**k the Pope and the I.R.A. -

Prime Minister Boris Johnson meet in Cheshire last week. \"I think its pretty clear what were trying to do, but there are pretty detailed technical discussions now and I think we need to give the time and space for that to happen.\"Hopefully we can make progress today on those.\"He added: \"The message I would give is that we need to be cautious. This is not an easy job. Weve spent three years trying to get an agreement between the two sides and have made progress at dferent times.\"But certainly the last number of months have been dficult. So I think, as my Taoiseach has said, a deal is possible, and its possible this month, may even be possible this week. But were not there yet.D.U.P. leader, Arlene Foster and Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.\"And, as Michel Barnier said yesterday, theres still a lot of work to do, so I hope that we can make more progress today.\"Mr Coveney added: \"Our priority is to try to provide certainty to so many people who are awaiting a Brexit outcome and to do that as soon as possible.\"In a briefing to ambassadors of the remaining EU on Sunday in Brussels, Mr Barnier said that \"a lot of work remains to be done\".Appeal for calm over ‘loyalist action’ plan in event of Irish Sea border Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald spoke to the Prime Minister about the Stormont veto idea by telephone on Sunday, and told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"He assured me, or sought to assure me, that there would be no vetos afforded to anybody in this process. So I can only take him on his word on that matter.\"Mr Johnson has told senior ministers that, while a \"pathway\" to a deal could still be seen, there was \"still a signicant amount of work to get there\".In a Cabinet conference call, he said they still had to be prepared to leave on Halloween without a deal.And Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg has said the Government could achieve a no-deal Brexit by using European law.\"Theresa May got an extension not through UK law but through EU law and, until the  European Communities Act is repealed, EU law is superior law in the UK,\" he said on BBC Radio s Westminster Hour.\"And the Remainiacs all know that, because they know that it takes two to tango and any extension has to be agreed by the council.\"The sticking point remains the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop intended to guarantee there is noof a hard border with the Republic.Mr Barnier was reported to have raised concern about the complexity of a British plan to keep Northern Ireland in the UK customs territory while avoiding the need for border controls.There were reported to be doubts about the feasibility of the scheme which was said to involve tracking goods as they move through Northern Ireland and then determining the tarf to be paid depending where they end up.It raised the prospect that negotiations could carry on after this week, with the possibility of an emergency EU summit at the end of the month to finally approve any th hour agreement.However,Mr Johnson cannot get a deal by the weekend, he will come under intense pressure to seek a further Brexit delay, something he has vowed not to do.Labour has warned that,necessary, it will take action through the courts to force the PM to comply with the co-called Benn Act, which requires him to request an extension.Either way, the stage is set for a major Commons showdown when Mr Johnson s to Westminster for an emergency Saturday sitting of Parliament, the first in  years.If he cannot get a deal, he is widely expected to blame MPs for cutting the ground from under him, paving the way for a \"people versus Parliament\" general election.If he is able to get an agreement, Government sources have said they will seek to rush through legislation to raty it in time for the promised Halloween withdrawal date.try catch  TrendingF**k the Pope and the I.R.A. -

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The charityrsquos community services also support a further , terminally ill people and their families in their homes.Sarah Lloyd Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWersquore so grateful for every penny donated to us and we couldnrsquot provide expert care and support without people like Nick and Renzo.ldquoThe hospice is here for people living with any terminal illness, and their families.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall.

John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal.

And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in .

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.
