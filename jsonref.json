The best way to stop the leak would be to shut both main steam stops, which would halt the leak almost instantly.But that would come at a cost – a very big cost. If he did that, the nuclear reactor would be disabled and Revenge would be crippled, dead in the water.‘We would have to surface and signal for a tug,’ Thompson recalls in a book he has just published about his service in this most secretive branch of the Royal Navy.‘Unthinkable. Revenge was a Polaris missile submarine on Strategic Nuclear Deterrent patrol. She was the country’s duty guardian. Surfacing and calling for a tug would mean breaching one of the country’s most highly guarded secrets – where we were.’          NUCLEAR CRISIS: Senior engineer Eric Thompson aboard HMS RevengeHad that happened, the political ramifications would have been huge. With the then Labour Government facing noisy and insistent calls for unilateral disarmament, the image of a crippled nuclear-armed submarine being towed back from waters somewhere near the Soviet Union would have been humiliating and would have increased calls for an abandonment of Britain’s nuclear deterrent.The stakes for Thompson could not have been higher. He was damned one way and possibly killed the other. But then he had an idea, a way that could perhaps save both lives and national prestige. It would be a gamble, but he had nothing to lose.LAST month marked the 50th anniversary of the Royal Navy’s Submarine Service taking on the enormous burden of carrying Britain’s nuclear deterrent.On June 15, 1968, HMS Resolution slipped out of her dock at Faslane on the Clyde to start her first patrol. Resolution would be the first of four submarines in her class, and between them, from 1968 to 1996, they carried out an unbroken series of 229 Strategic Nuclear Deterrent patrols.For the entire duration, they were ready to fire their Polaris nuclear missiles at any target in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc at just 15 minutes’ notice. It was an extraordinary achievement, and it required extraordinary men and machines.Today, that duty is being carried out by the Navy’s four ageing Vanguard class submarines equipped with the Trident nuclear ballistic missile system, the fate of which is, of course, a political hot potato.Iain Ballantyne, author of The Deadly Trade: The Complete History Of Submarine Warfare From Archimedes To The Present, explains: ‘Paradoxically, the only way for Britain to have a voice in multilateral nuclear disarmament may be for it to build the new Dreadnought class submarines to give it the weight to demand an end to the nuclear balance of terror.‘What is deeply worrying is the current situation where Theresa May’s Government – and preceding Labour, Tory and Coalition administrations – have so weakened the nation’s conventional deterrent forces that nuclear weapons become the first resort – rather than the last resort – if the nation is faced with an existential threat from a nuclear-armed foe, such as Russia.’          Some crew members dressed in drag for the ship’s revues. Such theatrics provided an excuse for transvestism, and one snatched Polaroid shot shows a burly crew member in grotesque make-up, wearing lilac tights and a lurid green mesh top struggling to contain a false embonpoint the size of a couple of torpedoesIf there was some seriously bad news, it was withheld by the captain until the end of the patrol. Eric Thompson once had to inform a chief petty officer his wife had left him, and to another, he had to break the news that his father had died. But there was once worse. On the night before Repulse finished one of its patrols, Commander Bob Seaward had to summon one of his crew to inform him his wife and child had been killed in a car crash seven weeks before.‘After more than ten weeks on patrol, that poor man would have been overjoyed at the prospect of a reunion with his wife and child the following day,’ Thompson observes, ‘only to be told they had been killed.’Deal of the century: UK defence firm BAE wins contract worth...Ex-head of the Armed Forces lashes Theresa May for...Surveillance splurge: Government spends $7 BILLION on six...Bomb squad is called to BAE Systems after suspicious item is...Share this articleIn order to break the monotony of life on board, various entertainments were laid on. Of course, the Polaris subs operated well before Kindles and tablets, and today the entertainments seems almost quaint.Men played games such as Ludo and cribbage, or watched one of the 56 films brought on board. Quizzes were a staple activity and some aspiring disc jockeys even used the sub’s sound system to inflict their favourite music on crewmates. Fitness fanatics could use rowing and cycling machines, lift weights and even play table tennis. More cerebral types studied for public exams.Even plays and revues were staged. The exhibition in Gosport shows that on one patrol, a group called the Polaris Players staged a show called A Deep Distraction, featuring morris dancing, a barber shop quartet, and even a group describing themselves as ‘Scottish opera’.Such theatrics provided an excuse for transvestism, and one snatched Polaroid shot shows a burly crew member in grotesque make-up, wearing lilac tights and a lurid green mesh top struggling to contain a false embonpoint the size of a couple of torpedoes.Eric Thompson recalls one such ‘lady’ being so attractive that pin-ups of him appeared all over the submarine. ‘It’s frightening what eight weeks without female company can do to a man’s judgment,’ Thompson reflects.Such antics were not the only eccentricities that crew members displayed. One commanding officer was known to take a sports jacket and flannel trousers on every patrol and after the Sunday morning service, he would put them on and have a picnic in a private corner of the submarine.Banter and high jinks were also staple fare. Men could find themselves unable to get out of their bunks because they had been trapped inside by a wall of parcel tape. Cigars – yes, smoking was allowed – were sometimes fitted with exploding tips. Sleeping bags were placed into the rubbish compactor and returned to their owners as tight cubes.Naturally, with so many confined in such a small space for weeks, personalities could clash and tempers could flare, but with training and officers keeping discipline, there is no account of things getting out of control. In the main, it appears the men looked out for each other, with many performing selfless tasks.One of the most remarkable in the eyes of Eric Thompson was the supreme act of valour carried out by a crewmate called Tom Chittenden, who went scuba ing in the sewage tank to unlock the valve that released its contents overboard. With all the toilets blocked, had he not succeeded, the results would have been unthinkable. ‘He should have received an honour for that,’ Thompson writes.Had Chittenden become ill as a result of his e, he would have been treated by the submarine’s doctor, qualified to carry out many life-saving operations, as well as keeping his eye on the mental health of the crew.However, if a crewman was critically ill, he would have to survive until the end of the patrol. If he did not, his body would be stored in the food freezers. Nothing, not even life, was more important than maintaining the country’s nuclear deterrent.Of course, it was that which united these men – their exceptional role as the Prime Minister’s trigger if he or she wanted to launch a nuclear strike against, in all likelihood, the Soviet Union. The submarine had to be ready at all times to fire its missiles and to keep the crew sharp, weapons systems readiness tests were carried out at random.When the orders for such tests came in, the crew had no way of knowing whether the test was the real thing, and it was not until the senior officers had decoded the full order that the crew would become aware they were not in fact consigning millions of people to their deaths.It is chilling to reflect that each submarine had more firepower than all the ammunition expended in the Second World War. Of course, no such order has ever been issued for real. However, what was frighteningly real was the situation faced by Eric Thompson back in June 1978, with the critical leak of high-pressure steam.With just seconds to spare, Thompson decided to take a gamble on what he later called an ‘obscure dockyard procedure never used at sea’. Too complex to explain here, Thompson’s gamble involved the equivalent of ‘emptying the domestic hot water tank straight into the toilet’.‘For what seemed like an eternity, nothing happened,’ he recalled.‘The roaring of the steam continued. The humidity was unbearable. Then there was a mighty whoosh down the starboard steam range behind my back. \u0027It was like letting go the neck of an inflated balloon. The boiler had been deflated. The roar of steam had stopped.’Although crisis had been averted, for the next eight weeks, the maximum speed was severely reduced and there would be no extra power to deal with any emergencies. Thankfully, none came.What Thompson soon discovered was that one of the crew had tried to squeeze through the jungle of pipework through the scalding steam to shut down the critical valve, but had been unable to make it.In doing so, he ripped his back open. Thompson recommended him for a medal and the crewman, James ‘Bungy’ McWilliams, was awarded the Queen’s Gallantry Medal.Although there was no chance of a nuclear meltdown or the Polaris missiles detonating, it had been a close-run thing. It was the nearest – as far as we know – that our nuclear ballistic submarines have come to a major disaster.Meanwhile, the four Resolution class submarines are lying in a dock at Rosyth on the Firth of Forth, waiting to be decommissioned in a process costing many millions that will last until 2040.Once the secret killers of the deep, they can now be easily seen with Google Earth. It seems an ignominious ending for these awesome instruments of Armageddon.On Her Majesty’s Nuclear Service, by Eric Thompson, is published by Casemate Publishers, priced £19.99.

Mr Musk is thought to be behind the plans for the Graveney batteryUnlike most solar farms, Cleve Hill Solar Park’s panels will not all face south, but east and west in a continuous zig-zag.The effect, say the scheme’s opponents, will be to turn green meadows into something resembling a colossal factory roof.The proposed development would include the world’s biggest battery – almost three times as large as the current biggest, built last year by Tesla tycoon Elon Musk in South Australia.This has a capacity of 129 megawatt hours. The Graveney battery, also likely to be built by Mr Musk, will be capable of storing 350MWhr, with no fewer than 7,660 inidual battery units.California moves to require solar panels on all new homes by...Share this articleIn all, the battery units will cover an area the size of a further 15 football pitches.The battery is crucial to the scheme’s profitability.By storing power generated during sunny periods in the middle of the day when demand and the changing electricity ‘spot price’ are low, the operators will be able to sell it to the National Grid at other times – such as the evening – when no solar power is being generated and prices are much higher.The project is so large it will not be governed by the usual democratic planning process.Instead, it will fall to Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark to decide whether to approve it as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project.          The Graveney battery, also likely to be built by Elon Musk, will be capable of storing 350MWhrThe developers, a partnership between Hive Energy and Wirsol, part of a firm based in Germany, boast that with a maximum output of 350MW – seven times the size of any existing solar farm in Britain – it will ‘power over 110,00 homes’.However, they admit it will produce power only about 11 per cent of the time. The output of the nearby Medway gas-fired power station is 735MW, but this is continuous.Its site covers 15 acres – enough for just ten football pitches.When The Mail on Sunday visited Graveney last week, the only sounds at the site’s edge were the tweeting of skylarks and the rustle of grass in the wind.A huge and rare bird of prey, a marsh harrier, from one of the nesting pairs that now live on what may become the solar farm, flapped its wings in the distance, cruising the shoreline.The scheme has managed to unite environmentalists against it – from groups that would normally favour solar energy.Vicky Ellis, from the Kent branch of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We support renewable energy in the right place – such as on roofs, industrial and farm buildings.\u0027We don’t support trashing the countryside and losing productive farmland for the sake of chasing a profit.‘This is one of the most protected and fragile landscapes in Kent, of international importance, with some of the best and rarest bioersity in Europe, and it will be impossible to mitigate the loss of tranquillity and unique habitat.           The Cleve Hill sites 989,000 solar panels will be mounted on frames 12ft tall – the height of a double-decker bus          Campaigners are fighting to block a £400 million plan for a solar energy farm. Pictured the proposed site of the farm‘It is quite simply the industrialisation of rural Kent, depriving future generations of the chance to enjoy this wonderful and unique landscape.’Tim Valentine, speaking for the local Green Party, said: ‘We are very much in favour of renewable energy and the need to deploy it at scale.\u0027But it’s important we have the right schemes in the right places and we do not support a proposal that entails what amounts to a two-and-a-half-mile-long industrial roof over an area much loved by local people and surrounded by sites protected for wildlife.’Vinny Ganley, conservation adviser for the Kent Wildlife Trust, added: ‘This site has no precedent in its scale. \u0027We understand the need for solar power but we are very concerned about the impact it will have on wildlife.’A Hive Energy spokeswoman said the firm was working to minimise the scheme’s impact, claiming that sheep would graze among the panels.She added: ‘We are going beyond the legal requirements to engage with these organisations to have an ongoing dialogue to make this project agreeable.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/01/09/4DCC5FFC00000578-5905701-image-a-3_1530435055142.jpg","title":"Kim Pong North Korean leader watches production pink

The best way to stop the leak would be to shut both main steam stops, which would halt the leak almost instantly.But that would come at a cost – a very big cost. If he did that, the nuclear reactor would be disabled and Revenge would be crippled, dead in the water.‘We would have to surface and signal for a tug,’ Thompson recalls in a book he has just published about his service in this most secretive branch of the Royal Navy.‘Unthinkable. Revenge was a Polaris missile submarine on Strategic Nuclear Deterrent patrol. She was the country’s duty guardian. Surfacing and calling for a tug would mean breaching one of the country’s most highly guarded secrets – where we were.’          NUCLEAR CRISIS: Senior engineer Eric Thompson aboard HMS RevengeHad that happened, the political ramifications would have been huge. With the then Labour Government facing noisy and insistent calls for unilateral disarmament, the image of a crippled nuclear-armed submarine being towed back from waters somewhere near the Soviet Union would have been humiliating and would have increased calls for an abandonment of Britain’s nuclear deterrent.The stakes for Thompson could not have been higher. He was damned one way and possibly killed the other. But then he had an idea, a way that could perhaps save both lives and national prestige. It would be a gamble, but he had nothing to lose.LAST month marked the 50th anniversary of the Royal Navy’s Submarine Service taking on the enormous burden of carrying Britain’s nuclear deterrent.On June 15, 1968, HMS Resolution slipped out of her dock at Faslane on the Clyde to start her first patrol. Resolution would be the first of four submarines in her class, and between them, from 1968 to 1996, they carried out an unbroken series of 229 Strategic Nuclear Deterrent patrols.For the entire duration, they were ready to fire their Polaris nuclear missiles at any target in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc at just 15 minutes’ notice. It was an extraordinary achievement, and it required extraordinary men and machines.Today, that duty is being carried out by the Navy’s four ageing Vanguard class submarines equipped with the Trident nuclear ballistic missile system, the fate of which is, of course, a political hot potato.Iain Ballantyne, author of The Deadly Trade: The Complete History Of Submarine Warfare From Archimedes To The Present, explains: ‘Paradoxically, the only way for Britain to have a voice in multilateral nuclear disarmament may be for it to build the new Dreadnought class submarines to give it the weight to demand an end to the nuclear balance of terror.‘What is deeply worrying is the current situation where Theresa May’s Government – and preceding Labour, Tory and Coalition administrations – have so weakened the nation’s conventional deterrent forces that nuclear weapons become the first resort – rather than the last resort – if the nation is faced with an existential threat from a nuclear-armed foe, such as Russia.’          Some crew members dressed in drag for the ship’s revues. Such theatrics provided an excuse for transvestism, and one snatched Polaroid shot shows a burly crew member in grotesque make-up, wearing lilac tights and a lurid green mesh top struggling to contain a false embonpoint the size of a couple of torpedoesIf there was some seriously bad news, it was withheld by the captain until the end of the patrol. Eric Thompson once had to inform a chief petty officer his wife had left him, and to another, he had to break the news that his father had died. But there was once worse. On the night before Repulse finished one of its patrols, Commander Bob Seaward had to summon one of his crew to inform him his wife and child had been killed in a car crash seven weeks before.‘After more than ten weeks on patrol, that poor man would have been overjoyed at the prospect of a reunion with his wife and child the following day,’ Thompson observes, ‘only to be told they had been killed.’Deal of the century: UK defence firm BAE wins contract worth...Ex-head of the Armed Forces lashes Theresa May for...Surveillance splurge: Government spends $7 BILLION on six...Bomb squad is called to BAE Systems after suspicious item is...Share this articleIn order to break the monotony of life on board, various entertainments were laid on. Of course, the Polaris subs operated well before Kindles and tablets, and today the entertainments seems almost quaint.Men played games such as Ludo and cribbage, or watched one of the 56 films brought on board. Quizzes were a staple activity and some aspiring disc jockeys even used the sub’s sound system to inflict their favourite music on crewmates. Fitness fanatics could use rowing and cycling machines, lift weights and even play table tennis. More cerebral types studied for public exams.Even plays and revues were staged. The exhibition in Gosport shows that on one patrol, a group called the Polaris Players staged a show called A Deep Distraction, featuring morris dancing, a barber shop quartet, and even a group describing themselves as ‘Scottish opera’.Such theatrics provided an excuse for transvestism, and one snatched Polaroid shot shows a burly crew member in grotesque make-up, wearing lilac tights and a lurid green mesh top struggling to contain a false embonpoint the size of a couple of torpedoes.Eric Thompson recalls one such ‘lady’ being so attractive that pin-ups of him appeared all over the submarine. ‘It’s frightening what eight weeks without female company can do to a man’s judgment,’ Thompson reflects.Such antics were not the only eccentricities that crew members displayed. One commanding officer was known to take a sports jacket and flannel trousers on every patrol and after the Sunday morning service, he would put them on and have a picnic in a private corner of the submarine.Banter and high jinks were also staple fare. Men could find themselves unable to get out of their bunks because they had been trapped inside by a wall of parcel tape. Cigars – yes, smoking was allowed – were sometimes fitted with exploding tips. Sleeping bags were placed into the rubbish compactor and returned to their owners as tight cubes.Naturally, with so many confined in such a small space for weeks, personalities could clash and tempers could flare, but with training and officers keeping discipline, there is no account of things getting out of control. In the main, it appears the men looked out for each other, with many performing selfless tasks.One of the most remarkable in the eyes of Eric Thompson was the supreme act of valour carried out by a crewmate called Tom Chittenden, who went scuba ing in the sewage tank to unlock the valve that released its contents overboard. With all the toilets blocked, had he not succeeded, the results would have been unthinkable. ‘He should have received an honour for that,’ Thompson writes.Had Chittenden become ill as a result of his e, he would have been treated by the submarine’s doctor, qualified to carry out many life-saving operations, as well as keeping his eye on the mental health of the crew.However, if a crewman was critically ill, he would have to survive until the end of the patrol. If he did not, his body would be stored in the food freezers. Nothing, not even life, was more important than maintaining the country’s nuclear deterrent.Of course, it was that which united these men – their exceptional role as the Prime Minister’s trigger if he or she wanted to launch a nuclear strike against, in all likelihood, the Soviet Union. The submarine had to be ready at all times to fire its missiles and to keep the crew sharp, weapons systems readiness tests were carried out at random.When the orders for such tests came in, the crew had no way of knowing whether the test was the real thing, and it was not until the senior officers had decoded the full order that the crew would become aware they were not in fact consigning millions of people to their deaths.It is chilling to reflect that each submarine had more firepower than all the ammunition expended in the Second World War. Of course, no such order has ever been issued for real. However, what was frighteningly real was the situation faced by Eric Thompson back in June 1978, with the critical leak of high-pressure steam.With just seconds to spare, Thompson decided to take a gamble on what he later called an ‘obscure dockyard procedure never used at sea’. Too complex to explain here, Thompson’s gamble involved the equivalent of ‘emptying the domestic hot water tank straight into the toilet’.‘For what seemed like an eternity, nothing happened,’ he recalled.‘The roaring of the steam continued. The humidity was unbearable. Then there was a mighty whoosh down the starboard steam range behind my back. \u0027It was like letting go the neck of an inflated balloon. The boiler had been deflated. The roar of steam had stopped.’Although crisis had been averted, for the next eight weeks, the maximum speed was severely reduced and there would be no extra power to deal with any emergencies. Thankfully, none came.What Thompson soon discovered was that one of the crew had tried to squeeze through the jungle of pipework through the scalding steam to shut down the critical valve, but had been unable to make it.In doing so, he ripped his back open. Thompson recommended him for a medal and the crewman, James ‘Bungy’ McWilliams, was awarded the Queen’s Gallantry Medal.Although there was no chance of a nuclear meltdown or the Polaris missiles detonating, it had been a close-run thing. It was the nearest – as far as we know – that our nuclear ballistic submarines have come to a major disaster.Meanwhile, the four Resolution class submarines are lying in a dock at Rosyth on the Firth of Forth, waiting to be decommissioned in a process costing many millions that will last until 2040.Once the secret killers of the deep, they can now be easily seen with Google Earth. It seems an ignominious ending for these awesome instruments of Armageddon.On Her Majesty’s Nuclear Service, by Eric Thompson, is published by Casemate Publishers, priced £19.99.

The best of them, like all the brightest days of summer, seem both real and imagined.As a later strand of the same series, Laval began taking photographs of abandoned or disused private pools in the US, pictures that seemed all about loss or mortality. You could perhaps convince yourself that you could feel that coda coming as you look at this picture. As David Hockney emphasised with his Californian pool scenes, there is always a dramatic narrative poolside, the before and after of taking the plunge.

And that poem helped me get through it.”Hours after writing Mama, Mahmoud – also known as Emi, who was born in Darfur but moved to the US from Yemen as a four-year-old – performed it at the 2015 Inidual World Poetry Slam Championship in Washington DC – and won the competition. Full of fury, Mama opens as a man asks Mahmoud: “Hey yo sistah, you from the motherland? … ’cause you got a little bit of flavor in you,  I’m just admiring what your mama gave you.” It becomes a paean to Mahmoud’s mother, who “can reduce a man to tattered flesh without so much as blinking”, who “walks into a war zone and has warriors cowering at her feet”.“Don’t talk about the motherland unless you know  that being from Africa means waking up an  afterthought in this country.  Don’t talk about my flavor unless you know  that my flavor is insurrection, it is rebellion,  resistance,” Mahmoud recited, bringing the audience to their feet and receiving a perfect score.In London on a flying visit to the UK – she’s been in Birmingham speaking on Philanthropy Age’s How to Do Good tour – Mahmoud is overflowing with charisma. She has so much to talk about, from working in refugee camps in Greece (she pulls out a wallet made from a life jacket a boy on Lesbos gave her) to meetings with the Dalai Lama (“He said: ‘There’s a lot of pain in Darfur and in Sudan’ and I was like, ‘There is’. He held my hand for a bit and I said, ‘I’m working on it and we’re with you.’”)But she’s getting ahead of herself. She turned 22 shortly after winning the slam, at which point her life started to become a little surreal. Still a student at Yale, where she was studying molecular, cellular and developmental biology and anthropology, Mahmoud was chosen as one of the BBC’s 100 most inspirational women in 2015, and wrote the poem The Things She Told Me to mark the honour. In the middle of her exams, she was invited by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences to speak at a nuclear ethics conference. “It was terrifying,” she says. “I thought, ‘They’re going to use me. I’m going to be a token.’” One of her professors told her: “Everyone is going to come with their own agenda but you stay true to what it is you want to get out there.”Mahmoud went she listened she spoke for an hour, interspersing her poetry into her talk, putting a human face on the refugee crisis and on the atrocities of Darfur. She’s since taken part in round-table discussions at the White House, including with Barack Obama, she’s opened for Ban Ki-Moon at UN events, and spoke in New Delhi to launch the 100 Million child advocacy campaign alongside Nobel peace prize winner Kailash Satyarthi. She’s nearly always the youngest person in a room.She’s recently published her debut poetry collection, Sister’s Entrance. It moves from the personal – love poems, the experience of growing up a black Muslim in the US – to the political. Head Over Heels stems from a question she was asked at her first UN general assembly meeting: “The one-millionth refugee just left South Sudan can you comment?”“Our once country—  all west, and south, and east, and north—  so restless, the Nile couldn’t hold us together  and you ask me to summarise?” she writes. Her performance is blistering. “I wrote it afterwards, I was furious.”Her poetry, she says, expresses the real emotions behind the headlines. “It’s hard, in our world, when you see violence everywhere – you’re desensitised to it,” she says. “What I try to do is to change the approach, so it helps people feel like it’s OK to feel again and to recognise that it is scary and it does hurt, and , it’s OK to cry. And people do cry.”Since she’s graduated, she’s returned frequently to Sudan, setting up “poetry town halls” for locals to share thoughts in a safe space. Earlier this year, she walked from Darfur to Khartoum in 30 days to raise awareness for peace, in what she dubbed the One Girl Walk. Thousands joined her en route sometimes, they marched through tanks. She was scared. She performed her poetry.“My parents got death threats every single day when I was walking. We were ... constantly under surveillance,” she says. “Their narrative was: ‘The Sudanese government has been conducting a weapons recollection programme and putting more security out there into the country, and security equals peace. Because there is security, there is peace, and this girl is walking because she wants to prove Sudan is safe.’ My narrative was: ‘If we can walk together we can work together, we can create and inspire a collective responsibility for peace. We’ll bring the peace together.’”Mahmoud will return to Sudan in July, where she has big plans for more community groups and workshops around the country. Mostly she is volunteering, saving the money she makes from events “run by magazines or businesses that pay very well … to do the kind of work you can’t get funding for.”Mahmoud writes to explore her feelings she performs, she says, because she has somehow found herself this platform. “A lot of things are said about people like me - young people, black people, Muslim people, women,” she says. “The reason I perform is to answer those things, to be a voice I didn’t really have growing up.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2967beb41dafaa2c33d03b54ceddfaa59c8a2b74/0_280_4199_2519/master/4199.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d3ae7b59dc1ddfb5b1353a699e7903","title":"were righting a wrong say the artists taking on youtube","story":"This week sees the final episode in the battle for the musicians fighting for a fairer dealThe music industry and YouTube are set to go head-to-head this week in a crucial vote in Brussels that could force the digital giant to pay billions of dollars in fees to popular artists such as Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Katy Perry. For years the music industry has argued that YouTube exploits the lack of legal protection around music videos being viewed on its service to pay minimal amounts to artists and labels. Artists and labelswon a key Brussels vote last month on the adoption of new copyright laws – putting them on the verge of forcing a dramatic shift in the balance of power away from the Silicon Valley giant – but on Thursday the European parliament will decide the victor.YouTube got a bloody nose in last month’s vote but its supporters are expected to gather the 76 MEPs needed to challenge that decision and force a vote by all 751 members of the parliament.“I think if you could pop a ‘provisional’ bottle of champagne then yes, that is what I’m doing,” said Martin Mills, founder of Beggars Group, which has represented artists including Adele, Radiohead and the xx. Warner Music’s chief, Steve Cooper, said its deal with YouTube last year was not a “free market” negotiation, and that the new European copyright law would force YouTube to the table.“The record industry has thoroughly negotiated deals with Spotify and Apple and so on but the problem with YouTube is that kind of discussion has not been possible,” says Mills. “For me, it is less about how much more the superstars will make than the power it will give working musicians, day-to-day artists, to strike deals to enable them to survive and be the artisan they want to be.”Taylor Swift has led the fight for artists to get a better share of revenues in the age of the digital music giants.In 2014, she pulled her music from Spotify, saying artists receive a tiny royalty per song playand has been the catalyst for the much better deals struck by record labels with Spotify in the past 18 months.The outlier has remained YouTube which has well over 1 billion users who regularly watch music videos. Its immense scale makes it not just financially important but critical in hit-making in the same way MTV was in the 1980s and 90s.“Despacito would probably not have become the global phenomenon it did without YouTube,” says Mark Mulligan, analyst at MIDiA Research. Last year, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s reggaeton hit took the world by storm becoming the most streamed song of all time. “YouTube is the number one place where young people discover music. If you are going to create global hits you need YouTube and it is becoming more important to musicians.”YouTube makes money from advertising and last year paid $856m (£650m) in royalties to music companies – an estimated 67 cents from each of its 1.3 billion music lovers annually. In the UK, record labels and artists earn more than double the royalties from the sale of 4.1m vinyl records than they did from the 25bn music videos watched on YouTube last year.Musician Billy Bragg says the battle against YouTube is less about the potential financial windfall that artists might get, and more about making sure the new digital music power players play fair.“We’ve all seen how, with the recent data protection legislation, the European Union has shifted power to the inidual online,” he says. “Now they’re seeking to do the same for artists. All we’re asking for is a level playing field … rebalancing the power between artists and the internet tech giants who are making massive profits while paying tiny royalties.”YouTube has made moves to mollify the industry launching a premium subscription service – two days before the crucial European vote – a move Jean-Michel Jarre, electro-pioneer and president of music body Cisac, has cynically called “indirect lobbying” to try to improve its image."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/454fd648524d97a12aa73d302cd96d410cf437bc/1_0_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=503ac523343049412712cbedcf6736be","title":"quiz how well do you know business jargon","story":"Want to get soaked in a thought shower?

Matthew Oates, a National Trust volunteer and one of the UK’s leading butterfly experts, said: “The butterfly seems to be having a very good year, with over 200 seen during the count. “Ideal weather conditions a cold and harsh winter, which has helped knock back the bracken and then a warm and sunny May and June have been ideal for caterpillar development.“As we are having some fairly dry weather, it’s now the perfect time for seeing this large and powerful butterfly.” Conservationists believe changes to woodland management, such as the abandonment of coppicing, have contributed to the steep decline of the large, fast-flying butterfly over the past 50 years.The National Trust has been given £100,000 by the People’s Postcode Lottery to improve 60 hectares (150 acres) of lowland heath and wood pasture at Heddon Valley in north Devon as a habitat for the butterfly. Other butterflies including the heath fritillary, as well as birds such as the nightjar and Dartford warbler, are also expected to benefit. To make Heddon Valley more butterfly friendly, pathways have been cut through the bracken using a remote-controlled flailing machine to allow them to move through the landscape. The high brown fritillary (argynnis adippe) is usually seen flying over bracken and low vegetation in woodland clearings or resting on flowers such as thistle and bramble. The butterfly has orange and black wings and distinctive ringed “pearls” on the underside of its hindwings.It was once widespread in England and Wales but since the 1950s has suffered a dramatic decline and is only found at about 50 sites. In addition to Exmoor, other sites include Dartmoor in Devon and outcrops of limestone at Morecambe Bay.High brown fritillaries overwinter as eggs, which are laid singly on leaf litter on dog violets or among moss growing on limestone outcrops.The larvae hatch in early spring and spend long periods basking on dead bracken or in short, sparse vegetation.The temperatures in these microhabitats can be 15-20C higher than in surrounding grassy vegetation, allowing the larvae to develop quickly even in cool spring weather. The larvae have feathered brown spines, giving them the appearance of dead bracken fronds.A charity warned last week that Britain’s biggest butterfly, the swallowtail, could become extinct within four decades because of rising sea levels. The Swallowtail and Birdwing Butterfly Trust called for new inland habitat to be created for the swallowtail because much of its home, the Norfolk Broads, are predicted to turn into salt marshes later this century."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39057f11b3b2d16ad67064f5d35feb9a77f1a0fc/0_334_5016_3010/master/5016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0d614541acafb66b198f31af4c6d43f","title":"clare waight keller show paris celebrates hubert de givenchy legacy","story":"A collection focusing on the pas de deux between the designer and his muse Audrey HepburnClare Waight Keller’s autumn 2018 couture show, which took place in Paris on a hot Sunday night, capped off quite the summer for the British-born artistic director of Givenchy. Or, as she is perhaps more widely known, the woman who designed the Duchess of Sussex’s wedding dress.This was only her second couture show, though in her 16-month tenure at the French fashion house she has already proven to be a lot of firsts: the first of Givenchy’s artistic directors to dare to bring couture back after the house dismantled it in 2012. And the first woman appointed to head the storied house that Hubert de Givenchy built. But, as she said backstage, she was also the first artistic director to meet the founder and designer who died three months ago: “and so having met him and spoken to him and the fact that he passed only three months ago, I realised his legacy needed to be celebrated”.And so, in what also became a day of posthumous celebrations at Paris’s couture – first at Sonia Rykiel whose collection was a stylistic homage to the work of Rykiel who died in 2016, and then here – Waight Keller also became the first person at Givenchy to address his legacy in full. Both by rifling through his archive, and in a collection which concentrated on the pas de deux between the designer and his muse, Audrey Hepburn, and a relationship upon which the entire Hollywood fashion industry was arguably built. How? Most obviously via an unambiguous finale which finished with both a Holly Golightly-esque sleeveless black dress and Hepburn’s rendition of Moon River playing overhead.Set in the grand gardens behind the Archives Nationales, and based around a bronze metallic catwalk which reflected both the chestnut trees and partially clouded sky, the show was otherwise an unabashed celebration of 50s and 60s glamour. This was key, she said: “we all know the big stars of couture but Hubert was the other star of the 50s and 60s that came out”. Givenchy has a history of connecting women to shape, and the collection focused on the singular aesthetic of Hollywood glamour, realised in complementary ways. Either via sharp, clean tailoring or through grand, floor-sweeping gowns. Both were predominantly monochrome with the odd flash of emerald green, icy pastels or dark mineral palette. There wasn’t a whiff of duchess Meghan’s ultra-simple dress – and no questions asked – although most of the drama did centre around the shoulders, in true Givenchy style. Sturdy capelets dominated the first half, in full-length silken jackets or more cropped and structured shapes or robing model’s shoulders leaving them hands free. Or shoulders rose up from tulip-shaped dresses which virtually sat on the elbow, or from coat-like dresses which were full-length and came with another GivenchyHepburn tic – the bow. Waight Keller was keen to look to the past, and to the symbiosis between Givenchy and Hepburn, but recast it in her vernacular “so as not to let her overwhelm it” she said. “I didn’t re-watch anything, I just wanted to absorb what I knew”. She trawled through his archives and came across “capes, the peekaboo necklines, and the architecture. There were things I didn’t know he did.” Most eyebrow raising was the use of metal, which was beaten into shape to form chokers, and crescent-shaped hair pieces, and which was a central if underdocumented part of the Givenchy archive. Perhaps the greatest reminder of past and present came when a drone flying overhead to film the show narrowly missed a gull.If the collection felt almost architectural, Waight Keller was the first to admit it: “it is very difficult to get the shape and line with feathers.” The challenge, she said, was to create “a floorless feeling – to create something that floats” but using modern materials not available to Hubert, she said, alluding to rich silks, French velvet, soft leathers, Japanese bonding techniques and sequins designed to move like liquid. “It made everything feel much more modern.” Even the Hepburn-esque black dress came updated, with a crossed back and monastic black hood.With sales split 50-50 between men’s and women’s, she also included menswear in her show, although the structured variations on black tie were far from distracting. That one male model carried a dog chain suggests the Givenchy couture man is more of a plus one. Still there is a lot riding on Waight Keller’s work. The brand has revenues near enough to €600m (£530m). When she joined, Bernard Arnault believed she would increase revenue further still – the aim, it’s said, is to reach the Dior “billion dollar club” as the press sometimes calls it. Prior to her role at Givenchy, the designer had worked her way up fashion’s hierarchy, working on menswear at Ralph Lauren, and then at Gucci, Pringle of Scotland and most recently, Chloe. Predictions that she would bring the soft-focus breeziness of Chloe – where she was creative director for six years – to Givenchy and perhaps bring back the brand’s “Hepburn history” have been heard in the wings reductively or not, both women are routinely described as gamine. The show notes mentioned Hubert de Givenchy’s “mythical oeuvre”, and the relationship between “noble fabrics” and “an untouched natural beauty”. In short, the past of Givenchy reimagined for the present for the first time in the label’s history.

Yet Beanie Feldstein is exactly that and about to start shooting the lead in the film adaptation of Moran’s 2014 novel How to Build a Girl – the semi-autobiographical story of working-class Wolverhampton teenager Johanna Morrigan, who moves to London in the 90s to reinvent herself as a music journalist and “full-time lady sex adventurer”.It will be 25-year-old Feldstein’s first lead role. She made her acting debut aged nine in the ABC sitcom My Wife and Kids and went to theatre camp and appeared in school productions during her teens. Her first significant film role was in the debauched college comedy Bad Neighbors 2 alongside Seth Rogen and Zac Efron and she made her Broadway debut in last year’s sellout revival of Hello, Dolly!, starring Bette Midler. But it was her performance last year in writer-director Greta Gerwig’s coming-of-age comedy-drama Lady Bird that confirmed Feldstein’s arrival. Playing Julie Steffans, the best friend of Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan), she ran away with most of the scenes she was in. The film was nominated for five Oscars.“As soon as we saw her in Lady Bird, we knew we’d both found Johanna and seen someone who was going to be a superstar,” says Caitlin Moran. “From the moment you see her, you root for her.Feldstein’s real first name is Elizabeth and the nickname Beanie came from a British nanny who called her “Elizabean”. “Sometimes I introduce myself to people and their reaction reminds me that it’s insane that my name is Beanie,” she says down the phone from Los Angeles. She’s from a tight-knit, semi-showbizzy family: her father’s a music-business accountant, her mother is a costume designer and her brother is the actor Jonah Hill. Eldest brother, Jordan, a music manager, died suddenly from a heart attack six months ago, aged 40. I’m told this is the only subject that’s off limits during our interview.If Feldstein’s grief is still raw, you wouldn’t know it because she’s effervescent company. She’s into nail art (“It’s the thing I spend the most money on”), Harry Potter (“At my core, I’m Mrs Weasley but that’s partly because I’m a huge Julie Walters fan”), Gilmore Girls and Queer Eye. Were you already a fan of her work?I wasn’t very familiar before going up for the role. I’ve since devoured every single piece of writing and every YouTube video. Once I started, I couldn’t stop. Now you’re heading to Wolverhampton to learn the accent …I am! I’m going for two weeks before we start shooting to just immerse myself in it. I’ve been to London twice but never the Midlands. I came with my mom on a sightseeing trip when I was younger, then again for a few days when I auditioned. I can’t wait to spend more time in the UK.So let’s talk Lady Bird. Has it been a nine-month whirlwind of award shows and acclaim?It’s been so special – not only because so many people have seen the film but how they hold it close. You get the sense it’s truly beloved. The movie was a turning point for me, too. I’ll remember my life as pre-Lady Bird and post-Lady Bird.Julie’s become something of a cult character. What’s her appeal?I think people relate to the fact that she’s unwavering in her love for Lady Bird – but equally unwavering in her self-worth. Julie doesn’t feel the need to change herself because Lady Bird’s pulling away from her she stays true to who she is.In some respects, is the film a love story between Lady Bird and\u0026nbspJulie?Absolutely. Greta always says that’s the big romance of the film. In most coming-of-age movies, it’s a guy arriving at the girl’s house to take her to the prom. In our film, that scene is between two girls. A teenage girl shows up for her friend, saying, “I was wrong, please have me back and let me be your date.” As the major romantic gesture of the story, that’s so meaningful.Is it true you kept notes on your phone called “Things Greta said today”?Well, I wanted to remember the experience as best I could – but it was an old-school notebook. We didn’t have phones on set, which was incredible – and certainly something I’ll copy if I ever direct. It forced everybody to look up, talk to each other, not get distracted. That was so vital for me and Saoirse forming our relationship because we just sat, talked, quoted Kristen Wiig sketches and goofed around between scenes.You’ve called Laurie Metcalf, who played Lady Bird’s mother, “the most inspiring woman in existence”. Why?I grew up only ever wanting to do theatre, that was my first love, and Laurie is an institution in the theatre world. She’s devoted to stage work but she navigates between that, film and TV. That’s a path I’d love to follow.Metcalf is best known in the UK as Roseanne’s sister Jackie. What did you think of the sitcom’s revival being cancelled after Roseanne Barr’s racist “joke”?That tweet was horrible. She did not deserve to be the lead of the show after that because it was the most disgusting thing.Lady Bird and How to Build a Girl are both female-led films – as is your next release, Olivia Wilde’s directorial debut Booksmart. Is that a conscious choice in the #MeToo era?There’s such a push now for everyone to be represented, regardless of gender, sexuality or race. It’s immensely important to tell their stories. I’m a huge feminist, I majored in sociology at college and I care about what I put into the world. I feel very lucky in my short working life to have been part of projects I’m proud of. Greta has set the bar high and now everything has to live up to Lady Bird. That movie opened my eyes to what film can do and how powerful it can be for people.Lady Bird is set at a Catholic high school in Sacramento. How did it compare with your own school days?I was very much in the theatre crowd, so the fact that I was doing a high-school movie where my character was in a Sondheim musical was like living my dream. Personality-wise, I lie somewhere between Lady Bird and Julie. I have Julie’s affectionate nature and intense loyalty but Lady Bird’s fire as well.Wasn’t your own prom date Ben Platt, star of the Pitch Perfect films and Broadway?It was. Ben is my soulmate, the twin I don’t have. We met at a bar mitzvah, we’ve been best friends for over a decade, and even now, we still sometimes say the exact same thing at the exact same time, then just start laughing. Maybe we were separated at birth.Jonah Hill is your older brother. Are you competitive?The only thing we compete about is impersonating our mom. We’re always arguing over whose impression is best. Other than that, we’re so supportive of one another. There’s also a pretty big age gap, nearly 10 years between us, so we were always at different stages of life.Might you work together one day?I’d love to. Jonah’s becoming such an incredible writer and director, so I could be in something he created, or we could act together. We’d both be up for that if it was the right project.Vogue called you “the next Bette Midler” after you appeared alongside her on Broadway. How was that?An honour. Bette’s the hardest working person I’ve ever encountered. She never takes breaks, never sits down, she’s a force of nature. To be around that and soak it up was a precious gift.Aren’t you an Abba fan?Big Abba fan. Huuuuge. I wake up every morning to Take a Chance on Me as my iPhone alarm – it really gets you going. I’m excited about them reforming and excited for Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. This is a very thrilling Abba year for me.Lady Bird is available to stream now and on DVDBlu-ray from tomorrow"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5f3e1f0983326cf457803c974c8e184efc1c6ad/0_4_2111_1267/master/2111.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b498605008ce5b735a537b94b4d6e1f0","title":"croatia denmark world cup last 16 match report","story":"There are some matches in which the spectre of penalties begins to loom with indecent haste. Everybody knew where this last-16 showdown was heading from an early point in the second half – possibly even sooner – and yet it might have needed only a single penalty.The second period of extra time was rumbling to its seemingly inevitable conclusion when Luka Modric finally picked a pass and, all of a sudden, Ante Rebic was clean through. The Croatia winger rounded Kasper Schmeichel but he was brought down by the chasing Mathias Jørgensen, who was booked.It was the most obvious penalty of the World Cup and the responsibility fell to Modric. It would be too much. His kick was too close to Schmeichel, who saved and, at that point, everybody in Croatia was thinking about Euro 2008, when they had lost on penalties to Turkey in the quarter-final. Back then Modric missed one of the kicks. There would be a reprieve for him and his country on this occasion.The shootout was low on quality and heavy on nerves, which was a neat precis of what had gone before. Christian Eriksen set the tone for Denmark when he saw his kick tipped on to a post by Danijel Subasic and the Croatia goalkeeper would also deny Lasse Schöne and Nicolai Jørgensen. Schmeichel saved from Milan Badelj and Josip Pivaric but it was Ivan Rakitic who had the kick to win it.Rakitic made no mistake and it will be Croatia that take on Russia in the quarter-final on Saturday. Modric had scored with his shootout kick, although only just. It was another wobbly one, low and straight up the middle and Schmeichel got his boot to it but could not keep it out.The Croatia players threw Subasic up in the air during the celebrations and – in keeping with the tone of the evening – they dropped him. Mercifully Zlatko Dalic, the manager, reported he was not injured. “He was our hero tonight,” Dalic said.The strange thing was that the tie had exploded into life at the outset to set up the possibility of a classic, with the goals coming with the first two moves. They were defined by comical defending but there was little to smile about for the remaining 116 minutes. What followed was the slow death of a spectacle. It was tight and subdued, the entertainment value horribly low.Croatia had been arguably the team of the group stage, sweeping past Nigeria, Argentina and Iceland to advance into what was their first knockout tie since 1998, when they went all the way to the semi-finals. But it felt as though Dalic’s vibrant team were unnerved by what was at stake. It was a weirdly passive performance from them, in which they created precious little after Mario Mandzukic had cancelled out Mathias Jørgensen’s goal.Denmark were not exactly Danish dynamite, which has been the story of their tournament. Ăge Hareide had promised that people would see “a different Denmark” but this was more of the same – a rigid display loaded with defensive discipline, in which they managed to nullify the threat of Modric and Rakitic.“It was a wonderful effort but this is the brutality of football,” Hareide said. “We had a fantastic goalkeeper in Kasper but it didn’t help. Research has proved during penalty shootouts that your adrenaline and stress levels are as high as when you are in a war zone.”Schmeichel added: “If you have the balls to take a penalty, you have my respect. Anyone brave enough to take one is a hero. We win and lose as a team.”The opening exchanges had offered no clues as to what would come. Jonas Knudsen’s long throws were a weapon for Denmark and, from his first one, the ball broke to Thomas Delaney, who worked it to Mathias Jørgensen and he jabbed in a low shot. Subasic was slow to get down and, although he got a hand to the ball, he could not prevent it from trickling inside the near post. It was a horribly soft concession.Croatia’s response was immediate and this time it was the Danes who could curse their defending. Rebic released Sime Vrsaljko and his low cross did not look threatening. But Henrik Dalsgaard’s clearance was panicked, it hit the covering Andreas Christensen in the face and ricocheted to Mario Mandzukic, who swivelled and shot home. What a mess. What a start.The remainder of the game felt like a reaction to the initial chaos. Neither team had previously conceded in open play at the tournament they were not disposed to such openness and they sought to re-impose order. Caution held sway and it became an awfully tough watch.Schmeichel made a double save in the first half to deny Rakitic and Rebic before Ivan Perisic fired the rebound high while Dejan Lovren glanced wide from a Modric free-kick. That was about it for Croatia until the Modric penalty. Where was the cut and thrust that had characterised their progress?Denmark’s creative burden rested with Eriksen – almost everything in open play went through him – and there were couple of flickers from him in the first-half, including the moment when he floated a cross towards the back post and watched it kiss the angle of the upright. But his penalty miss summed up an evening of frustration. Croatia live to fight on.

The paper planes that landed on the pitch felt like a symbol of the fans’ apathy. Jeers soon followed. “Bored spectators, paper planes and early exits – something is seriously wrong with this England team,” was one headline. And it was even worse, as Southgate could also remember, during England’s excursion to Malta the previous month when the opponents featured a centre-half from Ebbsfleet United and, for many of the travelling supporters, something snapped.The mass walkout around the 70-minute mark that night seemed like a choreographed protest. The chants of “We’re fucking shit” told their own story and what has never been reported until now is that England’s players were also targeted as they left the ground. Malta were 190th out of 211 teams in Fifa’s rankings and had won only five competitive matches in 55 years. Yet it was 0-0 at half-time and a late goal rush, when England scored three times, did not spare Southgate and his players on the journey away from the stadium. The chants informed them they were not fit to wear the shirt. It was spiteful, mutinous and the culmination, undoubtedly, of too many years of pent-up frustration.Ten months on the current side will be in Moscow on Tuesday to take on Colombia for a place in the quarter-finals of the World Cup and Southgate – the man who applied for several Championship jobs without even getting an interview only a few years ago – has held himself in such a way he is doubling up, apparently, as an unexpected leader of fashion, asked in one BBC interview whether he was aware how much waistcoat sales had rocketed back in England.“They’ve been able to change perceptions of how an England team might play,” Southgate said of his players. “We mustn’t lose sight of that. When we qualified, people were throwing paper aeroplanes on to the pitch at Wembley. We were driving back to our hotel in Malta with obscene chants being thrown at us from supporters.“I feel like we’ve started to connect the team with the public again. I feel like we’ve created excitement, that we’ve played in a style that has really shown what young English players are capable of, and I want us to continue doing that. I really believe in the group of players we’ve got. They are young. They are inexperienced. For some of them, this will be one of the biggest games they’ll have been involved in. But maybe not the biggest. We’ve always got to keep that context for the players.”His belief is that England cannot “consider ourselves a top team until we have beaten a top team” but he is encouraging them to think like one before they get the chance to stake that claim against players such as Radamel Falcao, Juan Cuadrado and, injury permitting, James Rodríguez. Ever since the start of this tournament one phrase has been heard more than any other within the England camp. It is to “attack the tournament”. Don’t hold back, don’t play with the restraint of other England teams. Don’t be the team of Euro 2016 and many others.Southgate played in an era for England when the team spirit was undermined by club cliques. Yet on Saturday, when given a day off, Jordan Henderson, Danny Welbeck, Marcus Rashford, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jesse Lingard went together to the Divo Ostrov amusement park in St Petersburg. Or to put it another way, two players from Liverpool, two from Manchester United and one from Arsenal, all acting daft on a rollercoaster because they thought it was going to pull away before they had fixed their seatbelts. “You have to put club rivalries to one side,” Lingard said. “We have been like family. We all get along with each other and that’s why we have done so well. There is no squabbling. There are no cliques.”Back in training on Sunday Southgate was working on his 3-3-2-2 formation and, as is now the norm, his players finished with a mock penalty shootout that involved walking from the centre circle, one by one, to take aim from 12 yards. One potential problem is that Jamie Vardy and Rashford, two players who would happily take one, may not start the match. Jordan Pickford has saved three out of 25 penalties in senior football while Jack Butland has kept out four of the 25 he has faced (but none of the last 10) and Nick Pope, England’s third-choice goalkeeper, has the best statistics, with three saves out of 13.Pope is almost three inches taller than Pickford and it will be intriguing to find out whether Southgate would give any thought to bringing on the Burnley goalkeeper in those circumstances, providing England still had a substitute available. Southgate was unimpressed by Thibaut Courtois’ unflattering analysis of Pickford’s lack of inches after England’s 1-0 defeat by Belgium last week but it is true that a goalkeeper of considerable height and arm- can have a psychological advantage over opponents in a shootout.It is a tactic Martin O’Neill employed, for instance, in the 1996 play-off final for Leicester City against Crystal Palace. It was not needed, in the end, because of Steve Claridge’s last-minute winner, but O’Neill had taken off Kevin Poole shortly before to replace him with Leicester’s back-up goalkeeper, Zeljko Kalac, a 6ft 7in Australian who was known as “Spider” because of his long reach.“Six foot seven and useless,” as O’Neill described him. There is no inside information that Southgate is planning to do the same but, for all Pickford’s talents, Courtois’ comments have probably stung because they carry an element of truth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d886782a9fc76e9517308602d518c490d3a7ed41/0_27_7168_4302/master/7168.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f6bec051d043a87568b202a54931a50","title":"watch the world cup last 10 minutes christian sinibaldi","story":"Photographer Christian Sinibaldi captures the joy and despair in British living rooms, as fans from Iceland to Iran, Serbia to South Korea, support their teams. Interviews by Erica Buist and Deborah LintonPhotographer Christian Sinibaldi captures the joy and despair in British living rooms, as fans from Iceland to Iran, Serbia to South Korea, support their teams. Interviews by Erica Buist and Deborah LintonWhen Christian Sinibaldi turned up at homes across England to photograph fans watching the World Cup, he was overwhelmed by every nationality’s hospitality. “And their food,” he says. “I’ve eaten a lot of crisps and beer, but also the traditional Brazilian dish of feijoada in north London, Mexican quesadillas and guacamole in Putney, and a lovely Moroccan tagine cooked on the barbecue in Letchworth.”Sinibaldi sat with a fixed camera near the television screen and never asked anyone to pose: he didn’t need to. “Pretty much as soon as the match got under way, they forgot I was there.” He enjoyed watching the tension build. “Very few people left the room or changed positions throughout the game. They were glued to their chairs.”It does mean that Sinibaldi has not watched any matches himself, because he has been looking the wrong way. “But I could nearly always tell when a goal was coming – I could see it in their faces.” There’s a reason he made time for the project this year: as an Italian, it’s one way of dealing with the fact his home side didn’t make the cut.Rick Cooper, 41, and wife Jo, 41, sons Leo, eight, and Aaron, four, Malc, 44, Alison, 72Milnrow, RochdaleTiming is everything at Rick and Jo Cooper’s house, where the family are on countdown for England’s second match of the tournament, against Panama. With excited shouts of “Half an hour to kick-off” drifting in from the garden, the smell of burgers on the barbecue waft into the front room where the floor is strewn with balloons, inflatable clappers and St George’s flags.The country is in the early grips of a heatwave and little do the Coopers – grandmother Alison, 72, uncle Malc, 44, Rick and wife Jo, both 41, and their sons, Leo, eight, and Aaron, five – know that the sunshine will not be the only turn-up for England.Stones’ header puts England 1-0 up eight minutes in. “I missed it!” says Rick, distracted by Aaron walking in with lunch. But no one misses goals two, three, four or five – including two Harry Kane penalties – all before half-time. “This is unbelievable!” Rick shouts. “Football’s coming home.” The noise from the boys’ vuvuzelas is deafening. “The boys were too little for Brazil 2014,” says Rick, a Manchester United season ticket holder, “so I’m enjoying watching this one with them. I was obsessed with skiing as a kid. But France 98, where Beckham got sent off, that really got me into football and I’m mad for it now.”His brother Malc says, “You always have that hope with England, and it’s always been dashed. I remember Gazza with the tears at Italia 90, watching that with my late dad. And Maradona’s hand of God in 86, watching that on holiday in Torquay, around a tiny black-and-white TV. The injustice of it. But we’re perennial optimists, and with this young team, there’s a different mentality.”Their mother, Alison, is the only one who saw England triumph in 66. She says, “The country couldn’t believe it. My late husband, Henry, he loved the game. He always said: ‘If they play football, they’ll murder ’em.’ He’d have been thrilled with this one.”Kiki Machado and friends, Crouch End, London, 17 JuneCristina “Kiki” Machado’s house is a sight, and sound, to behold during the Brazil v Switzerland game, what with the yells of the 30 people squeezed into the living room, the guitar music from Kiki’s tenant Caco Barros (at front, glass in hand) and the green-and-yellow stars chalked on the pavement outside. “We drew six,” says Kiki (in hat), “because Brazil has won five times – we drew one more for luck.”Kiki’s living room is packed out with her “north London family”, friends collected over 20 years in this country, from Brazil, England, Lithuania, Serbia and Italy. When she arrived, her godmother gave her the number of her best friend’s daughter, Luciana, who was living in London. She never called, but seven years later they met by chance in the local library at a singalong for their children.“My family in Brazil said people aren’t celebrating there the way we are,” Kiki says. “It’s natural when you’re away from your country to find your people and cheer together.” She remembers as a child how everything stopped during a World Cup game, so when Martha asked if she could come home from school early for the match, she said, “Of course. Your teacher will understand.”After their 7-1 defeat by Germany in 2014, Brazilians are approaching this World Cup with trepidation. “I’m in defence mode,” says Janaína Campoy, 44 (on right, wearing glasses). “That game was a tragedy. It came just as things were going badly for us politically and economically. We lost confidence as a nation.”The self-esteem of an entire country seems a lot to put on 11 men, but they don’t let them down. After the match, they party until midnight, because that’s the Brazilian way to celebrate a draw. “When we won in 2002, that party lasted 24 hours,” Kiki says. “The hangover lasted a week.”Adama Karde and friends, Ancoats, Manchester, 24 JuneThe music and the chat don’t stop at Adama Karde’s city centre flat. Adama, 44 (in front of picture), a musician, came to the UK from south Senegal in 2008 and the green, red and yellow of his home country is all around his living room: on flags, posters and djembe drums.Watching with his partner Neilum Singh, 43 (second from right), and friends Iain Dixon (far right), 40, and Lamin Conteh, 42 (far left), Adama cannot hide his excitement. “Senegal is like Brazil,” he says. “Everyone plays football. When I was a boy, my neighbour was manager of the local team. He taught me, too – I’m a good player.”An early goal from Senegal superstar Sadio Mané sends them wild: the music and chants get louder, and the energy soars. When Japan equalise, Lamin booms: “It’s game on. Game on.” But when Japan equalise a second time, the mood deflates.“I wanted more,” Adama admits at full time. “They got the opportunity to win, but there were a few mistakes. They need to change tactics now.”For him, the World Cup couldn’t get much sweeter than 2002, when Senegal beat title holders France in the first game and reached the quarter-finals. He watched back home, crowded around a neighbour’s TV. “When Papa (Bouba Diop) pushed that ball inside, it felt as if we could beat anybody.”Neilum agrees: “They love their sport in Senegal. Because people have limited access to technology, they’re forced to share a TV, sometimes outside, sometimes in a cinema. Watching football with West Africans is electric – it’s just fire.”Before most Morocco matches, Mohammed Essakhi, 54 (in cap), finds himself in the kitchen cooking nibbles for friends coming over. He’s a school head chef and caterer, focusing on Moroccan and Spanish food. For this game, his starters include hummus, tzatziki and stuffed peppers. The barbecue comes after, “because when there’s a football match on, we want to watch it”.Balbair Chahal, 42 (pictured front left), works with Mohammed at the school Phil Moore, 56, and Amanda Brosnan, 50 (centre), are friends and fellow Leicester City supporters. They watch the game with Mohammed’s wife, Rosalind, 56, his nephew, Kaeran Duff, 30, his son, Nizar, 16, who is training with Watford and hopes to go pro, and his daughter, Azza, 22 (far right).The 1-0 loss to Iran is “a bit of a let-down”, because the team played well, says Mohammed. Azza points to an important difference: “Footballers in England are so famous – it’s good to see people from your own background compete on the same platform.”“I would love Morocco to win,” Mohammed says, “but realistically, it’s not going to happen. What would really make me proud is seeing Morocco host the World Cup. We’ve been asking for about 20 years.” His best football memory is the 3-1 victory against Portugal in 1986: “I was still living in Casablanca, and I remember youngsters celebrating in the street. Nobody thought it would be possible. At that time, Africa had only two teams that had qualified.”Naohiko Nishi (on right) and his eight-year-old son Atsuhiko (next to him) have no special food or drink, hang no flags, have no good-luck rituals. What they do have is a Japanese guidebook to the World Cup, with detailed information about every player: how old they are, what kind of a player. This is consulted very regularly.Today the Nishis – Naohiko and his wife Akiko (far right), their sons Atsuhiko, eight, and Takahiko, six (front right) – are watching the game with their friends Hiro and Shiho (on left), and their children Masa, 12 (on floor), and Iroha, nine (with giraffe). The children are keen footballers: Masa, Atsuhiko and Takahiko all play at the nearby Football Samurai Academy. Atsuhiko plays football three days a week, and says he hopes to play for Japan when he’s older. For him, the best moment of this game is Shinji Kagawa’s penalty, secured in the game’s sixth minute after a handball from Carlos Sánchez: “It was kind of scary before he took it – we were very surprised that we won.”His father agrees: manager Akira Nishino was appointed just two months before the World Cup began. “To be honest, Colombia is much better than Japan. They got a red card, which was so lucky for us. Winning this match was a great moment - because in the 2014 World Cup, Japan didn’t get a good result.” Though they were the first team to qualify, Japan failed to make it out of the group stages.For Naohiko, the joy of this competition has been watching Japan improve their standing on the world stage. “Japan didn’t join the World Cup until 1998. Only some of them played in Europe at the time - whereas now almost all the Japanese players play for Europe. The quality has got much better and their confidence has increased.”The win against Colombia, and a subsequent draw against Senegal, will be hard to beat, though Naohiko still holds dear his memories of the 2002 World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan: he was able to attend the opening game - where he watched Japan draw against a “very strong” Belgium.Shirin Azari and friends, Bromley, 20 JuneIf only Vahid Amiri, the Iranian striker, could hear the chant from the mothers, teachers and former students of Iyda, or the Intercultural Youth Development Association, a Farsi-speaking community in south London: “Vahid pa Talayii omide team e mayii (Goldenfoot Vahid, you are our team’s hope).” Sadly, his golden foot doesn’t save the day: Iran’s only goal in the game against Spain is offside and they lose 1-0.It is a women-only party, organised by Shirin Azari (behind sofa, in white Iran T-shirt) with friends in Bromley. “We often get together for food and gossip and chat,” says her friend Pupak Navabpour, whose children learn Farsi at Iyda. Food is the focus at these events, and it is all set up before people arrived, “so you can eat with your eyes first”.Shirin has made dolmas and Turkish burek, and serves them with rosebud and cardamom black tea brewed in a samovar, followed by gaz (almond nougat) and nabat (crystal sugar) on sticks. “That is what we do when ladies get together,” she says. “The group was singing Iran Iran by Arash, dancing and chanting in Farsi.”“I think Iran are really good at defence, one of the best,” says Shirin, “but not attack. Even if they try to score, there’s nobody there they keep themselves to their own goal.” Despite her criticisms, she is proud of her team, “because they don’t have the facilities or coaches that western countries have.”Pupak agrees: “It was gutting that the goal was disallowed. They defended well and almost scored a few times – even though they lost, I think they did quite well.”Pupak started taking Farsi classes as an adult when she realised she was beginning to struggle with her mother tongue. Now her children go every Saturday. “My youngest said, ‘But Mummy, I’m English.’ Even though I’ve spent most of my life here, I don’t feel that kind of belonging. When I watch Iran play in the World Cup, I suddenly feel that connection to home.”On 17 June, Serbia won their first World Cup game in eight years. The more superstitious might have the Bogdanovics to thank for it: “We sit in the order we were sitting in 2010, when Serbia won against Germany,” says Deanna, 47 (on left). “We try to recreate exactly what happened that day, so we can win in the future.” Serbian snacks must be on the table and everyone must dress for the occasion.Deanna and Brian, 47, moved to London 20 years ago soon they will have spent more of their lives here than in Serbia. “Often you question where home really is,” Deanna says, “but the World Cup erases that feeling. I’m not usually into football, but the World Cup turns me into a completely different person. When we scored,” she says of the winning goal, “it was such an amazing feeling. I don’t think we breathed for the last 10 minutes.”The only year-round football fan in the family is 15-year-old Vuk. Serbia haven’t qualified for the World Cup for more than half his lifetime, and he remembers being a small boy watching Serbia beat Germany. “Back then, Stojkovic was my favourite goalkeeper, and he saved a penalty. That was a proud moment.” His ritual during the game is never to jinx it by being overconfident: “Even if we were 3-0 up, I’d still keep my mouth shut until the final whistle.” Silla Johannesdottir and friends, London, 22 JuneIceland’s mere presence here is historic. The smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup, its population is the same as Sunderland’s. Silla Johannesdottir (on far right), who watches the game with her family and Icelandic friends, bearing flags and face paint, says, “It’s like a fairytale – we’re a tiny, tiny country. No matter how it goes, we’re so super proud of them.”But the game is disappointing, ending in a 2-0 loss to Nigeria. “When we got the penalty, there was a tiny bit of hope,” Silla says, “but Gylfi Sigurdsson didn’t score. That was a real low point, a kick in the gut. Everyone just left, there was no celebration. It was a bit sad.”What went wrong? “They were just better than us. They can run, those boys, and the Icelandic team just couldn’t keep up with that pace.”Her husband, Dadi Sveinbjarnarson (back right), agrees that speed was the Nigerian team’s strength. “The Icelandic team played pretty well, they had two or three tries on goal, and that was more than Nigeria, as far as I could see. Iceland just got outrun.”Dadi feels particularly connected to the team because he used to work with Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Thór Halldórsson, whom he describes as “a Viking shield wall”. “I was a commercial producer and he was one of our film directors. He is a very talented commercials maker who had a side life as an athlete – then that became the more important part of his career.” Halldorsson even directed a Coca-Cola commercial for the World Cup, using the famous supporters’ “Viking clap” as a lead-in.But Silla thinks everyone in Iceland feels connected to the team, and that even other nations have been rooting for them. “People approach us and say, ‘Well done.’ Everyone is happy for us. The World Cup really brings people together.”Erik Sarmiento and friends, Manchester, 24 JuneIn Colombia, football isn’t watched with strangers in a bar – it is a party to be shared with those closest to you, in your home. So Erik Sarmiento, 27 (sitting on the floor), is bringing South American carnival to inner-city Manchester by cramming 10 friends and family into his small flat to watch Colombia play Poland. The beers are flowing and a Colombian barbecue is on the go, with sides of guacamole, black beans, chimichurri and patacones (fried plantain) served with hogao (tomato salsa).The Spanish TV commentary is streamed at high volume and everyone’s focus on the match is unwavering, despite the noise of friends talking. An expensive bottle of Amarone wine sits by the television for final whistle celebrations.Erik, a business manager who lives with his wife Laura Van Hoof, 28, a Spanish teacher, came to the UK as a university student on a scholarship to learn English in 2009.“Growing up in Colombia,” he says, “sport isn’t associated with status or money because you can play in the streets. Colombia turns into a carnival when the national team plays. When I watch here, with Colombian food, music, friends, it’s a little bit of home in the UK.”The group play on bongo drums and improvise beats with a cheese grater, metal jug and spoons throughout the game. For 90 minutes, it feels as if the room is poised to explode – and it does, when Mina scores 40minutes in. “Goooooooooooal-azo,” they scream. By the third goal, they hug and sing: “Championes, championes, olé, olé, olé!”Erik says, “Football is an international language. I play four or five times a week – it’s how I met these friends. I saw someone wearing a Colombian club’s kit and now we are all watching together.”“The last World Cup was the first time in our history that we made it to the quarter-finals James Rodríguez was top goalscorer and won the golden boot which was a big thing for us. Now our expectations are high.”Yves Ogrodzki and friends, Cheltenham, 21 JuneStudies over the years have reported that the French aren’t the easiest folks to please. Chef Yves Ogrodzki, 53 (with glass in hand), and his sous chef Jeremy Denni, 21, aren’t doing much to subvert those findings with their assessment of France’s victory over Peru. “It was a bit weak,” Yves says, “they could have done a lot better than that. I didn’t find it very exciting really.” Jeremy agrees, pointing out, “We have some of the best players in the world, so 1-0 is falling short. There were moments I was scared we wouldn’t win.”Yves and his wife Elisabeth, 53 (on right), run a French restaurant in Cheltenham, and they have invited the staff to their home to watch the game. “We want to bring to our customers a proper French atmosphere, so all our staff come from France. They are all in their 20s, it’s their first time working abroad, so we very often organise little parties like this at home.”Yves prefers rugby to football, but finds the World Cup gives foreigners an opportunity to talk about their national identity. “I remember when France won in 1998, people felt very patriotic. But living abroad, there’s a new dimension to our identity. The World Cup brings everybody together while still having that thing that says, ‘I belong to that country.’ Even someone like me who is more interested in other sports, we still get to go back to our roots. And I like the jokes. I’ve seen people joking on social media that now Italy haven’t qualified, they can look after everyone else by delivering pizzas.”There’s no special World Cup dish, just your basic French delights: a glass of pastis, sausages with mustard from Dijon, some traditional Parisian baguettes with ham and cornichons. “To bring luck,” Jeremy says, “we all sing the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, before the game starts.”At the apex of a isive Mexican general election, nothing brings the country together like beating Germany. Yves Hayaux-du-Tilly (back right) watched the game with his sister and her Irish husband, his daughters, the nanny Maggie who has lived with them for 16 years, his sons and their friends. His wife, who was working, was sad not to see their win.“It was a brilliant game,” Yves says. “Mexico generally make it to the finals, but they normally underperform. This time they played brilliantly it wasn’t a consequence of a mistake from the German defence. We could have scored one or two goals in the second half unfortunately we didn’t, but we won. We defeated the world champions.”The family members have varying levels of superstition when it comes to the World Cup. José Pablo, 19, “will probably wear the same underpants and shirt without cleaning it every game the Mexican team plays”. They have to hang the Mexican flag and the beer has to be Mexican: “And of course we have guacamole, nachos, quesadillas – as an expat, it’s a way to connect with your country.”After the victory, Yves was in Mexico and found the mood of the entire nation lifted. “I was there three weeks before the game and everybody was angry and trying to convince other people to vote for their candidate. Now, nobody really cares about the election. We feel nothing can be that wrong if we can beat Germany. It changes the mood of the entire country. It’s very, very powerful.”Yves, whose best football memory is watching Mexico play at the Azteca stadium during the 1986 World Cup, thinks people will be talking about this victory for decades to come. “I love that the World Cup gives us this opportunity every four years to try again. That’s what life is about: you always have the opportunity to prove yourself one more time.”Ten days later, Mexico got through to the final 16, despite losing 3-0 to Sweden in their final group match. “It was a bittersweet feeling,” Yves says. “I was a little bit disappointed by the lack of character, focus, concentration and discipline in the players. But the main objective is to get through to what we call in Mexico ‘the fifth game’,” ie the quarter-finals. “That has only happened twice, only at the World Cups in Mexico,” he says. Yves did ultimately enjoy watching the Sweden match in a pub, largely because of the simultaneous Germany v South Korea game, which saw reigning champions Germany crash out of the tournament. “We didn’t care about our score,” he says. “We were all watching South Korea and when they scored we all cheered and hugged the South Korean fans.”Lee Jaeyoung and friends, Bradford, 23 JuneNo one gathered in front of Lee Jaeyoung’s TV thinks South Korea have a chance against Mexico. The group of international students are on a study abroad programme at Bradford University. “I asked my friends how they thought we would do,” says Jaeyoung, 27 (back left), who studies psychology, “and they predicted a 2-0 loss, or maybe 2-1 if we were lucky.” He is more optimistic, hoping for a draw, but in the end the 2-1 defeat comes as no surprise. “I saw Mexico play Germany, and the Mexican team is really good.”Before his friends arrived, Jaeyoung bought some beer and fried a load of chicken drumsticks – an extremely popular combination the Koreans call “chi-maek”, from “chi” for chicken and “maekju”, the Korean word for beer. “Unfortunately we couldn’t find Korean beer,” Jaeyoung says, “so we had Stella and someone brought Carlsberg. It was a really good time.” They hung up the Korean flag for luck.“I don’t watch football usually, just the World Cup,” says Kim Seungyeon, 21 (back right), who studies psychology and counselling. “It’s a lot like the Olympics in that if our team wins, I feel I’ve won, too. I know they work hard, so I’m really happy to support them.” For her, the moment to beat in World Cup history came in 2002, when hosts South Korea reached the semi-finals. “It was the best moment – a miracle.”Despite today’s loss, they are extremely proud of the team’s forward, Son Heung-min. “He got a really incredible goal during extra time,” says Jaeyoung, who is a huge fan of the Tottenham player. “After the match finished, I saw on the Korean news that he was crying in the locker room. I felt like shouting, ‘Don’t cry, Son! We lost but you were the best!’”He was similarly impressed with his team four days later, when they achieved the unexpected and won 2-0 against Germany, marking the end of the latter team’s World Cup. “I didn’t expect that kind of score,” he says. “It was really impressive.” The match was a 0-0 draw until the 92nd minute, which would have still resulted in Germany being knocked out, but then South Korea’s Kim Young-gwon scored: “And I was like, ‘What the hell? This is awesome,’” Jaeyoung says. The goal was ruled offside, then reviewed on VAR, allowed, and was swiftly followed by a second goal from South Korea. Even though the win didn’t change their knockout from the World Cup, the celebrations were exuberant. “We were screaming and dancing,” Jaeyoung says . “I just wish I had put a bet on.”Anastasiia Fedorova and friends, Catford, London, 19 JuneThe balloon is for Anastasiia Fedorova’s husband, whose birthday was a few weeks before the match. He chose to work an extra hour in order to miss the game. “He was absent on principle,” she explains. “He’s British but was born in Ukraine, so he doesn’t support the Russian team. Sometimes we have small political battles. If there was a game between Russia and Ukraine, it would be a nightmare.”Anastasiia, 31 (on right), and Polina Kaplitskaia, 29, studied at the same university, St Petersburg State in Russia, and four years later bumped into each other on a plane from London to Moscow and rekindled their friendship. They both came to the UK for love Anastasiia’s husband is British, and Polina’s husband Andrey had been living in the UK for 10 years when he met Polina through a mutual friend on a trip to Saint Petersburg.Polina has brought along red, white and blue paints to decorate their faces with the Russian flag. She thinks Egypt’s own goal, clumsily scored by Ahmed Fathi in the 47th minute, prompted a surge of energy on the Russian side: “I don’t think our team was concentrating very hard - but then Egypt scored an own goal and after that Russia started playing better. They became more active and confident.”“Our first goal was the best moment for me,” Anastasiia says. “I remember thinking, we’re so close to winning the game, and if we win we’ll go through to the next stage and it will be the first time in Russian history.” She hopes the World Cup will be good for the Russian people: “I hope everyone sees the real Russia, how the people are nice and welcoming. Sometimes our government does things that aren’t nice, but the people are not the same as the government. My parents in Russia say the atmosphere is so warm.”Living abroad when your country is hosting sometimes means missing out on the party, and Anastasiia felt sad when she saw Instagram stories showing people celebrating in the streets of St Petersburg. “We won and that was a surprise for everyone,” she says. “We’ve only won two games so far – but for us it’s like we’ve won the whole thing.”• Commenting on this piece?

The Seleção have hardly hit top gear yet in Russia, but as Nick Ames reports, there’s a feeling in the Brazil camp things are beginning to fall into place. Quite what they get from Neymar, though, remains open to conjecture. His performances (with a ball at his feet as well as those of a more theatrical nature) have been scrutinised as is custom for any player who carries the hopes of a nation on his shoulders – and for any player capable of doing things like this:And what of Juan Fernando Quintero? “I’m not fat I just have a big arse,” he once quipped to fend off constant hounding by the South American press about his weight at one point in his career. Now, Colombia’s hopes against England rest in part on the midfielder’s shoulders, after a sterling start to the tournament that has left his coach Joseé Pekerman heralding him as a genius. That and more in this fascinating profile of the player by Carl Worswick.There has been a lot of talk about this supposed “easier” half of the draw and the ramifications for England, who are set to take full advantage and definitely go on to win the whole thing now. But has anyone asked Swiss or Swedish fans how they feel about the prospect of facing England in the quarters? Or are they readying themselves for Colombia? Or are they not saying anything at all as they are mostly sensible people who are perhaps focusing on their team’s next game, rather than getting ahead of themselves and worrying what might lie ahead. “Let us get this clear,” Mark Jenkins writes below the line. “A majority of the England fans here are not saying we will beat Colombia. This will no doubt be how they will paint it if England lose. Imagined arrogant English supporters is everyone’s favourite past time. All we are saying is, *if* we beat Colombia, statistically (in terms of world rankings etc), we have an easier path to the final.”  To note: England have won just two knockout games since their run to the semis in 1990 – against Denmark in 2002 and Ecuador in 2006. Kieran Pender is in Nizhny Novgorod. He writes in to pose a question:“Can Croatia win the World Cup? They are a step closer after beating Denmark last night in a nervy penalty shoot-out, and with Russia next up the Croatians will fancy themselves to make the semi-finals at least. The team was far from vintage on Sunday, with chance after chance created by their star-studded midfield going to waste. Captain Luka Modric played in a deep-lying role – as he often does at club level but a change from his positioning from much of the group stage. Could a move further forward be required for Modric to lead Croatia to the final?”He also wrote this on Modric and the duel with his successor at Tottenham, Christian Eriksen, after last night’s game. “If you use this, please just call me ‘Rob’,” emails Rob. “When does the official debate about shootouts begin?” No time like the present Rob.  Italy, Holland, Chile, Ghana. Remember them? Proud football nations that have been forced to watch on from afar this tournament. But what’s it really like for fans in those countries? In a word: painful. “This ‘easier half of the draw’ stuff leaves me cold,” writes Usini below the line. “If England are good enough to win the World Cup it doesn’t matter who the opponents are, and the idea is to win, not to participate in the finals. In 1982, after a poor start, Italy won by beating Argentina Brazil and Germany.” No easy games at this level, and all that.For every Spanish tear shed though, there is a Russian equivalent. Who’d have thunk it, to borrow a terrible phrase. Well, perhaps Stanislav Cherchesov, for one. The Russia coach, fresh from a pre-match phone call from Vladimir Putin, masterminded the victory over Spain with a supremely gritty defensive performance which, truth be told, resulted in a pretty dire spectacle but also the result a nation so desperately wanted. And said nation seemed happy enough afterwards.Is that the official end of tiki-taka then? Andres Iniesta is no more an international concern, his final bow in a red shirt marking the definitive breaking up of that glorious golden generation and with it goes the incisive derring-do of the all-conquering 2010-vintage. As Barney Ronay writes:“There is too much talent in this team for Spain to be traumatised for too long by a last‑16 exit. But a style and a culture that has been beautiful at times, irresistible at others, felt as if it had reached an end point here.”Jonathan Wilson, as is his way, saw it coming four years ago. You have to feel for anyone who has the misfortune of being on the wrong end of a penalty shootout defeat. “The lottery of penalties” (don’t get me started on that as a phrase) is a cruel, cruel way to go out of a tournament. Just take a look at Sergio Ramos here, for instance, and tell me you don’t share his anguish. Anyone? Anyone? Away from the World Cup, there’s has been some huge news in the US today – LeBron James has agreed to a monster deal to play for the LA Lakers! It’s a massive coup for the Lakers, but sadly LeBron still won’t be the biggest fish in LA’s goldfish bowl – as Zlatan Ibrahimović has been quick to point out. It’s almost as if the retired Sweden international has a sizeable ego. With Spain’s exit, the “easy” side of the draw appears to have just got even “easier”. They should just go ahead and etch England’s name on the trophy now. Or not. It’s a topic that the podders get to grips with today, plus there’s the usual chat about players’ hair choices, the continuation of a discussion about World Cup’s shithousery, and Kasper Schmeichel’s balls. In short, essential listening.Another day, another opportunity to sift through the detritus of big upset. As we get our heads around the unlikely fact that Russia are into the World Cup quarter-finals (the quarters!), so too we must contemplate the demise of the 2010 world champions, and the end of a golden era with Andres Iniesta now stepping away from international football.As has become the norm in the modern-day game, there were plenty tears at the Luzhniki Stadium – Spanish ones, most notably from (and Liverpool fans, pull yourselves together here) Sergio Ramos, after a gut-wrenching penalty shootout defeat, but also from Russian eyes as the host nation, written off before a ball had been kicked, upstaged their more illustrious opponents to prolong what is an improbable journey.Few will claim it was pretty – the possession pie chart resembled a Spanish Pacman whose mouth was hardly gaping – but still, it’s the final scoreline that counts, right? Russia will now meet Croatia for a place in the semi-finals (the semis!) after another decisive shootout over in Nizhny Novgorod that was not kind to Denmark. Their coach said the outcome represented “the brutality of football”. It can indeed be cruel.Plenty more reaction to those results over the course of the next few hours, along with a look at ahead to the upcoming last-16 fixtures. Who will be today’s fall guys? Brazil or Belgium? Or both? Or will a degree of order be restored with victories over the underdogs of Mexico and Japan? There doesn’t seem to be a great deal of respect for the old world order, so you’d be forgiven for thinking anything can happen.Throughout the course of the dayeveningwhatever it is where you are, please do feel free to get in touch on email (mike.hytner@the) or Twitter (@mike_hytner) or below the line.

All visionaries need support to make their ideas a reality, and you need to find someone who will be by your side in business to execute your killer idea.The common misconception when you start a business is that you have to do it all yourself. Don’t! The most powerful people have an inner team making shit happen. In business, that executor is often the COO (chief operating officer).

How do you find these people? Go out and start talking. People are often afraid of sharing their ideas for fear of disapproval or even theft, but the best way to galvanise support is to share your big vision.

I like to break down my big ideas and list the key features. In the early days of Beautystack, I needed an app development team and funding. I wrote down the skill sets for those people, what I needed from them and how they could help me. I wrote down the profile of who the perfect person would be and how they could fit into my business.

I have rented for years as I have always assumed that I would never be in a position to secure a mortgage on my salary which is currently just under £30,000. However, my family have recently been able to offer me help with a deposit – a gift, not a loan - and I am now considering my options.

I’d arrived at Heaven nightclub, underneath the Charing Cross railway arches, on a hot Sunday afternoon to find my friends had already gone in – you didn’t risk hanging back and missing your chance – so I joined the queue of kids dressed in the acid house uniform of Day-Glo dungarees and smiley T-shirts. I must have had the heads up on the attire as I was wearing baggy yellow surf shorts I’d just bought in San Diego, a far cry from the carefully curated layers of black that usually passed as a clubbing outfit, but other than that I had no idea what to expect.The minute I was through the door I was swept into a cavernous room of flashing lasers, dry ice and sweating bodies. After the self-consciously cool West End club scene I’d dipped into in the mid-80s, the club night Spectrum was a revelation. From the moment you stepped on to the dance floor everybody loved you, and everyone was smiling and swigging out of each other’s water bottles. Girls crowded around the mirrors in the bathroom telling each other they were beautiful. A girl in a swimsuit tipped buckets of water over her sweat-drenched body. I’d never seen anything like it. All inhibitions and barriers seemed to have dissolved in a heady mix of youth, summertime, the magical new music and, no doubt, a new empathy-inducing drug, called ecstasy, that many people had begun taking.It’s 30 years ago this summer that acid house exploded in the UK, triggering what’s now called the second summer of love and the biggest youth revolution since the 1960s. As a Mexican wave of parties swept through London in a rush of joy and unity, a new world emerged from the swirl of dry ice and pulsing beats, one that was to shape our culture and outlook for the next generation.As Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream” speech echoed out over the dancefloor, the lasers cut in and a sea of hands reached into the air towards the DJ booth, I experienced something like a religious conversion. “This,” I thought, “is what I was born for.” Spectrum became my regular Monday-night haunt – that original party had been a monthly all-dayer – along with Future on a Thursday, both club nights started by the now legendary DJ and producer Paul Oakenfold. That first time I stayed all night and emerged squinting into the daylight, I went straight to my job at a fitness magazine with my ears still ringing, sure that I’d discovered this incredible secret.From that moment on, I was out every night in an underground playground of warehouse parties, sweaty basements, abandoned shops and derelict railway arches. Club nights popped up and disappeared again like shooting stars and there was always the possibility that the police would turn up and pull the plug or the sound system would cut out and then we’d tumble out into the cold night air and head back to someone’s flat.I don’t know how we heard about what was going on next. This was long before the internet and social media. It was as if there was a tribal drum echo on the street and soon I’d find myself in an abandoned coach station or sweaty basement in Camden locking eyes through the dry ice with a dancer from Cats, or a saucer-eyed plumber from Bromley. All barriers melted away. I met football hooligans who’d happily hug blokes from the other team as they “got on one” on the dance floor.Rave culture had ushered in a new era of weekday partying and my first priority was dancing: Spectrum, Shoom, The Trip, Future, the exception to the rule was Westworld’s Enter the Dragon, at the Park in Kensington, on Friday night, which offered a rare glimpse of glamour, with its tiered glass dancefloors, where models and Chelsea girls rubbed shoulders with Portobello market traders. Despite my busy school-night schedule, holding down a job hadn’t proved too difficult until my brother invited me to Ibiza where, after a weekend spent dancing on top of a speaker at Ku, under the stars at Amnesia and watching the sun rise on the terrace at Space, I called my boss on Monday morning to tell her I wouldn’t be coming back to the office, at least not that week. Two months later, I jacked it in to go to Goa where the party continued on the beach, dancing to electronic music surrounded by hippies who’d been there since the 60s.By the following summer, the genie was out of the bottle and the acid house scene had taken off in earnest with massive raves around the M25. My friend Tash, who I’d met on that first night at Spectrum, was working behind the scenes with a professional gambler called Tony Colston-Hayter on his Sunrise raves. It was her voice you’d hear when you called the BT phone line for directions to a secret rave location. There were parties in fields, at Didcot Railway Centre, in stately homes and, one memorable night, at a mansion in St John’s Wood, with a baby oil dance floor and a Rolls Royce in the drive. After the party, we’d carry on back at someone’s place. One day, after dancing all night in a field near Brighton, I led a convoy of cars to my dad’s house in Kent, where Norman Jay played in the garden.But the energy had begun to change. The tabloids had whipped up a moral panic in middle England and police vans would be waiting for us in fields as we drew up to the gates. The carefree spirit had gone out of it, at least it had for me. I got a job and started seeking out smaller, more grown-up clubs, like Graham Ball’s soulful Quiet Storm and Sara Blonstein’s glamorous Pussy Posse parties, which were incredibly creative, with their kissing booths, four-poster beds and “dating agencies”. You could say the acid house movement was pure hedonism, but bigger cultural changes came of it, as people began breaking away from the “greed is good” 1980s. That summer certainly had a huge impact on me. The bleak depression and feelings of isolation triggered during the last year of university, after a painful break-up, had lifted in the swirl of dry ice and smiling faces and, for the first time in my life, I’d truly felt part of something. Even now, 30 years on, I’m still drawn to that kind of optimistic energy and moments of connection and, like many of the friends I met that summer, it’s hard to stop me jumping up and down to an uplifting Balearic beat.DJ, 56, founder of Shoom, the club credited with spearheading the acid house scene in LondonThe inspiration for Shoom came from a trip to Ibiza to celebrate Paul Oakenfold’s birthday in August 1987. We went to this open-air, after-hours club called Amnesia where DJ Alfredo was playing and that was a pivotal experience. It was a combination of the spirit of Ibiza, the spirit of the people and this revolutionary new music, house and techno. We returned to London and sprinkled some of that Ibiza magic into the clubs we created. When I created Shoom in a basement gym in Southwark, it was a complete breath of fresh air. It was small and intimate and it attracted a group of like-minded people of all races, colours and sexual preferences, a mixture of art students, street kids and fashion people. It only held 300 people, but within a few months there were thousands waiting to get in.By 1990, the rave scene had deteriorated, but that first couple of years people felt like they were really part of a tribe. Acid house was completely inclusive, everyone was welcome and the attitude was infectious. I’m just very grateful to have pioneered that part of the scene.Danny Rampling is releasing Space Girl with vocals from Irvine Welsh this summer and hosting Summer of Acid at Club Paradiso in Amsterdam on 24 August. He is playing with DJ Alfredo at the Prince of Wales, Brixton, 7 July DJ, 59, co-founded the Boy’s Own fanzine, described as the “village newspaper of acid house”. He also hosted Boy’s Own parties with Andy Weatherall, Cymon Eccles, Steve Mayes and Steve Hall It was a brilliant summer, a beautiful summer. It was almost as if every week there was a standout moment. Everyone was so excited and into it. It was all about trying to do something where you’d go: “Wow, that was amazing.” All the DJs were trying to find records that would make perfect sense on E. So you had people looking for rare records from the 70s, 80s and even back to the 60s.I don’t think the acid-house culture ever really finished. Without it you would never have got garage and without garage you would never have got grime, so basically the biggest music in the world now owes a debt to acid house. Boy’s Own are doing a stage at the Farr festival, Bygrave Woods, Hertfordshire, 7 JulyClub organiser, 48, co-founded Energy, putting on raves for up to 25,000 people, with Jeremy TaylorBy the time we started doing the big outdoor raves in mid-1989, the police Pay Party Unit numbered over 50 officers and were following everything we promoters did. They even had helicopters circling the M25 on a Saturday looking for us setting up. Pretty much every party we did ended up causing quite a bit of disruption. Once we even closed down Heathrow when we set up behind Heston services. The police got wind of it and blocked all the approaching roads. People were parking on the M4 hard shoulder and scrambling up the banks to make a run for the fence, while police dogs were being set on them. It was pretty chaotic. In the end there were 10,000 people inside the party and 1,000 police outside. After that party, Jeremy and I were arrested by plain clothes police dressed like ravers in dungarees and driving a 2CV, with a smiley face sticker in the window. You really could not make it up.The Mirror labelled me an evil acid house baron and accused me of corrupting the nation’s youth, but I didn’t take much notice. We didn’t think what we were doing was so bad – a bit naughty maybe but not evil – we weren’t gangsters, we weren’t hurting anybody, and it felt as though people were behind us. Faced with a road block today, I think most people would probably turn around, wouldn’t they? What made us so determined? We were having the most unbelievable time, a unique experience, shared with hundreds and then thousands of people. Really nothing like this had happened since the 1960s.Tintin Chambers still works in the music businessClub organiser, 57, founder of the travelling art collective the Mutoid Waste CompanyWe were already doing parties in old warehouses around London when acid house hit. They were one-night festivals, with a heavy emphasis on the sculptural stuff, with cars hanging up, like a big adventure playground. It was this mad Disney World with no rules that was a Mutoid Waste party. Then Sex Two, who I’d say were the first acid house sound system in England, turned up and took over the old canteen block behind us in Battlebridge Road, King’s Cross. It was amazing: 5,000 people squashed in, raving away around a single lightbulb to Can You Feel It by Mr Fingers, an early Chicago house music classic. I thought: “Fucking hell, this is really something new. This is mad.” It blew everything open. Suddenly you’d have the City boys in their souped-up cars, the crusties in their old bread vans and everyone was on the same buzz. There was this weird synchronisation where all the different cultures and even the football culture came into it. We’re English and we’re very tribal – suddenly it freed us up from all that. Suddenly we were all on the same buzz, rushing away and feeling good and full of love. It was a fantastic thing, but in the end there were too many criminal gangs fighting over the action and that spoilt it a bit.People got too out of it on E, with brains like overcooked vegetables, and I think we paid for that. You can’t get enlightenment in pill form. You can get insights and moments of lucidity, but you’re not going to get it by partying every weekend, which is the same conclusion Timothy Leary came to with acid at the end of the 1960s.The Mutoid Waste Company has an exhibition at the Bruton Art Factory in Somerset, 30 June-31 JulyClub organiser, 47, worked on Sunrise raves giving out directions to the secret locations of the M25 partiesI was 17 at the time, so I didn’t have a job, but I was selling tickets to parties and raves to fund going out, which is how I met Tony Colston-Hayter who put on Sunrise.

It was my voice you heard if you were heading to the big raves that summer.The location was always a closely guarded secret until the last minute, so that the police wouldn’t arrive and shut you down. I was probably the most hated person in England whenever anything was cancelled or redirected. A particular moment of pride was when the BBC did a story on the orbitalM25 scene and they played my voice, giving out directions on the news.Occasionally I had to change the messages on location and that meant finding a phone box, though I must have had a mobile at one point because I remember climbing on top of a bus to get reception and telling people how to get past a police blockade on the way into an Energy party. There was usually a QC on site who’d give us legal advice and on that occasion the security led people through in big groups, peacefully, and there was nothing the police could do about it. It wasn’t illegal at that point. It was only when the media started demonising the scene that the police started arresting people. If it hadn’t been for that summer of love, I wouldn’t have met the incredible group of people I’m still friends with today, or my husband the DJ James Monro who says he first clapped eyes on me when I was dancing on a podium at Sunrise, though neither of us can remember which one. Now James and I run a small charity in Brazil for troubled teens and one thing that helps us to understand them is my experiences as a teenager.

The zenith came in February, when the 24-year-old singer dominated the Grammys with five wins, a record for a British woman. She couldn’t be in the US, because of visa complications, but when Tony Bennett, one of her heroes, announced Rehab as record of the year – beating Beyoncé, the Foo Fighters, Rihanna and Jay-Z, and Justin Timberlake – she was shown, by satellite linkup to London, staring straight ahead, mouth agape, briefly speechless.But there were many profoundly distressing episodes, too. Throughout the year, Winehouse battled her addictions to alcohol, crack and heroin, while a gleeful tabloid press documented every tumble from the wagon. Her live shows could descend into chaos and she was roundly booed at both V Festival and Bestival that summer.Blake Wood, then a 22-year-old proto-photographer from Vermont newly arrived in London, met Winehouse in early January 2008. They were introduced by their mutual friend Kelly Osbourne and quickly became inseparable – in red-top parlance, he was “Good Blake”, in contrast to Winehouse’s husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, who had not long been jailed for attempting to pervert the course of justice, though her relationship with Wood was always platonic (he eventually took legal steps to correct false reporting).Their friendship deepened and, on Winehouse’s invitation, Wood began taking informal photographs. After her death in 2011, he could scarcely bring himself to look at them, but now he feels the time is right for a different, more nuanced narrative of that surreal period. “A big reason I wanted to put this out there was to change the conversation about her,” Wood says of his new book, Amy Winehouse, a collection of 150 mostly unseen images, taken in locations from Camden to Paris to St Lucia, in 2008-09. “There’s a false idea that it was all bad during those years and it really wasn’t – I was there.”Wood, on the phone from New York, where he now lives, goes on: “This book, really it’s a love letter to a friend. And it’s a visual diary of us at the time when she was most celebrated by the world, but she was also really misunderstood. She was very much loved by the people around her, and I hope this comes through the work.”Certainly the photographs present a contrasting image of Winehouse from the one that filled the newspapers at the time, or from that of the doomed, self-destructive naïve from Asif Kapadia’s Oscar-winning documentary Amy. Wood says that he wanted to capture “the person, not the persona”. In many of the images she has her natural curly hair rather than the extreme beehive we are used to. The book is dominated by an extended holiday that Winehouse took to St Lucia at the end of 2008, which Wood joined her on for almost four months. Winehouse looks natural and healthy as she rides horses on the beach or exercises on a trapeze, and she appears totally at ease with Wood snapping away on Polaroid and old point-and-shoot cameras that he’d brought on the trip.By the time of the St Lucia holiday, Wood insists, Winehouse was done with hard drugs, but she was still drinking. Either way, Wood – who grew up around addiction but has always been straight-edge himself – didn’t want to document that aspect of her life. “It was this unwelcome friend she’d go deal with and then come back and we’d hang out,” he says. “I just had no interest in taking bad photos of her. Why take a photo of someone who’s struggling? As a society we’ve captured that, we’ve seen that, at least from my perspective. But maybe not. Maybe other people need to connect to that visually and they need to see it more. But for me, I’m good.”Before St Lucia, much of the time that Winehouse and Wood spent together was housebound, hiding from the paparazzi. They would watch TV, talk about their lives, sketch out their creative dreams once they made pillowcases from vintage T-shirts. “We were both outsiders and we connected on that,” says Wood. “When you grow up feeling like that, you don’t feel like you belong, that definitely brought us close.” Winehouse pushed Wood to do photography and it was her encouragement that led him to leave St Lucia and return to the States to pursue it professionally. “She really believed in my work,” he says. “She saw my abilities before I saw any of it. I didn’t really know if I was shit or not. But she pushed me to make work and it was really nice to have a friend like that.”When asked to pick a special memory from their time together, Wood selects the night of the Grammys, and the gathering of friends and family at the Riverside Studios, west London. There’s even been a suggestion that when Winehouse finally found her voice and made a speech – “To my mum and dad. To my Blake, my Blake incarcerated” – she was talking about Wood first and Fielder-Civil second.“I didn’t talk to her about it after, but you can jump to that conclusion if you like,” he says. “But when she won, it was the first time in my life I really cried from joy. Seeing somebody being able to experience recognition sober, they really deserve it, and to be able to really feel it. Just to see her whole family and how proud of her they were, to bear witness to that moment was really big. As much as it was televised and public, it was very intimate that night. It was almost like her own private ceremony.”Amy Winehouse by Blake Wood is published by Taschen on 27 July (£30). To order it for £25 go to  bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

When they have the all-clear, the tissue is put back and the women can go on to have babies naturally.For most patients the procedure is safe, but certain cancers, such as ovarian or leukaemia, can invade the ovarian tissue itself. This means that when frozen tissue is thawed and put back, there is a risk the disease will take hold again. For this reason, ovarian tissue freezing is rarely offered to high-risk patients.Susanne Pors and others at the Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen believe artificial ovaries could be a safer option. To make one, they used chemicals to strip donated ovarian tissue of all of its cells, including any lurking cancer cells. This left a bare tissue “scaffold” made largely of collagen, the protein that gives skin its strength. The doctors then seeded this scaffold with hundreds of human follicles, the tiny sacs that hold early-stage eggs.On Monday, Pors will tell the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Barcelona how the team implanted an artificial ovary holding 20 human follicles into a mouse and found that a quarter of them survived for at least three weeks. In that time, blood vessels had begun to grow around the ovary to keep it nourished in the animal.“This is the first proof that we can actually support these egg cells. It’s an important step along the road,” Pors told the . “But it will be many years before we can put this into a woman.” It could take five to 10 years of work before artificial ovaries are ready for human trials, she added.Nick Macklon, medical director at London Women’s Clinic, said that while there was a low risk of contracting cancer from frozen ovarian tissue, it is a danger that doctors take seriously. “There have been certain cancers where we can’t use this procedure because of this concern,” he said. “It’s an exciting development. This is early days for the work but it’s a very interesting proof of concept.”Stuart Lavery, a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital, added: “It’ll be very reassuring, if this work reaches fruition, that patients can have the transplantation knowing there is no risk of transplanting the cancer back into them. The beauty of this is that many of the women who have ovarian grafts go and get pregnant naturally, they don’t have to go through IVF.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91abbafa734ddfc272526f73e87f00a85b4f2be5/0_255_2427_1456/master/2427.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7a0c52f61d1bb02d69d7573552f9fb8","title":"home dna test kits race ethnicity dna ancestry","story":"Researchers raise concern over white people misunderstanding their minority roots: ‘It has no consequences for them’People who use home genetic testing kits to unlock the mysteries of their ancestry tend to “cherry pick” the results, relying on preconceived biases to embrace some of the findings while disregarding others, new research suggests. Home genetic testing has become a multibillion-dollar industry that has seen millions of people around the world sign up for swab kits in hopes of uncovering the secrets hidden in their genomes. Researchers at Vancouver’s University of British Columbia focused on how the results shape perceptions of race and ethnicity. They interviewed 100 Americans from various ethnic and racial backgrounds who had taken the tests, returning to them 18 months later to examine whether the tests had gradually shifted how they saw their identity.“I was surprised to find that, for most people, they didn’t adopt the ancestries suggested by the test,” said Wendy Roth, a sociologist and lead author of the study Those who did heed the results did so on a selective basis, she added. “They didn’t embrace them full-scale – they cherry picked.” Participants tended to embrace identities that they saw positively or that they thought others would accept. Test results that were disliked were simply rejected or ignored in some cases. “So it’s not like people were seeing this genetic information as being definitive. They were really allowing their social desires and influences to change how they reacted to it,” she said.One of the participants who identified as a white Mexican American before the test was found to have Native American, Celtic and Jewish ancestry. Researchers found he embraced his Jewish roots over the other ancestries highlighted in the test. Another participant was adopted and had always believed herself to be Native American. After the test suggested she had no Native American ancestry, she dismissed it as inaccurate and continued to identify as Native American anyway. A notable exception was among some of the white respondents, who were more likely to embrace new racial identities as long as they felt others would still accept them. “They were really excited to try on this identity that made them anything other than just white,” said Roth. Some of this might be explained by the type of person who takes this test, said Roth. “Many of these people were looking for a sense of belonging. They didn’t know where their family came from, many of them were adopted and they were just looking for a place to belong.” The findings suggest that genetic testing could end up reinforcing race privilege, said Roth, citing the example of someone who has always identified as white but now, based on the test results, takes on a new identity as white and black, or white and Native American.“It doesn’t have any consequences for them. They can try it on, mention it when it’s to their advantage and ignore it otherwise. So it doesn’t have the same consequences as race does for non-white people,” she said. “That can really lead whites in particular to think that race is like that for everyone.”Roth is now carrying out similar research on randomly selected samples to see if the findings – which hint at the myriad of social factors that plays into our concept of race – carries over. “It really emphasises to me that race is much more complex than just information that’s encoded within your genes,” she said. “Even if they are getting this information, they still interpret this information in terms of who they want to be, how they want to present themselves and what they think society will accept. And then they chose to either embrace it or ignore it based on that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4997a9d9f244bceb1aa859f8053e723a2480b35e/796_57_2759_1657/master/2759.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99620952eaeb37873bcca1cfb260d844","title":"lebron james free agency philadelphia 76ers nba","story":"LeBron James is leaving home for Hollywood and an iconic team.The NBA’s best player announced on Sunday night that he has agreed to a four-year, $154m contract with the Lakers, joining one of the league’s most storied franchises and switching conferences to try and dethrone the Golden State Warriors and grow his own legacy.For the second time in his career, James is saying goodbye to the Cleveland Cavaliers, who drafted James as a teenager in 2003 and must make do with winning just one title in the 11 years they had him. James won another two titles with the Miami Heat.James thanked Cleveland in an Instagram story. “Thank you Northeast Ohio for an incredible 4 seasons. This will always be home,” he wrote over a picture of the Cavs’ 2016 NBA title parade.His agency announced his agreement with the Lakers in a release. It was a stark contrast from eight years ago, when a poorly conceived TV special to announce his departure from Cleveland backfired and damaged James’ image.The game’s biggest star will now lead a young Lakers team run by Lakers Hall of Famer Magic Johnson that has been overmatched in recent years while rebuilding. But the Lakers will instantly rise with James, a three-time champion who after being swept by the Warriors in this year’s NBA finals said he is still driven and very much in “championship mode.” Los Angeles will also provide James with a larger platform for his business interests and social activism. He already owns two homes in southern California and has a film production company.This is the third time in eight years James has changed teams. After leaving Cleveland in 2010, he returned in an emotional homecoming four years later, determined to make the Cavs champions. The 33-year-old had previously said he wanted to finish his career in Ohio, and although he’s leaving again, Cavs fans are more forgiving after he ended the city’s 52-year sport title drought in 2016.James informed the Cavs on Friday that he was not exercising his $35.6m option and becoming a free agent. While in Los Angeles following a family vacation, he spoke to Cavs general manager Koby Altman moments after free agency opened on Sunday, and it appears that was more a courtesy than a chance for Cleveland to make one last pitch.The decision to join the Lakers was not a surprise to his innermost circle, with one person telling AP that it had been presumed for some time that he was headed to Los Angeles next season.James gave Cleveland something to remember in his final season. He played in all 82 regular-season games and then somehow carried a team that underwent several transformations to a fourth straight conference title and match-up against the Warriors. As has been the case in the past, James didn’t have enough help as the Cavs were swept, dropping him to 3-6 in the NBA finals a record sometimes unfairly used to compare him to Michael Jordan.His stay with the Cavaliers will best be remembered for 2016, when he rallied the Cavs from a 3-1 deficit in the finals to stun the Warriors. James helped seal a Game 7 win with a chase-down block of Andre Iguodala, the signature moment of a career that has shown no signs of decay.With the Lakers, James will be playing in the Western Conference for the first time and just down the Pacific Coast Highway from the Warriors, the team that has stymied him three times in the past four finals.The chance to play for one of America’s most storied franchises was appealing to James, who prides himself on knowing the game’s history. In Los Angeles, championships are the standard and he’ll feel new pressure in upholding the legacies of Johnson, Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jerry West and other Lakers greats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70424022bee61ba631b56c87be38f6118ffe652d/163_84_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63d919789f61daf64fdcedfbc380579f","title":"max verstappen wins austrian grand prix lewis hamilton retires","story":"Were any further evidence required that this season’s Formula One world championship may come down to the last man standing, the Austrian Grand Prix was surely enough to silence any\u0026nbspdoubters.Max Verstappen may have won Red Bull’s home race but with Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas both failing to finish for Mercedes it dealt the team a body blow. Hamilton’s title lead has disappeared and the British driver now faces the herculean task of refocusing and bringing his best to the British Grand Prix next weekend.Nobody could deny Verstappen deserved the victory, the first time Red Bull have won at the Red Bull Ring he ran the race to perfection. As he showed exemplary control, pace and skill while managing his tyres, others suffered from blistering that severely hampered their races.But he did so while Mercedes fell to pieces in more ways than one on a day described by the team as cruel and brutal. Bottas, who had started from pole, retired on lap 14 with a hydraulic problem linked to the steering while Hamilton ground to a halt on lap 63 with a drop in pressure in the fuel system. Hamilton saw his lead of 14 points swing to a single-point deficit to Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who finished in third, behind his teammate Kimi\u0026nbspRäikkönen.Yet Hamilton’s retirement was the culmination of a race that his team had already given away. After taking the lead into turn one, the British driver looked to have it in his pocket. But Mercedes once again made the wrong call when the virtual safety car was used on Bottas’s retirement.Ferrari and Red Bull took advantage and pitted but Mercedes kept Hamilton out. He had to stop under normal racing conditions and lost track position, emerging in fourth, behind Verstappen, now in the lead, Daniel Ricciardo and Räikkönen. Hamilton was frustrated and worse was to come as he pushed hard to try and make up places, overworked his tyres and was forced to take a second stop. He was at best looking at damage limitation but even that became moot when his car stopped.He was confused as to how the team had lost the lead, then frustrated he could nothing about it, and finally disconsolate. After the decision not to pit under the VSC, the team even took the unusual approach of having James Vowles, the chief strategist, take responsibility in an attempt to refocus their driver. “It is my mistake, just give us what you can,” said Vowles. “I have thrown away the win today.”The team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted it was not the usual procedure. “It was about extracting what was left in the performance in him,” he said. “Helping him out of the mind-loop of: ‘How can this possibly have happened?’”The real problem for Mercedes is that it is not an isolated incident. The\u0026nbspteam, so dominant in recent years, have shown signs of cracking now pushed by a resurgent Ferrari. It\u0026nbspcompounds a software miscalculation that cost Hamilton a win in Australia and the very similar decision not to pit him under the safety car in China that led to a Red Bull victory for Ricciardo.Hamilton had not had a DNF since Malaysia in 2016 and Austria was a harsh reminder of the challenge they are now facing. “That was a major wake-up call,” said Wolff. “This is exactly how motor racing can go it can be very, very cruel and we had all the cruelty go against us today and it just got us brutally.”Wolff admitted the VSC decision had been the moment they had lost the race but that the team has simply spent too long considering the options, raised by other teams being able to split their strategies and leave one driver on track.However Wolff was insistent the team would not be overreacting. “No, we don’t need to make changes,” he said. “The most important thing is to understand why an error happens. I don’t think we’d make an error twice.”There may still be worse to come. Mercedes do not think the failures will mean power unit component changes at this stage but have yet to fully assess the cars. If changes are required it will raise the spectre of grid penalties later in the season.Hamilton was understandably concerned that the team ensure it does not happen again. “It is the hardest weekend we have had for a long, long time, we will discuss reliability and the strategy call,” he said. “We have a lot of strategists and I don’t know how we can make those errors but James put his hand up. We have lost a lot of points either through bad calls or reliability.”In front of them Verstappen showed great poise and technique to take the win, his fourth but the first this year. It could not have come at a better time given that the young Dutchman has been forced to face questions about his driving style after a series of incidents this season.Typically, he was not reading too much into it. “It’s just racing,” he said. “Sometimes you have difficult moments and then you try to work hard and you keep working hard and you overcome the situation. It’s as simple as that.”But he could not hide his pleasure. “My fourth victory,” he added. “I\u0026nbspthink it’s a good one, very unexpected. I\u0026nbspthink they are always good.”Vettel came away with much more than he might have thought possible. Having started from sixth after a grid penalty, taking the championship lead will have been beyond his expectations. It has now changed hands between these two drivers five times this season and will doubtless do so again.For Mercedes and Hamilton the first step in claiming it back will be to pull themselves off the ropes and making sure they are up for the fight at Silverstone.Final Positions after Race (71 Laps): 1\u0026nbspMax Verstappen (Neth) Red Bull 1hr 21mins 56.024secs\u0026nbsp2\u0026nbspKimi Räikkönen (Fin) Ferrari 1:21:57.528\u0026nbsp3\u0026nbspSebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1:21:59.205\u0026nbsp4\u0026nbspRomain Grosjean (Fr) Haas F1 at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp5\u0026nbspKevin Magnussen (Den) Haas F1 at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp6\u0026nbspEsteban Ocon (Fr) Force India at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp7\u0026nbspSergio Pérez (Mex) Force India at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp8\u0026nbspFernando Alonso (Sp) McLaren at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp9\u0026nbspCharles Leclerc (Mon) Sauber-Ferrari at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp10\u0026nbspMarcus Ericsson (Swe) Sauber-Ferrari at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp11\u0026nbspPierre Gasly (Fr) Scuderia Toro Rosso at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp12\u0026nbspCarlos Sainz (Sp) Renault at 1 Lap\u0026nbsp13\u0026nbspLance Stroll (Can) Williams at 2 Laps\u0026nbsp14\u0026nbspSergey Sirotkin (Rus) Williams at 2 Laps\u0026nbsp15\u0026nbspStoffel Vandoorne (Bel) McLaren at 6 Laps.Fastest Lap:\u0026nbspKimi Räikkönen 1min 06.957secs on Lap 71."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54a2943038fe620208a2fae2c007689ad5799724/0_115_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=460af14a6c8dc57265e648f0633051b7","title":"tennis is due its own metoo moment judy murray says","story":"Highly respected coach says abuse in the women’s game is an open secretTennis is due its own #MeToo moment and women should be able to speak out about abuse they have suffered within the game, Judy Murray has said as Wimbledon begins.In an interview with the  before the tournament, which starts on Monday, the highly respected coach, whose sons Andy and Jamie are both former Wimbledon champions, said it was an open secret that there was abuse in the women’s game.“I think anybody would tell you that there are examples,” she said. “I think everybody who’s on the circuit would be able to name you something that isn’t quite right. It’s very easy for a young, inexperienced player to be taken advantage of ... I would certainly advocate for anybody who has been the victim of abuse in that coaching relationship to speak about it.”Asked whether she thought it would happen, Murray said: “It only needs one person to start it off.” Murray said that when women first begin on the tour they are often very young, their bodies are changing and they can be vulnerable and lonely, with little mixing between players compared with the men’s tour, where there is greater camaraderie. While supportive of women speaking up about abuse they have suffered, she warned that it was difficult to do so, particularly when young. When asked whether tennis would have its #MeToo moment, Murray said: “It’s really about the women getting to the stage in their life where they feel confident enough to speak out. Who do you speak to? “There should be an independent sports body, where players can go where they know someone will listen to them and they know someone will act on it – whether that’s emotional, physical or sexual abuse. Often you’re scared to speak because you think it will prejudice people against you.”She added: “If you’re a young female player and you’re travelling the world, you often have nobody to talk to ... I noticed how little the girls would go out for dinner together. “Players tend to spend most of their time with their coach or hitting partner and often they are guys – guys who are quite a bit older than them. Who do these young girls talk to if they have got emotional or physical problems? You can’t talk to a guy that you’re largely employing.”Since the inception of the #MeToo movement in 2017, after dozens of women accused the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, rape, harassment and misconduct – he denies any allegations of nonconsensual sex – it has spread to a wide range of fields. However, its impact on the world of sport has been limited. Probably the most high-profile instance was when Olympic gold medal winners McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles used #MeToo to reveal they were sexually abused by former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, who was already facing criminal charges for molesting other gymnasts. Nassar was later jailed for up to 125 years and still faces further charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f14df56d8cb33e9afd53f91181f8cff1a22fd635/1654_633_3233_1940/master/3233.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68dd46a8c4e1981a1560e9c7ef48d5de","title":"james acaster interview netflix series repertoire latitude","story":"Kettering-born James Acaster, 33, a drummer turned comic, has been nominated for the Edinburgh comedy award a record five consecutive times.

But if you take the teabag out, the cup of tea as a whole is weaker – and the teabag itself goes directly in the bin. That’s essentially it. You’d be amazed at how angry Brexiteers get about it. If you voted Leave, try not to lose your mind in the comments section or on social media about what’s quite a whimsical\u0026nbspmetaphor.You wear a different shade of corduroy in each show, colour-coded to the stage backdrop. Why?One website called it “Four Colours Corduroy”. It developed by accident. I gradually found myself wearing corduroy in autumnal tones, then started matching my outfit to the backdrop. Corduroy hits the sweet spot between jeans and slacks. They’re a trouser middleman. Smooth chinos seem like the natural next step.Your father, David, tweeted an underwhelming compliment about you that went viral: “He’s not for everyone but he works hard.” Did he enjoy Twitter fame?It was funny and my dad totally got why. People identified with it because a lot of dads are like that – proud and affectionate but somehow always bumbling the compliment. To be fair, it’s true: I’m not for everyone and I\u0026nbspdo work hard. It’s the word “but” that made it.More effusively, Billy Connolly said: “James Acaster on Netflix is a scream.” Was that flattering?It meant an awful lot. He’s an icon, someone I grew up watching, loving and being inspired by, so I was delighted. It was surreal and lovely.You were nominated for the Edinburgh comedy award five times in a row. Have you perfected your gracious runner-up face?It’s never an issue. It’s always been a nice thing. I was surprised to be nominated once, so five times is way beyond my expectations. Forget winning, I’m definitely proud of that.You appeared on Have I Got News for You recently. What was the gender split of your episode? Is equality improving in comedy?Three men and two women. There’s no excuse for panel games, other TV comedy shows or even live bills to be made up mainly of men. Most of the best standup I’ve seen in the last five years has been by women: Bridget Christie, Luisa Omielan, Rose Matafeo, Lolly Adefope, Lou Sanders, Felicity Ward, Hannah Gadsby, Kiri Pritchard-McLean… They’re obliterating it on the circuit and need to be seen on TV more. It’s getting better, but still isn’t enough. There’s a long way to go.You’re one of the headline comics at Latitude. Looking forward to it?Very much. Music festivals are a different vibe. You’re often on in broad daylight, with sound-bleed from bands. The audience might be sitting on the grass, chilling out and drinking. You have to adjust and embrace that, rather than being precious and fighting\u0026nbspit.Will you be sticking around for the rest of the festival?Possibly, but I won’t be camping. I absolutely loathe sleeping in a tent, regardless of the weather. If it’s hot, you wake up at 6am, boiling, sweaty and somehow panicky that you’ve overslept. You want to get out but you’re naked, so have to wash yourself with wet wipes before you can emerge. If it’s raining, it’s even worse. It’s gross. Why do we do this to ourselves?Your shows have had one-word titles. Will the next one be the same?This new show is a deliberate departure. It’s called COLD LASAGNE HATE MYSELF 1999, all in caps lock.

Our writer is also struck by the story behind a statue – and it’s not of a mermaidI arrived at Copenhagen’s Central Station with Danny Kaye’s voice blaring in my head. Maybe he was right when he sang about wonderful Copenhagen. When you get off the train, after a 15-minute journey from the airport you are greeted by the turrets and rollercoasters of a huge theme park. Within seconds of tugging my case across the concourse, all I could hear were the squeals and screams from the funfair rides of Tivoli Gardens (opened in 1843) opposite.This is Denmark, consistently one of the top five countries in the annual World Happiness Report and home to one of the planet’s most famous storytellers, Hans Christian Andersen. Now the country is pushing for hygge – its unique formula for cosy comfort – to be given world heritage status by Unesco. It’s much in evidence as soon as I check into my hotel, the Radisson, where I relax in my 18th-floor corner room with a cup of organic coffee and a fluffy cinnamon pastry. From my window I can see the whole of the city and beyond, to the bridge that connects Denmark to Sweden.The Radisson, opened in 1960, is a Copenhagen landmark: the “SAS” (Scandinavian Airlines) emblazoned on its tower harks back to the time when it was a glamorous airport satellite, complete with a check-in desk and departure lounge from here, passengers were transported by bus to the runway. Today, the departure lounge is a supermarket, but the hotel has just been refurbished and returned to its 60s heyday. It was the signature work of seminal Danish architect and designer Arne Jacobsen, who designed its interior as well as its exterior – even the door handles and the cutlery are by him. The lobby is dominated by a giant spiral staircase that seems to hang from a vast circular hole above it.Jacobsen was most famous for his chairs: among his best known are the Swan and the Egg, and there are plenty of examples of both, including some rescued from an auction in Oxford. The Swan was the designer’s bar-chair, a seat in which to preen and be seen the Egg is a nurturing haven to curl up in. While the whole hotel is a shrine to 60s design, true aficionados can step into the decade itself with a visit to Room 606 which has been kept exactly as Jacobsen left it.There’s more Jacobsen at the Design Museum across town, where a permanent exhibition tells the story of how Danish design became a world leader. There are more than 100 chairs – armchairs, folding chairs, wooden chairs, steel chairs – as well as ceramics, glass and jewellery from the 1950s and 60s.Design fans should also head for Blox, a glass-encased boxy structure that aspires to be a city under one roof with a museum, offices, gym, restaurant and housing. The first thing I see when I arrive is a vertical play area with parents sitting around in the sunshine, their children climbing through rope mesh and frames and whizzing down slides. The whole place is a microcosm of the Danish spirit and its urban inventiveness. There are apartments on the top floors, open-plan offices where meetings are in progress, classrooms where school kids learn about design, cool shops and exhibition spaces.Blox is the new home of the Danish Architecture Centre. Welcome Home (an exhibition that runs until 23 September) looks at how domestic space has been moulded to the changing realities of family life. Other shows explore Danish design through film and furniture, but the true permanent collection is the handsome city all around the centre. Blox is as appealing to locals as it is to visitors.The cafe spills out of the building across a huge waterside terrace local designers and artists sit discussing their projects at tables next to tourist families talking about the sights. On the menu, smoked fish smorrebrod (open sandwiches), a Danish signature dish, sit alongside Nordic dolma, kohlrabi and herbs – a savoy cabbage stuffed with cracked wheat, broccoli and lovage, topped with horseradish and sour cream. There’s also baked cod on caramelised celery root purée, and baked aubergine with haydari purée (bell peppers and feta) and to drink, there’s always Carlsberg, whose brewery in the city can be visited for a tour and tasting (entrance €13.40, beer tasting €10.70).The influence of Noma, the city’s most famous restaurant, can be felt all over Copenhagen (Blox’s other restaurant, Blox Eats, is owned by Noma’s co-founder Claus Meyer). Which is a good thing, because there’s precious little chance of getting a table at Noma: not only is the place booked up for the foreseeable future, but even to secure a reservation costs from a cool £265 per person. Coming soon are special student deals at £130 a head. Students must be a lot wealthier in Denmark than in the UK – but then again, everyone must be a lot wealthier. It’s a magical, delightful place, but life is expensive: even in the humblest cafe, a coffee costs around £4, a beer is a fiver, and a light lunch with a glass of wine can easily set you back £35-40.For a more affordable meal than Noma, try one of the city’s newest restaurants. Trio is at the top of the newly opened Axel Towers, apparently designed to look like a pile of copper coins. The bar overlooks the Danish Confederation of Industry building, which is transformed at night with a colourful light show – lumpfish roe and radish on a blini with a glass of champagne while watching it was one of the highlights of my trip. No trip to Copenhagen would be complete without a barge ride from Nyhavn, the colourful 17th-century canal waterfront district, which takes you to see a glimpse of Denmark’s most enduring mascot, the Little Mermaid statue commissioned in 1909 by beer baron Carl Jacobsen after he attended a ballet performance based on a fairytale by the same name penned by Hans Christian Andersen.For such a landmark, the sculpture is small and underwhelming much more interesting, for me anyway, was the recently unveiled statue to Mary Thomas, who led an uprising against colonialism in Saint Croix, then in the Danish West Indies in 1878. Her punishment was a prison sentence in Copenhagen, which she served a mile or so from the waterside plinth where she now sits triumphant, the only memorial to a black woman in a city where the vast majority of the statues are of white men."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/376dea68fe949ea1da7b303ac56da935560db097/138_0_3972_2385/master/3972.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db925dec8df83442d0070efda3d6b558","title":"the misadventures of romesh ranganathan review high alert in haiti","story":"Celebrity travelogues are not my favourite TV genre, but if I have to go somewhere, I don’t mind going with RomeshDuring a clearout the other day, I came across a couple of carved wooden figures I had forgotten about. I got them a long time ago at the Iron Market in Port-au-Prince. I cannot remember whether they had anything to do with voodoo, but when I got home I did not like them as much as I thought I did when I was (probably) having a pathetic and (almost certainly) unsuccessful attempt to haggle for them in a hot market a long way from home. They went into a box. It is probably why my life has been cursed ever since.I went to Haiti because I was young and stupid and thought it would be an interesting place for a holiday. It was interesting, to be fair, but it did not feel much like a holiday. Mostly, I remember wondering what to do and pretending not to be scared.Romesh Ranganathan does not even pretend he is not scared. “Having spent the 14-hour flight imagining the myriad of ways I might get killed, I arrived in a state of high alert,” he says. Actually, I think he is pretending to be more scared than he is (he has got a security guard with him), but then that is his shtick, better and funnier than the other way around, the macho way. And it is sort of the point Romesh is going to the places others avoid because of their reputation. He is also going to Ethiopia and Albania. Albania? I thought it was the new Croatia!Anyway, he arrives at his famous Port-au-Prince hotel, which has scary voodoo figures in the garden (“I mean, that is genuinely terrifying,” he says, not sounding that genuinely terrified). In the morning sunlight, he cannot even pretend to be scared by them. “Look at that, there’s a penis with spines on it,” he says, pointing at a penis with spines on it.Romesh hooks up with local journalist Jeremy Dupin, who shows him around. They go by tuk-tuk, listening to raboday music (a sort of Haitian grime), to the area Jeremy grew up in and meet a few of his mates. It is loud and chaotic. And they drop in on Marinad 007, the raboday artist whose song they were listening to before. I hope Romesh returns the favour if Jeremy ever comes to London. Stormzy? Sure we can, we’ll drop in for a cup of tea … Marinad 007 turns out to be a man of few words it is a bit awkward. But he performs for them. Romesh gets involved and comes in with a few English bars: Oh my gosh, I’m here with a MarinadRomesh, and you know that I’m super badI’m with the mic, here with JeremyTo get me off the mic you’re going have to bury meI’m here, I’m not HaitianMy name’s Romesh Ranganathan.Ha! Love it. And that it’s not all about the history, colonialism, the Duvaliers, Tontons Macoute, but about what’s happening in Haiti, culturally, today.It is about poverty, and the 2010 earthquake, because it is impossible for a visit to Port-au-Prince not to be. And Romesh is clearly (certainly more believably than the fear thing) shocked by some of the things he sees. But he manages not to be hand-wringingly worthy about it. I like the way he is with people – not all overly polite because they’re poor and foreign, but just the same as he is with everyone else, deadpan – and if that sometimes leads to misunderstandings and awkwardness, well that is all right. It is – he is – very funny. And he gets a nice thing going with Jeremy – teasing, warm, genuine, that one I do believe. It is not my favourite TV genre, the celebrity travelogue, but if I have to go somewhere with someone, then I don’t mind going with Ranganathan.He does go to the Iron Market, which has been badly damaged in a fire (Haiti really doesn’t get any luck, does it?) since it was rebuilt after being completely destroyed in the earthquake. He gets a load of stuff: a small chair, seven brightly coloured scarves, good-luck shampoo, rum, black fish, etc, that he needs for the inevitable voodoo ceremony. Which takes place away from town at what looks like a lovely place by the sea. Obviously, the ceremony is absolutely terrifying … Is it really, Romesh? He is honest about Haiti as a tourist destination at least. It might not be for everyone. That sounds about right.My wooden figures? Well, they must have had something to do with voodoo, because I did what we do with unwanted stuff in my area I put them out on the pavement in the hope that someone would take them away. And someone did, since when things have gone relatively well.

At the event, the group, which included Geert Wilders of the Dutch Party for Freedom and Harald Vilimsky of Austria’s Freedom party, launched their campaign ahead of the European elections. Le Pen, with whom Salvini has nurtured a friendship for some time, warned that a far-right majority in the vote could “change Europe”.The party’s anti-immigration policies currently have the upper hand within the coalition, with Salvini reiterating on Friday that Italy’s ports would be closed to all NGOs involved in rescuing migrants from the Mediterranean for the entire summer, a period when arrivals peak, and that those on board “will only see Italy in a postcard”. His renewed pledge came the same day the EU’s 28 leaders struck a deal on how to handle refugees and irregular migrants. The deal was reached amid intense pressure from Italy and after a ship carrying over 600 rescued migrants was forced to ert to Spain after Salvini blocked entry.Salvini said his government’s tough approach towards immigration and in negotiations with the EU had achieved more than its predecessors had done in six years.“The happiness of a people comes first,” Salvini proclaimed at the rally, drawing rousing cheers. Salvini asked rally attendees if they would “swear, yes or no, to liberate the peoples from this Europe”.“Yes!” came the resounding reply from the crowd.

The men now face up to 14 years in prison for possessing classified documents relating to military operations in Rakhine State, charges they deny.The killings they uncovered occurred during the military crackdown that caused more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees to flee to Bangladesh, and that the UN has described as “ethnic cleansing”.The two journalists were detained on 12 December after they met with police sources at a restaurant and were handed the documents. They have been held in prison ever since, while preliminary hearings have been ongoing. Government prosecutors are seeking charges under the Official Secrets Act. Defence lawyer Than Zaw Aung said this week the court will hear an application for discharge from the defence and then decide if the case will proceed or not. The hearing begins on 2 July.It is a trial that has prompted outpourings of condemnation from the UN, human rights groups and even Pope Francis, who called for their release, saying: “The right to information is a right that must always be protected.”Local journalists have repeatedly called for the release of the men, holding rallies in front of the court with reporters wearing black armbands and shirts with the words “journalism is not a crime”. The prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney has spoken out about the case, saying: “The outcome will tell us a lot about Myanmar’s commitment to the rule of law and freedom of speech.”Last week, Stephen Alder, the editor-in-chief of Reuters, called for an end to the prosecution. Speaking to the , he said: “They have been imprisoned for too long on false accusations.” Alder said the case was “a wholly unwarranted, blatant attack on press freedom”.Both journalists have remained optimistic throughout their incarceration. Wa Lone has become known for giving a double “thumbs up” whenever he walks into court for trial and Kyaw Soe Oo for using every opportunity to embrace his young daughter as he enters and leaves the courtroom. “I completely believe the truth will come out,” Wa Lone said in handcuffs leaving the court on 18 June.The trial has exposed the continued control of the military in Myanmar. Matthew Bugher, head of Asia Programme for Article 19, a human rights group that defends freedom of expression, said the government has demonstrated that “it will go to any length to silence those seeking to expose the truth about the grave human rights situation in Rakhine State”.Thirty-five journalists have been arrested or charged under the current government and local journalist Hline Thint Zaw Wai said the current trial shows that the government lacks the will to protect journalists. De-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi recently broke her silence on the case in an interview with the Japanese broadcaster NHK, saying the reporters “were arrested because they broke the Official Secret Act”.The case has been marked by inconsistencies and contradictions throughout. In April, police captain Moe Yan Naing admitted in court that the documents were planted on Wa Lone to “trap” the journalist. Moe Yan Naing paid the price for his testimony and was given a sentence of one year in jail for violating police discipline. His family was also evicted from their police housing.More recently, a police witness was accused of violating police code as he copied statements from previous witnesses. A witness to testify against the two Reuters journalists also failed to show up to court on 12 June.In May police took information from the journalists’ phones and submitted it to the court.Shawn Crispin, south-east Asia representative from Committee to Project Journalists, criticised this handling of information, saying it jeopardises the confidentiality of sources. “Obviously there is a grave risk that information taken from journalists’ cell phones could be tampered with or otherwise distorted,” he said.When asked for a comment on the case, the Myanmar government spokesman, Zaw Htay, was not immediately available for a comment. Previously he has said he trusted Myanmar’s courts would conduct the case according to the law.Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are the newest faces on a museum wall dedicated to political prisoners in Yangon. They appear next to monks marching for democracy, student protesters and poets who were imprisoned for writing prose against the military regime.“I remember when Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said one political prisoner is already too many,” says Zaw Moe, who spent five years in prison for taking part in the student protests.“They should not be on this wall,” Zaw Moe adds, shaking his head."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4808b58a332d9db6edcbb6815bb4f4e7d726004d/0_471_3057_1834/master/3057.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=138a4331c1c82be0f3b554cbeeab0919","title":"jacinda ardern new zealand welfare reforms baby","story":"Prime minister, who is on six weeks’ maternity leave, says families package is her proudest achievement so farJacinda Ardern has welcomed sweeping government reform for families in a video filmed while she is sitting on her sofa, cradling her baby, Neve.The families package was a core part of Labour’s campaign promises, and aims to make New Zealand “the best country in the world to raise a family”, as well as lifting 64,000 children out of poverty by 2020.In the video, Ardern said the package was her proudest achievement as prime minister so far.On Sunday paid-parental leave increased from 18 to 22 weeks, and to 26 weeks from July 2020.Babies born on or after 1 July will be eligible for a NZ$60 a week payment for the first year of a child’s life, with some families able to claim the payment till the child reaches three years old.Since giving birth on 21 June, Ardern has been on maternity leave in her Auckland home with partner Clarke Gayford.In her first video since being discharged from Auckland hospital on 24 June, Ardern is pictured sitting in her living room, cradling her daughter in a woollen blanket.“This is my permanent state at the moment, either breastfeeding or this,” Ardern said, glancing at her sleeping daughter.“I’m glad no one could hear that just now!” says Ardern later in the video, laughing and glancing again at her baby.There were more than 3,000 comments on Ardern’s first video since returning home, the overwhelming majority of them supportive and encouraging of the new mother and prime minister.“A prime minister wrapped in a blanket with a new baby still putting her country first,” commented Audrie Scott on Facebook. “You are setting new boundaries prime minister!”Towards the end of the video Ardern took time to respond to questions from viewers, replying by name in real time.“Karen, I’m doing really really great thank you, I promise. I was waiting for anyone to say I look tired. I promise I am not too bad I really just don’t have any make-up on, so that’s probably why I have a bit more bags under the eyes than usual ... but we are doing great, we are doing really great.”National party finance spokeswoman Amy Adams said 1.7 million New Zealanders would be worse off under the families package. “Changes such as higher fuel taxes, rent increases and higher income taxes are costing Kiwi families over $100 a week,” said Adams. “And that’s an unacceptable burden on New Zealanders who are trying to get ahead.”Ardern signed off her video in typical fashion – with a smile– and promised to read through the thousands of comments soon. “But in the meantime I am going to sit here with my human hot-water bottle, and thanks everyone for the lovely messages.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c3fdf5408e7c13d5d928b8ecc10836389d65e5a/0_206_5165_3099/master/5165.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=667e0896a31fdd26448f2a7b1f6df935","title":"myanmar not ready for rohingya to return red cross chief says","story":"Peter Maurer says much more preparation needed before large-scale repatriation is realistic Conditions in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine state are not ready yet for the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who have fled a military crackdown, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Sunday after visiting the region.Myanmar has said it is ready to take back the more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled Bangladesh since August last year. It has set up two reception centres and what it says is a temporary camp near the border in Rakhine to receive the first arrivals. Maurer’s comments, made at the refugee camps on Bangladesh’s south-eastern coast, followed his visit to Myanmar, where he said he saw abandoned villages and destroyed houses. A Myanmar government spokesman was not immediately available for comment on Maurer’s remarks. The exodus of Rohingya came after militant attacks on Myanmar security posts triggered a military offensive that the United Nations has called a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing”. Myanmar has denied the allegations and stated it waged a legitimate counter-insurgency operation. Red Cross has become the main provider of humanitarian aid to Myanmar’s northern Rakhine state since the UN had to suspend its operations there in September last year, following government accusations that its agency had supported Rohingya insurgents. Rohingya who have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar have reported mass killings, arson and rape by security forces there. The country does not recognise the Rohingya as an indigenous ethnic group and denies them citizenship. The United Nations struck an outline deal with Myanmar at the end of May aimed at eventually allowing hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims sheltering in Bangladesh to return safely and by choice. But Rohingya will have no explicit guarantees of citizenship or freedom of movement in Myanmar, according to details of the agreement Reuters reported on Friday. Many Rohingya living at the refugee camps in Bangladesh have said they will not return until Myanmar recognises them as citizens and their safety is guaranteed. The government did not respond to enquiries about the agreement. Maurer said he said he met senior government officials in Myanmar’s capital, Naypyitaw, to seek approvals to increase Red Cross operations in Rakhine state. He said he was satisfied with the cooperation from the security forces as well as the government to reach people in need."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3547008.1530195823!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sky s the limit customer foiled as he tries to cancel broadband contract","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRepeated calls to Sky failed to produce the desired response for the frustrated customer. Photograph: David JonesPAA reader named Paul Davy got in touch because he wanted us to know about what he called Sky’s Hotel California policy, a policy which, he says, means “you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave”.He has spent much of the past 12 months trying to cancel his Sky broadband account to no avail so far and in his mail he promises a “quick” version of the story but – to be honest – it is not at all quick so you might want to settle in.“I was approached by an eir salesman in May 2017 as they were installing fibre in our remote area of Co Galway and he advised that if we didn’t sign up with eir we’d be waiting more than two years for Sky fibre,” his story starts.Davy says he found the salesman “a bit pushy”, and having had Sky TV for eight years and its broadband for around three years “albeit with miserable download speeds” he decided to contact\u0026nbspSky before he signed with eir.He did that on May 25th last year “and they confirmed I was out of contract but also advised that if my neighbours were getting fibre from eir then there was no reason that Sky couldn’t provide me with fibre – more or less rubbishing what the eir salesman had told me,” he says.So he renewed his contract with Sky “on the clear understanding that what they were telling me was correct”, he says.“I can still hear myself spelling that out as a condition of renewal and Sky reconfirming that if my neighbours have fibre I’ll have fibre through Sky. I was even willing to wait one or two months for the fibre.”He never got his fibre. He called Sky “a few times” over the next few months, each time giving them a history of events, and each time he says he was given conflicting information.Last September a Sky agent confirmed the company couldn’t provide fibre in his\u0026nbsparea “as eir had pulled in new lines to my neighbours and hadn’t released them yet to other providers. As I was running a home office on still miserable download\u0026nbspspeeds I cancelled Sky broadband and phone that day”, Davy says.He was, however, persuaded to keep the TV package with the promise of a discount. Then he signed up for eir fibre and phone and the Sky agent confirmed that he would send the cancellation request to the relevant department.He got his eir fibre installed a few days later “without any hassle”, and all was well. Then he realised Sky were still taking the full amount of direct debit out of his account when they should have only be charging him for his discounted TV package.He contacted Sky again on October 6th. An agent confirmed his cancellation had not been processed but she said she would contact the Cancellation Department and ring him back that day. The agent did not call back that day but he missed a call from her the following day “and she left a message to say she’d call me the following Wednesday – four days later”.The call came as promised. The agent said there would be an early disconnection charge as I was cancelling “in contract”. Davy disputed this and asked for transcripts of his calls with Sky to prove his case.“The forms I was supposed to sign requesting the transcripts never arrived and I let it slip for a while as I was very busy in work and didn’t have time during the day to be still following this up,” he says.Then in early January “with full direct debits still going out to Sky” he spoke to another agent and went through the story again.Time passed and he contacted Sky again as the transcript request form wanted him to submit £10 (sterling) when returning it. The company confirmed they’d sent out the wrong form and that he shouldn’t have to pay anything and that they would send out a new transcript form in the post.“I finally got the transcripts in the post toward the end of February 2018 but it came in the form of 40 pages of every transaction and call in Excel format, a hard copy of emails sent to me and a CD Rom – hello – who still has a CD player on their laptop in this day and age? I mean Sky can reboot your TV from India so you think they could email me the call recordings? I also had to call Sky again as the form requested €5 this time – I was told that I was misinformed and that there was a €5 fee but if I paid it that Sky would credit me for same.”Again Davy let it slip for a spell as he was very busy in work “and needed to source an old laptopPC with a CD player. But when I finally did source one last weekend, the security ‘passphrase’ they emailed me separately to open the CD did not work. I’ll be contacting them yet again today advising of same, but either way I know I renewed in good faith on the basis that Sky could offer me fibre like eir.”Apart from the efforts to get the transcripts he has also contacted Sky on numerous occasions to cancel his broadband and having been as polite as humanly possible all along, “on one occasion I finally lost it a little when pitted against an alpha male supervisor who had raised the tone of our conversation to a higher level, when I uttered the words \u0027get your head out of your ass for a minute\u0027\u0026nbspit was duly followed by \u0027I’m now terminating this call\u0027. I mean I work in construction and that’s about the least vulgar thing you can say to someone in conversation,” he says.“On another occasion I was told I could only cancel Sky exactly a month before the renewal date and not before. So I did ring Sky on 25th April 2018, someone in the Cancellation Department listened to my summary of the whole fiasco and confirmed that she’d process the cancellation herself, do a follow-up on the 14th May 2018 to make sure it went through and also confirmed when I asked the question that \u0027nothing can go wrong\u0027\u0026nbspwith it this time”.“He did call back 10 minutes later and promised to sort things out within the Cancellation Department and call me back later that day. I haven’t heard anything from anyone in Sky since and am beginning to think that this is some kind of sick game that the Sky Cancellation Department play on people or maybe it’s just with me.”He says what he would like is the cancellation of his broadband, a refund of his money, and “an official apology from Sky to acknowledge that you can’t treat people like this and you can’t continually give them misinformation depending on what operator they’re talking to”.He also said he would like “compensation for the wasted hours on the phone where you’ve got to psych yourself up to make the call in the first place, go through their voice recorded options, utter the words “Cancel Broadband” for the umpteenth time when they ask you to clearly describe how they can help you today, relay your life story to another poor unfortunate Sky operator who you know sympathises with you but are only doing their job and probably have another 10 or 20 Paul Davys to listen to after your call finishes”.We got in touch with the company and received the following statement.“Having investigated the case highlighted we wish to apologise to the affected customer. We pride ourselves on providing customers with a high standard of customer service and acknowledge that the customer’s experience in this instance did not meet those standards. We have reached out to the customer and have resolved this matter.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin s pride parade wows the city as thousands take to the streets","story":"  June 30, 2018This year\u0026rsquos event marks 25 years since the decriminalisation of homosexuality   June 30, 2018LGBTI+ activists express concerns that the event is now more of a festival than a protest   July 2, 2018None more gloriously cynical about creeping commercialisation than LGBT+ community "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550478.1530485096!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"do the right thing and observe hosepipe ban says taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: “I really would appeal to people to heed the advice and not to use hosepipes”.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe .Irish Water is increasing its phone line staff numbers in anticipation of reports of water wasting as the hose pipe ban comes into force across Dublin.A month-long ban on the watering of gardens, washing cars or boats, and filling pools from public water supplies, using a hose, comes into force in the capital on Monday.Paddling pools can still be used, but only when filled with buckets from a tap, not a hose, and while domestic ornamental fountains cannot be filled, commercial fountains can, Irish Water said.Using a hose to fill or replenish ponds will also be banned, except where the pond contains fish.The ban in the capital will initially last until July 31st, but could be extended, Irish Water said. It was likely that similar orders would be implemented in other parts of the country in the coming weeks, it said.The primary purpose of these orders was to “mobilise maximum public support” for water conservation, it said.“Irish Water is backing up these orders by increasing the number of call centre agents to take calls from the public and we will follow up such reports.”People who wish to report incidents of excessive water use should contact Irish Water on 1850 278 278.A spokeswoman said the utility would follow up the report, but would only take action where they did not receive a positive response from the householder in question or there was “excessive and continuous usage” or water.If Irish Water decides to take enforcement action, a notice will be served on the person alleged to have breached the order giving them 21 days to pay a sum of €125. If this sum is paid, then a prosecution will not be taken.“Irish Water does not want to take people to court, but will have to review its options in the case of a persistent breach of the order combined with a refusal to pay the on-the-spot fine, ” it said.“We expect that most people will be ‘law abiding’ and that the order will be adhered to by the vast majority of the public. We will act in cases where there is excessive and continuous usage, but we would hope that this will be in only a small number of cases.”Irish Water can produce 610 million litres of water per day to serve the Dublin area.Last summer, an average of 565 million litres of water per day was used. Demand shot up to 615 million litres in the middle of last week but moderated in recent days to 582 million litres.Irish Water said some of the fall was down to businesses being closed and households being away over the weekend.“Usage remains well above normal for the capital. We are appealing to the public and business owners as they return to work tomorrow to continue to conserve water to protect water levels in our reservoirs,” it said.“While Irish Water can currently produce up to 610 million litres per day, at these levels all headroom is exhausted and the sources, particularly Pollaphuca reservoir on the Liffey is being drawn down at a rate that puts supplies at risk later in the summer and into the autumn.”A total of 120 water schemes across the country are at risk from drought and could face hosepipe bans. Night-time water restrictions are in place in 39 areas, and tankers are redistributing water around reservoirs.Both rural and urban areas are at risk of drought , Irish Water said.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550184.1530459659!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"just three nurses recruited this year for hse relocation package","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAccording to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, there were 15 nurses recruited last year, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015. Photograph:  Frank MillerJust three nurses have been recruited so far this year as part of the HSE’s relocation package.The “Bring them Home” campaign was put in place by the HSE in July 2015, offering Irish nurses working in Britain a relocation grant of €1,500 to return to the Irish public health service.Since April 2017, an additional €1,500 is paid after a period of 12 months employment and subject to a commitment to remain in that employment for a further year. Last year, it was decided to extend the package beyond Britain to include nurses from any overseas location.There were 15 nurses recruited last year, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.The HSE said upon its announcement three years ago it was hoping to attract up to 500 staff under the initiative.Irish Midwives and Nurses Organisation general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said that while it was important to have packages to incentivise Irish nurses to come back, the current offering was insufficient.“The figures demonstrate that it doesn’t go far enough, it has to be much higher. In addition, the incentive to stay also has to be included,” she said.“What we found is some who availed of the first part of the incentive left after six months. Recruitment is only one part of the story – retention is an even bigger part. The rate of pay is too low within a global market where you can get better rates.”The HSE said it could not provide a comment on the figures at this time but pointed to the health service employment report published last May, which showed a 4.6 per cent increase in the number of nurses employed over the previous year, from 36,474 to 38,139."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550450.1530476322!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"up to 24 medical negligence cases since 2002 include confidentiality clause","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky Phelan refused to sign a gagging clause so as to allow other affected women to be told. Photograph: Nick BradshawConfidentiality clauses have been stitched into as many as 24 medical negligence cases settled out of court over the past 15 years, the State Claims Agency director has said.Appearing before an Oireachtas committee, Ciaran Breen said there were “perhaps two dozen” clinical cases where settlements were made with a condition that the patient did not reveal the circumstances involved.The number of cases involving gagging clauses since the Health Service Executive (HSE) adopted a policy of open disclosure has been “virtually nil”, he added.The HSE’s open disclosure policy, official guidelines on telling patients and their families when something has gone wrong in their healthcare, was adopted just five years ago but it is not mandatory.Cian O’Carroll, solicitor for Vicky Phelan, who exposed the CervicalCheck scandal, said there are potentially other scandals lurking behind the dozens of confidentiality agreements.“I can say that on the basis that I personally strongly suspect that there is a very significant scandal lurking behind the BreastCheck figures,” he said. “That is the starting point, after that whatever else is there has yet to be uncovered.”Mr O’Carroll said BreastCheck “tacitly admitted” in recent weeks there are concerns over potential missed diagnosis in its screening programme.Prof Ann O’Doherty, national clinical director of the programme, told an Oireachtas committee last month that she had received 15 solicitors’ letters within two weeks over legal issues, when she would normally only get one a year. She said she feared spiralling legal costs could lead to the screening service being shut down.Mr O’Carroll, who represents a number of concerned women who have contacted BreastCheck seeking their records, said any settlements would come from the State Claims Agency and not from a cancer screening programme. “It may well be that some of the 24 cases involving confidentiality clauses relate to BreastCheck.“They should come out now and start notifying the women where they have knowledge of significant delay in diagnosis and treatment.”Mr O’Carroll added that it would be “immoral” not to inform women and families where there was such knowledge.Appearing before an Oireachtas committee on finance, public expenditure and reform, Mr Breen said “up to when we started to espouse open disclosure as the proper thing to do, there were probably occasions where confidentiality clauses were put into settlements”.“Without going back over inidual cases, I am guessing that, of the 8,500 clinical cases we have resolved, no more than a dozen and a half or perhaps two dozen were in that category over all those years.”Mr Breen said the period he was referring to was from 2002 onwards.The cervical cancer scandal was exposed when Ms Phelan, who is terminally ill, refused to sign a confidentiality clause as part of a €2.5 million High Court settlement with US-based Clinical Pathology Laboratories, which missed her cervical cancer during a 2011 smear test carried out by CervicalCheck.Ms Phelan (43) was diagnosed with cancer three years later and a 2014 audit showing her original smear test to be inaccurate was withheld from her by CervicalCheck until September 2017.She refused to sign a gagging clause so as to allow other affected women to be told.Mr Breen said the State Claims Agency had opposed the use of a confidentiality clause in Ms Phelan’s case.Asked for a response yesterday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the HSE said it would need more time to consider the issues raised so as it could answer in a meaningful way."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550321.1530468105!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"reject bigotry foster asks orange order members on scottish visit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tArlene Foster at the County Grand Lodge of East of Scotland district meeting in Cowdenbeath, Scotland. Photograph: Jeff J MitchellGetty ImagesDUP leader Arlene Foster has appealed to Orange Order members to reject bigotry and intolerance as she addressed a march in the Scottish town of Cowdenbeath.Speaking at the County Grand Lodge of the East of Scotland’s Annual Boyne Demonstration on Saturday, Ms Foster used William of Orange’s victory in 1690 as a lesson to modernise unionism.“This country needs to be a shared place where people are able to live free from intolerance and hatred,” she said.“Such bigotry was not part of King William’s mindset and it should not be part of ours,” the DUP leader continued, before adding: “Nor directed towards us either,” in a possible reference to anti-Orange Order graffiti and posters that appeared in the town overnight, including graffiti mocking the 66 victims of the Ibrox disaster in 1971.Other speeches from the stage risked undermining Ms Foster’s calls for a more modern, tolerant Orange Order. One Orangeman referred to James Connolly, a signatory of the 1916 Proclamation and a leader of the Easter Rising, as a “terrorist”, before shouting “No surrender”.Another, wearing a sash and a chaplain’s collar, said: “There are many in this town who are not only enemies of this institution, but who are enemies of Christ.”Following her attendance last week at the GAA Ulster final in Clones, Co Monaghan, and an LGBT event at Stormont, Ms Foster’s planned appearance in Scotland had provoked intense interest.A DUP spokesperson said: “It’s a much more routine event than it has been viewed.There’s no link or relationship between ourselves and the Orange institution, other than quite a number of DUP representatives are members at home, and there are quite strong links between Northern Ireland and Scotland.”Prof Graham Walker of Queen’s University Belfast said her attendance could be read as an act of solidarity with Scottish unionists, or as a statement by the Orange Order of renewed political relevance.“The Orange Order want to say to people in Scotland: you’re not going to get rid of us. We’re a player. And here we have the leader of a political party who holds the balance of power at Westminster,” he said.Prof Tom Devine of the University of Edinburgh said the Orange Order was an import from Ireland. “When Irish immigration started in the 1790s to Scotland, into the mid-19th century, about a quarter to a third of all Irish immigrants to Scotland … were actually Protestants rather than Catholic.”Standing outside Cowdenbeath’s only Catholic Church, Fr Dominic Clovis expressed bafflement at the way this historical entanglement between Ireland and Scotland was expressed. Fr Dominic, originally from London, has been in Scotland for a year. “I don’t understand. My dad’s from a Caribbean country, and there is no sectarianism there. There isn’t such a ide.”Back in the field, several unofficial stalls sold loyalist and Rangers memorabilia, including a maroon T-shirt with the Parachute Regiment crest and the words “No apology. No surrender”, a reference to Bloody Sunday in Derry in 1972.Peter Smith (68), a souvenir seller at a nearby stall, was sceptical of Ms Foster’s call for an end to bigotry. “That will never happen” in Northern Ireland, he said. In Scotland, however, he saw no problems between Catholics and Protestants: “Scotland’s fine. It’s just a load of banter. Northern Ireland’s a different kettle of fish.”Not everyone sees it as banter, and Ms Foster’s attendance placed pressure on organisers to ensure no scenes of drunkenness or sectarian singing. More than 100 police officers lined the route as Orange lodges and 40 bands marched through the town for two hours.One banner struck a very different tone in Cowdenbeath on Saturday. In a quiet act of protest, Cara Hopkins (28) hung a sheet painted with the words “Love not hate” from the balcony of her home as the march passed.“I feel angry. Really angry. Everyone has the right to protest and the right to march and express themselves. But it’s disrupting the whole town, and no one was consulted about it,” Ms Hopkins said.“This will be portrayed by the media as loads of support for the Orange lodge. No, there’s loads of curious five-year-olds and tired mums who are bringing them out to look at the ‘pretty colours’. It’s not a fair representation.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550276.1530478945!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"un security council role has earned ireland international respect","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland’s 2001-2002 membership of the UN Security Council, dominated by the response to the 911 attacks, was the last time Ireland held one of its 10 non-permanent seats.Richard Ryan, Ireland’s permanent representative at the United Nations, was preparing for the second week of the Irish month-long presidency of the UN Security Council on the afternoon of Sunday, October 7th, 2001, when an urgent call came through from the UN’s situation centre.It was UN secretary-general Kofi Annan telling him US secretary of state Colin Powell had just called to say American and British military forces would precisely two hours from then strike targets in Afghanistan in response to terrorist attacks on the US a month earlier.“And Richard, it’s over to you,” Annan told the veteran Irish diplomat in a slightly softer voice.Here was the ambassador of a small state, through its temporary membership of a global body responsible for maintaining world peace, thrust into a key role: Ryan had to lead the UN’s response to a developing international conflict that, if handled incorrectly, could blow up into something much bigger.Ireland’s 2001-2002 membership of the council, dominated by the response to the 911 attacks, was the last time Ireland held one of its 10 non-permanent seats. It will not be the last if the current Government has its way Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Monday formally launches the Irish campaign for a seat for 2021-2022.The challenge Ryan faced that Sunday afternoon in the residence of the Irish “perm rep” on Manhattan’s Upper East Side 17 years ago is typical of the tasks that come with membership.Article 51 of the UN charter requires any member state that attacks another to report to the presidency of the council and yet Powell’s call was to Annan, not Ryan, as the council’s president.He interpreted this as possibly President George W Bush but certainly vice president Dick Cheney, defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld and fellow hawkish “neocons” choosing not to become “entangled” with the council and particularly two permanent members, China and Russia, who were certain to object.Fearful of the potential civilian casualties heading into the Afghan winter, Ryan wanted the US to engage with the council in order to set up a co-ordinated UN humanitarian response.“We have a job here,” Ryan said he told Annan. “We have to bring them into the council but obviously we are going to have an uphill battle.”Ryan later made his case to John Negroponte, the US ambassador to the UN.“If you don’t take this suggestion seriously, you will be attacked for the famine and all the humanitarian disaster that will be happening and you will not be able to do anything about it because you will be in there on strictly military terms,” Ryan told Negroponte, according to the Irish man’s account.A flurry of phone calls later, after missiles began flying in Afghanistan, Negroponte called Ryan to tell him: “I think Irish diplomacy is beginning to work.” At that, Ryan lined up a call by then minister for foreign affairs Brian Cowen to Powell.The article 51 letters setting out the justification for the action subsequently landed on Ryan’s desk. The US was in. Ryan recognised US diplomats were “putting their heads into the lion’s den, totally against the advice of Cheney and Rumsfeld”.In retrospect, he believes the episode created “a template for the future”. Ryan said Annan told him that he believed “no other country” could have persuaded the Bush administration to engage with the UN but Ireland.Coming to the table saying Ireland had no agenda was key, said Ryan. “Everything was transparent, everything was clear,” he said. “We weren’t upsetting anybody but the system was already working before troops met each other in the field in Afghanistan.”Ireland’s membership of the council – the third occasion since 1961 that the Irish have held a seat, each falling roughly at 20-year intervals – was dominated too by responses to the civil war in Angola and the creation of a new country, East Timor. It put Irish diplomats in the front line of international relations.Critics question the cost and effort required from years of lobbying, including the endless meetings, wining and dining for Ireland in foreign countries, to win the temporary seat.An Irish diplomat once joked there were “no crustaceans left on the sea bed” after the culinary hospitality showered on foreign envoys during the campaign to win a seat 20 years ago.Wesley Boyd, the former  diplomatic correspondent, described the campaign to win a security council seat last year as “an expensive vanity trip”.Brian Cowen, minister at the Department of Foreign Affairs the last time Ireland held the council, rejects the view it is a “bookkeeping exercise” carrying a cost for the Irish purse.“What we derive from this and the standing it brings is not to be underestimated,” he said. “There is a value there that is not on the balance sheet but that is there in terms of the respect for the country and its ability to participate and work to solve problems well beyond our own shores.”Frank Smyth, director of the UN policy unit at the Department of Foreign Affairs, worked at the UN the last time Ireland was on the council. He says membership not just allowed Ireland to develop a higher profile with all 192 other UN member states but helped strengthen bilateral relations with the five permanent council members – the UK, the US, France, China and Russia – at political and official levels.“For many countries, the UN is the forum where they are most likely to see Ireland and form an impression of us,” he said. “By acting fairly throughout our term and by handling the heavy council agenda with competence, Ireland left a legacy which enhanced our national standing more broadly.”Cowen says the experience of serving on the council over the past four decades has allowed successive generations of Irish diplomats to develop skills to operate at the highest level.“It is not simply a question of prestige, although it is a prestigious thing,” he said. “The sort of training and experience it gives our diplomats on the front line of international politics is of huge benefit in the longer term to the department in how it serves the country and the network it builds up.”Ryan says the Irish voice is “particularly listened to” at the UN, and Irish diplomats carved out a reputation of speaking carefully, in a considered way and of being effective, fast-moving and transparent.“We are a small country with a big eye, small but broad-shouldered. We are not afraid to approach difficult delegations and countries.”The 15-member United Nations Security Council is one of the six main organs of the UN and is primarily responsible for maintaining international peace and security.It is the most powerful body in the UN system. Unlike other UN organs, only the council has the power to make decisions that member states are obliged to implement.There are five permanent members of the council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Ten non-permanent members are elected by the UN General Assembly for two-year terms.RussiaSoviet Union has used its veto powers the most out of the five permanent members of the council. It has used its veto 12 times to shield the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, a key ally of the Kremlin, since the country’s civil war began in 2011.The US has begun using its veto again under Donald Trump’s presidency in support of Israel. The British and French have not used their veto powers for almost 30 years.If elected to the council, Ireland would hold the monthly presidency of the council at least once during its term as it is rotated alphabetically among the membership."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550368.1530470887!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk s business secretary holds out prospect of longer brexit transition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSecretary of State for Business Greg Clark.

Business secretary Greg Clark said during a visit to the port of Dover that evidence should dictate when Britain moves away from the status quo in terms of alignment with the EU.“At all times we need to be guided by the evidence on this. Speaking to the people that run this very successful port ... in order to make sure that we can continue the success, and that we don’t have frictions, there are things that would need to put in place,” he told Sky News.“Computer systems, for example, posts at the border, even if they checked number plates. What we need to assess is how long it would reasonably take to put in practice, and then it seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence.”The cabinet will meet next Friday at the prime minister’s country residence at Chequers, ahead of the publication next week of a white paper outlining the future relationship Britain wants with the EU. More than 30 Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers have written to Ms May telling her to show “courage and leadership” and to stand firm against calls to compromise with the EU.“Our departure must be absolute,” the letter states. “We must not remain entangled with the EU’s institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation. Anything less will be a weakening of our democracy. Britain must stand firm.”Housing secretary James Brokenshire said on Sunday that he was confident that ministers would unite around a common position at Friday’s meeting. And Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers said that cabinet disunity could lead to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister. “The danger of disunity at the top of the party is not just that it makes the prime minister’s job more difficult in negotiations with Brussels, and therefore puts at risk the good Brexit deal that is in reach,” Mr Brady wrote in the Observer. “It also gives an impression of ision to the country. Electorates these days are volatile, but one thing is certain: they do not vote for ided parties. They rejected decisively the ided Tory party in 1997. If we were to let Labour in again, it would be a disaster for this country.”Mr Corbyn is under pressure from anti-Brexit groups in his party to back calls for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, as a poll showed most members of the Unite union wanted a second vote. Members of Momentum, the grass-roots group that backs Mr Corbyn’s leadership, have also called for a fresh referendum but the Labour leader on Sunday resisted the demand.“We have not proposed it, we have not supported it and we are not proposing it now,” he told Sky News.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Japan’s yakuza gangs are adding the unlikely – but lucrative – act of illegally exporting sea cucumbers to their portfolio of criminal activities.A growing number of yakuza gangs are reportedly ersifying into Japan’s flourishing sea cucumber market, by fishing for the sea creatures before selling them abroad, mainly in Hong Kong and China.Sea cucumbers, widely regarded as a culinary delicacy in Asia, have long been popular overseas, with Japan\u0027s total exports valued at £143.8 million (21 billion yen) last year.The nation\u0027s yakuza have increasingly focused on this market in recent years, with sea cucumber poaching creating as big a revenue for some gangs as amphetamine trafficking, according to a source cited in the weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun.The government is keen to clamp down on illegal exports, with the Fisheries Agency recently unveiling plans to create the first catch certificate system of its kind in order to regulate domestically-caught sea cucumbers.Yakuza are usually involved in drug smuggling, money laundering, and prostitutionThe new system, which the agency hopes to launch by 2020, will result in customs officials requesting certificates of origin issue by prefectural associations in order to cut down on illegal exports of the culinary delicacy.Japanese police currently face the challenge of having to catch sea cucumber smugglers in the act of committing a crime, with yakuza gangs often fleeing the scene on high-speed boats or simply dumping their catch back in the sea, according to media reports.Last year, the boss of Yamaguchi-gumi – Japan’s largest yakuza organisation – was reportedly fined £686,000 (100 million yen) for possession of 60 tonnes of sea cucumbers.Meanwhile, three years ago, the authorities uncovered an illegal sea cucumber racket in Aomori prefecture, northern Japan, valued at an estimated £1.3 million (190 million yen).Sea cucumbers are regularly eaten pickled in Japan, although they are often dried before being exported across Asia, with average export costs of around £192 (28,000 yen) per kilogram, according to Jiji Press news agency.Please review our commenting policyArtificial human ovaries created for first time in major breakthrough for infertile womenLeading piano competitions ban teachers from jury over rigging fearsAngela Merkel in showdown over migration deal as interior minister Seehofer announces he will resignKim Jong-un \u0026#39blasts workers at factories for not working hard enough\u0026#39The 8 things you might have missed this weekendComment: Why ban skirts when schools could simply make every uniform option available to all?Mexico\u0026#39s leftist Lopez Obrador wins largest landslide in country\u0026#39s historyNorth Korea expands weapons facilities despite US pressure to disarmIstanbul gay pride march hit with tear gas as Turkish police try to enforce banCheryl Tweedy and Liam Payne announce split, saying baby Bear \u0026#39is our world\u0026#39Prince Charles lends favourite family portraits for birthday exhibitionCouples paying £60,000 for surrogates despite UK system of \u0026#39reasonable expenses\u0026#39 onlyNHS pays moonlighting medics five times as much as Theresa May to plug gaps Poldark, series 4 episode 4, review: heartbreak and intrigue sees Poldark return to form14-year-old boy stabbed on busy London street in broad daylightRural families have a lower chance of getting on the property ladder than those living in citiesThe Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan, review: a refreshingly different travelogue with a potty-mouthed Michael PalinWinston Churchill was \u0026#39probably sexually abused\u0026#39 as a boy, House of Cards creator claimsMexico goes to the polls as candidates pray for peace -

before condemning its present-day workforce for failing to live up to that “proud tradition”. Instead of complaining about a lack of funds and equipment, the workers should put more effort into modernising their facilities by themselves. He added that the employees needed to increase their productivity.Kim Jong-Un visits the Sinuiju Chemical Fibre MillOn a subsequent visit to another nearby textile factory, Mr Kim criticised the staff for not making repairs to their crumbling buildings, saying the “precious” facilities looked more like a stable. Management of the two facilities appear to have got off lightly, however, as Mr Kim is notorious for a short temper and draconian punishments for those that displease him. Kim Jong-un inspects the Sinuiju Chemical Fibre MillIn May 2015, the North Korean leader flew into a rage during a visit to the Taedonggang Terrapin Farm, which had been built on the orders of his father, after discovering a number of dead baby terrapins in the tanks.He was further incensed when managers admitted they had not been able to breed lobsters ahead of a national holiday marking the founding of the Workers’ Party of Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspects some textiles while visiting the Sinuiju Textile MillKCNA reported that Mr Kim accused officials of “incompetence, an outmoded way of thinking and an irresponsible work style”.Despite the manager’s explanation that the terrapins had died due to electricity shortages, Mr Kim insisted the failings were down to bad management and had the man summarily shot. Please review our commenting policyJacob Rees-Mogg: Theresa May must keep her Brexit customs union promise or risk revolt by Tory MPsArtificial human ovaries created for first time in major breakthrough for infertile womenLeading piano competitions ban teachers from jury over rigging fearsAngela Merkel in showdown over migration deal as interior minister Seehofer announces he will resignJapan\u0026#39s yakuza gangs face crackdown as they cash in on .... sea cucumbersThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendComment: Why ban skirts when schools could simply make every uniform option available to all?Mexico\u0026#39s leftist Lopez Obrador wins largest landslide in country\u0026#39s historyNorth Korea expands weapons facilities despite US pressure to disarmIstanbul gay pride march hit with tear gas as Turkish police try to enforce banCheryl Tweedy and Liam Payne announce split, saying baby Bear \u0026#39is our world\u0026#39Prince Charles lends favourite family portraits for birthday exhibitionCouples paying £60,000 for surrogates despite UK system of \u0026#39reasonable expenses\u0026#39 onlyNHS pays moonlighting medics five times as much as Theresa May to plug gaps Poldark, series 4 episode 4, review: heartbreak and intrigue sees Poldark return to form14-year-old boy stabbed on busy London street in broad daylightRural families have a lower chance of getting on the property ladder than those living in citiesThe Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan, review: a refreshingly different travelogue with a potty-mouthed Michael PalinWinston Churchill was \u0026#39probably sexually abused\u0026#39 as a boy, House of Cards creator claimsMexico goes to the polls as candidates pray for peace - and victoryWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/02/TELEMMGLPICT000168157642_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqnQSfWb85vljghMlIYmeE7SZfogELpoVwvl2H5hr0nGk.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"mexicos leftistlopez obrador course election victory ruling","story":"digitalservices@telegraphAndres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the new president of Mexico, addressing supporters in Mexico City on Sunday nightdigitalservices@telegraphMexico’s veteran leftist leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has won the largest landslide in his country\u0027s history, capturing 53 per cent of the vote, according to preliminary results.In a historic victory which sent his supporters into a frenzy, flooding into Mexico City\u0027s main square, the Zocalo, Mr Lopez Obrador soundly defeated his rivals from the two parties which have ruled Mexico since independence.Donald Trump was quick congratulate him, saying: I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!Nicolas Maduro, the president of Venezuela - a country which Mr Lopez Obrador’s critics said would be his model - also sent his congratulations to “our brothers in Mexico.”“May the wide avenues of sovereignty and friendship between our people be opened,” he said. “With him, truth triumphs over lies, and hope in the great motherland is restored.”The result of the election means that Mr Lopez Obrador has the resounding support of the Mexican people to implement his programme of reform.I will not let you down, the 64-year-old promised, speaking at a hotel in Mexico City.He vowed to maintain economic stability, respecting the independence of the central bank, and ending corruption.And he repeated his campaign pledges to support the poorest sectors of society, saying: I am convinced that the most efficient and humane way of advancing is through tackling inequality and poverty. Jose Antonio Meade, candidate for the ruling PRI, announced shortly after the first exit polls were given, at 8pm in Mexico City, that he accepted his loss.He congratulated Mr Lopez Obrador, who according to Televisa\u0027s exit

effort to win over the sceptical northern states. Making his third attempt at taking the presidency, he promised to defeat “the mafia of power” and usher in a new era of corruption-free rule, in which

pensions for retirees, increasing scholarships for students, and boosting production and employment in the impoverished south.How he will pay for this remains unclear – his team speak vaguely of corruption reductions freeing up millions of dollars.Ricardo Anaya, presidential candidate for the National Action Party (PAN), displays an ink-stained thumb after casting his vote at a polling station in QueretaroAnd he has been remarkably unspecific in his plan for dealing with President Donald Trump, Nafta and the surging violence – only talking about rooting out the causes of organised crime, such as poverty and a lack of opportunities among the young, and floating a plan for an amnesty for cartel members.Nevertheless, his message has resonated in a country exhausted by endless corruption scandals and a failure to reduce the incessant violence.Please review our commenting policyArtificial human ovaries created for first time in major breakthrough for infertile womenLeading

the Brexit vote, officials are engaged in fractious debate on the terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union.They are wrestling with several thorny problems, including the fate of the customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.But the political and media focus on the deal to be struck has obscured the real message of British voters. The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

Just two companies –\u0026nbspBP and Shell –\u0026nbspaccounted for £1 in every £7 of all UK listed companies’ net debts.Both were forced to restructure after oil prices collapsed in 2015, taking on more debt, in part to maintain idend payments despite low profits.The consumer goods sector borrows more than any other in the UK, accounting for almost a quarter of UK plc\u0026nbspnet debts with three-quarters of that debt accounted for by just two companies: tobacco giants Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco.“It seems we may now have seen peak indebtedness,” said Justin Cooper,\u0026nbspchief executive of Link. However, investors should not be worried that listed companies are in trouble, he said.There was cause for concern two years ago as gearing levels –\u0026nbspthe ratio of a company’s debt to its equity capital –\u0026nbspapproached those seen just before the credit crunch. At the time companies’ profits were relatively low.“Now, healthy global growth means higher profits,” Cooper said. “That has both brought gearing levels down, and means that interest costs and idends are much more comfortably covered by profits. What’s more, companies are less dependent on short-term borrowings than at any time in the last 10\u0026nbspyears.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The research also surveyed almost 700 school leaders, looked at 10 years of Ofsted results and analysed how well Multi-Academy-Trusts worked.\u0026nbspReport authors Professor Toby Greany and Dr Rob Higham found the system had become less equitable, with higher achieving schools accepting fewer pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds than before.The report states: “The schools judged Good and Outstanding between 2010 and 2015 saw a relative reduction in the percentage of students eligible for free school meals (FSMs) compared to the 2005–10 period, while schools judged Satisfactory, Requires Improvement and Inadequate saw a relative increase. Schools that retained an Outstanding grade between 2010 and 2015 saw a greater relative reduction in FSM pupils compared to schools that were Outstanding in 2010 but that had been downgraded by 2015.”UK news in picturesA firefighter carries a water hose past sheep close to scorched moorland as it burns during a moorland fire at Winter Hill, near Rivington,People march in central London to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS.People look at the damage to the outside of a high-rise block in Wellington Way, Mile End, in east London, after a fire broke-out in a 12th floor flat.Prime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Usually after brushing his teeth. Or when stopping by the bathroom, or anywhere with a mirror.He hooks an index finger into each side of his mouth and pulls gently upward. He puckers his face into a kiss, then opens wide into an O, trying to limber up his facial muscles. He practises both the Mona Lisa – slight, closed-lip – and a wide, toothy smile.At least, he’s supposed to do his exercises every day. Being 13, he sometimes forgets, though he understands their importance.“I need to stretch my cheeks,” he says. “I do it for a couple minutes. I have to do it every single day.” He exercises so much that his jaw sometimes hurts. \u0026nbspDavid and Victoria Beckham smile in \u0027amazing\u0027 family night picture How to get white teeth: Four top tips to achieve a brighter smileMan smiles before lethal injection for murder of two young daughtersKevin was born in New Jersey with a rare malignant vascular tumour, a kaposiform haemangioendothelioma, covering the left side of his face, squeezing shut his left eye and pushing his nose to the right. Immediately after his birth, doctors whisked him away to another hospital in another state – the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. His mother didn’t see him again until he was eight days old.The doctor told Kevin’s parents that the chance of him surviving was slim.\u0026nbspBut survive he did. However, the large tumour and the damage from its treatment prevented him from being able to do one of the most fundamental things humans do.\u0026nbspSmile.Most babies are born immediately able to communicate with the world around them in one way: by crying.The second signal babies send out is a smile. Newborns can smile spontaneously, as a reflex. This is sometimes misinterpreted by new parents as a reaction to their presence, a reward for their intense concern and sleepless efforts. However, it’s not until six to eight weeks of age that babies smile in a social way. Blind babies do this at the same time.That new parents sometimes optimistically interpret the first reflex smiles as meaning something more underscores the duality of smiling: there is the physical act, and then the interpretation society gives to it.\u0026nbspThe smile, and what the smile means.On a physical level, a smile is clear enough. There are 17 pairs of muscles controlling expression in the human face, plus a singular muscle, the orbicularis oris, a ring that goes entirely around the mouth.When the brain either reacts to a stimulus spontaneously or decides to form an expression intentionally, a message is sent out over the sixth and seventh cranial nerves. These branch across each side of the face from the eyebrows to the chin, connecting to a combination of muscles controlling the lips, nose, eyes and forehead.The basic upward curving smile is achieved primarily by two pairs of zygomaticus muscles, major and minor. These connect the corners of the mouth to the temples, tugging lips upward – often accompanied, depending on the underlying emotions and thoughts, by the levator labii superioris, raising the upper lip, and other muscles of the face.And as for the oft-cited folk wisdom about how it takes more muscles to frown than smile – the jury’s still out, especially as different smiles require different numbers of muscles. However, one source suggests that a genuine smile takes about as many muscles as a frown (and that a particularly insincere kind of smile might take not much more than the pair of risorius muscles).It is when we leave the realm of physiognomy, however, that the smile becomes enigmatic. This contraction of various facial muscles resonates across the entire arc of human history, from the grinning Greek kouros sculptures of 2,500 years ago right up to emoji, those little images that pepper our online communications.One study of smartphone users from 60 countries showed that emoji with smiling faces are by far the most prevalent in messages. The most popular overall – the face with tears of joy – was picked as the 2015 Word of the Year by Oxford Dictionaries. \u0026nbspJust as this emoji expresses more than mere happiness – tears adding the ironic twist so popular online – smiles themselves can convey so much more than happiness. Interpreting their nuances is a challenge whether dealing with art history or interpersonal encounters or the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.A 2016 study, published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour, questioned thousands of people in 44 cultures about sets of photographs of eight faces – four smiling, four not.In most of these cultures, people deemed the smiling faces to be more honest than the non-smiling ones. This difference was huge in some countries, such as Switzerland, Australia and the Philippines, but small in others, such as Pakistan, Russia and France. And in a few countries, such as Iran, India and Zimbabwe, there was no trustworthiness benefit to smiling at all.Why? That question is also complicated, but in essence, the researchers concluded it has to do with whether a society is set up so that its members assume that other people are dealing with them honestly. “Greater corruption levels decreased trust granted towards smiling iniduals,” the authors concluded.That attitude harks back to a very old view of smiling as being opposed to pious solemnity. There is exactly one smile in the Old Testament – Job, ironically – though in many passages faces are said to “shine”, which could mean smiling or could mean heavenly radiance.Eastern religions often use the smile to denote enlightenment. The literal name of the 1000-year-old Flower Sermon, which describes the origin of Zen Buddhism, is: “Pick up flower, subtle smile.”\u0026nbspThe Buddha and various religious figures were depicted with serene smiles, though the original Buddhist texts are as devoid of smiling as Western scripture. Jesus weeps but never smiles.Nor did Kevin Portillo, not fully. He did not smile on schedule. At five weeks old, he was already a week into chemotherapy with vincristine, an anticancer drug so powerful it can cause bone pain and skin rashes. Doctors warned his mother that the treatment might leave him blind, or deaf, or unable to walk.“If he survived,” says his mother, Silvia Portillo, in Spanish, speaking through a translator. “The doctor always said he could not give us hope that he would survive.”Whether stunted due to the tumour or killed by the chemo, Kevin’s seventh cranial nerve withered. That nerve originates at the brainstem then branches out across the face. It is susceptible not only to tumours, as in Kevin’s case, but also to rare conditions such as Moebius syndrome, a congenital facial paralysis caused by missing or stunted cranial nerves. You can’t smile, frown, or move your eyes from side to side.“You essentially have a mask on your face,” says Roland Bienvenu, 67, a Texan with Moebius syndrome.Without being able to smile, others “can get the incorrect impression of you,” says Bienvenu. “You can almost read their thoughts. They wonder, ‘Is something wrong with him? Has he had an accident?’ They question your intellectual ability, think maybe he’s got some intellectual disability since he’s got this blank look on his face.”A lopsided smile can be as problematic as no smile at all.“I have half a smile, so even with that I am able to successfully convey emotion,” writes Dawn Shawn, born with a teratoma – a fast-growing tumour that was interfering with her windpipe.“The hardest part for me was seeing photos of myself smiling, because smiling exaggerates the fact that half my face doesn’t move very much. But eventually I learned to own it. That is me. That is how I look.”The challenges stemming from lack of a smile are frequently compounded. When people have a medical condition severe enough to keep them from smiling, other difficulties tend to be involved.“He was different than the other kids,” says Silvia of her son. “He was fed for four years through the G-tube in his stomach. He wasn’t able to have a normal life, because every few hours he had to be connected to the machine to be fed.” Little kids, being curious, would look and ask what happened to him, she says.While those who cannot smile can blame the state of their facial nerves and muscles, those who can smile are often concerned with a different aspect of physiognomy: their teeth. More than $3bn is spent worldwide on teeth-whitening products, with billions more spent on braces and on purely cosmetic dentistry: straightening crooked teeth, for instance, or reducing the amount of gum that shows when a person smiles.Caring for the state of your teeth is not a modern concern. The Romans had dentists and used chewing sticks and toothpaste. They preferred dazzling white smiles, sometimes rinsing their teeth in urine to enhance the effect.Contrary to common modern perceptions, the ancients had surprisingly good teeth, for reasons that have nothing to do with dentistry. A CAT scan of 30 adult bodies recovered at Pompeii found they had “perfect teeth”.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.650 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.750 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.850 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 950 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1050 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1250 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.1350 Fertility \u0027breakthrough\u0027 as human eggs grown in lab for first timeHuman eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments. 1450 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.1550 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1650 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded1750 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively1850 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested.

Prior to the French Revolution, broad smiles in art were overwhelmingly the realm of the lewd, the drunk and the boisterous lower classes.“The whole face ought to reflect an air of seriousness and wisdom,” John Baptist de La Salle wrote in his 1703 The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility, allowing that people might, under certain circumstances, convey the impression that they are happy, provided it is done within limits.“There are some people who raise their upper lip so high or let the lower lip sag so much that their teeth are almost entirely visible. This is entirely contrary to decorum, which forbids you to allow your teeth to be uncovered, for nature gave us lips to conceal them…”In The Smile Revolution in Eighteenth Century Paris, Colin Jones argues that smiling reflected the gathering sense of inidual worth that went along with the beheading of kings:This shift in social practices and in sensibilities involved the emergence of the perception, common in our own day, that the smile offered a key to inidual identity. In late eighteenth-century Paris, the smile came to be viewed as symbol of an inidual’s innermost and most authentic self. In a way that was perceived as both novel and modern, it was held to reveal the character of the person within.Photography, by capturing smiles, eventually helped popularise them. But the sitters in 19th-century photographs still rarely smiled, a neutral continence being both easier to hold over the long exposure necessary at the time and less likely to detract from the gravity of the occasion.“A photograph is a most important document, and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity than a silly, foolish smile caught and fixed forever,” humorist Mark Twain was quoted as remarking in the 1913 memoir of an acquaintance.Around the same time, however, Kodak in the US launched extensive advertising campaigns to help consumers see photography as a means of recording joyous events and celebrations.Over the century, smiles showed a confidence in keeping with the rise of modern capitalism. “An insincere grin? That doesn’t fool anybody,” Dale Carnegie wrote in his 1936 bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People, embraced as a life guide by millions.“We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.”Part of the attractiveness of smiles is they are so easily extended. Part of their menace is that they can also be just as easily withheld.“For a salesman, there’s no rock bottom to the life,” Charlie says at the end of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. “He don’t put a bolt to a nut, he don’t tell you the law or give you medicine. He’s a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smiling back – that’s an earthquake.”Once Kevin was able to eat food, go to school and enjoy usual childhood pastimes – he became passionate about soccer and playing the drums – he still felt the tremors of having a half-smile in a world solidly established upon “a cultural expectation of pearly perfection”, as Richard Barnett writes in his book The Smile Stealers.“I couldn’t smile on my left, I only smiled on my right,” says Kevin. “My smile was weird … people kept asking what happened to me, why I\u0027m like this. I keep telling them I was like this when I was born.”If you see someone in a wheelchair, you anticipate that the person might have trouble walking and assume a physical condition is involved. But facial paralysis carries no telltale equipment, and is rare enough that the unaffected population is not generally familiar with the conditions that cause it, whether congenital or appearing later in life.One of the latter is Bell’s palsy, an inflammation of the sheathing around the facial nerves on one side that paralyses half the face, causing the eye and corner of the mouth to droop. It usually strikes men and women between the ages of 15 and 60.In most cases temporary, Bell’s palsy generally slowly goes away as mysteriously as it arrives. Doctors suspect it is caused by a viral infection. There are also traumatic events – car wrecks, sporting accidents – that damage nerves and muscles in the face, plus congenital irregularities such as cleft palate.A common condition that can also affect the smile is stroke. A sagging smile or face drooped on one side is one of three signs that a person has had a stroke and needs immediate emergency care (the other two are weakness or numbness in one arm, and slurred or garbled speech).While losing a smile is a serious blow at any age, it can have a particular impact on younger people, who are starting out, forming the bonds that will carry them through the rest of their lives.\u0026nbspOr trying to.“It’s a huge problem,” says Tami Konieczny, supervisor of occupational therapy at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHoP). “When you look at somebody, the first thing you see is their face, their ability to smile or not smile, or an asymmetrical smile. It’s your social world.“If someone can’t read your facial expressions, then it’s difficult to be socially accepted. It’s hugely devastating for kids. I had kids photoshopping their pictures. They are taking mirror images of their good side and copying it, photoshopping their own pictures before posting them to social media.”Photoshopping might work on Facebook. But fixing a smile bisected by nerve damage and subsequent muscle loss – Kevin couldn’t move the muscles on the left side of his face, so they atrophied – is far more complicated. Sometimes, it requires multi-stage plastic surgery spread out over a year or more.There are two major procedures available for facial reanimation, according to Phuong Nguyen, a plastic surgeon and reconstructive surgeon at CHoP.The newest, which has its roots in older techniques, is called a lengthening temporalis myoplasty – taking part of the broad band of muscle that powers the jaws and repurposing it to draw up the lips.That wasn’t ideal for Kevin because he had one side of his face working. The older, more complicated surgery was better suited to him.“Kevin had the most commonly done one, a classic two-stage cross-face nerve graft followed by a free gracilis muscle transfer,” says Nguyen. “To be perfectly honest, when Kevin had his stage, we weren’t familiar with the lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedure yet.”Nguyen later learned the new procedure from facial reanimation pioneer Ronald Zuker, a Canadian plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and from its originator, French surgeon Daniel Labbé.“My preference is to do it when kids are five years of age,” says Zuker. “At the time, if I can restore a smile for them, they can go to primary school, meet kids on the playground, meet kids in class. They have their smiles and are well-equipped to handle that situation.”Why put children through what is still elective surgery?“It’s incredibly important to be able to interact with humans on a face-to-face basis,” says Zuker. “If you don’t have the ability to smile, you are at a disadvantage. People cannot understand your inner emotions. They mistake your appearance for being disinterested, or not too bright, or not very involved in the conversation.”Still, some parents prefer to wait until their children are older and can participate in the decision.“If families want to wait, that’s perfectly fine,” says Zuker. “Sometimes when a kid is nine or 10 they look in the mirror and say, ‘You know, I really want this surgery.’ That’s the time to do it.”Which is what happened with Kevin. He was doing well, “even with that scar on his face, has always been popular at school,” says his mother. “He’s always been a happy kid.”But there were kids that made fun of him, she says. One day when he was about nine, he was sad. “I said, ‘What happened to you?’ He said, ‘Some kids, they’re not my friends. They laugh at me because I look funny.’ It was really hard for us as parents.”“We always wanted the surgery,” she says. “But we were told it was impossible. We had to wait to see how everything was changing.”At age 10, Kevin told his parents that he wanted to do what most people do without giving it a second thought. He knew it would be a long, painful, difficult procedure, but it was one he wanted to undergo.“He’s very engaging, very motivated,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his occupational therapist at CHoP. “His goal, I wrote in my notes, was to have a symmetrical smile.”As with smiles themselves, so the scientific study of smiles reflects the cleavage between the physical and the interpretive. The physical side is entwined with the long history of plastic surgery, which has tended to focus on survivors of diseases like syphilis and of the knives of vengeful authorities and warlords.The father of modern plastic surgery, Harold Gillies, reported in 1934 that restoring the ability to smile made patients’ faces “feel much more comfortable”. In addition, Gillies observed, “the psychological effect is also one of considerable value”.On the interpretive side, Charles Darwin discusses the meaning and value of smiles in his 1872 landmark The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Like many, Darwin sees a smile as the first part of a continuum.“A smile, therefore, may be said to be the first stage in the development of a laugh,” \u0026nbsphe writes, then reverses course, musing that perhaps the smile is instead the remnant of laughter.He observes his own infants closely, detecting in two their first smiles at six weeks, and earlier in the third. He comments how smiles do more than merely convey happiness, mentioning the “derisive or sardonic smile” and the “unnatural or false smile”, and showing photos to see if his associates can read what they mean.The scientific study of smiles finds differences in gender (generally, women smile more) and culture. Smiles are definitely communicative – people smile more when in public than they do when alone, and more when interacting with others than when not.Scientists have shown that smiles are far easier to recognise than other expressions. What they don’t know is why.“We can do really well recognising smiles,” says Aleix Martinez, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University and founder of its Computational Biology and Cognitive Science Lab.“Why is that true? Nobody can answer that right now. We don’t know. We really do not know. We have a classical experiment, where we showed images of facial expressions to people, but we showed them very rapidly… 10 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds.“People can detect a smile even in exposures smaller than 10 milliseconds. I can show you an image for just 10 milliseconds and you can tell me it’s a smile. It does not work with any other expression.”Fear takes an exposure time of 250 milliseconds to recognise – 25 times as long as a smile, “which makes absolutely no sense, evolutionarily speaking,” Martinez says. “Recognising fear is fundamental to survival, while a smile… But that’s how we are wired.”Studies have shown that smiling faces are judged as more familiar than neutral ones. And it’s not just us that can recognise smiles more easily. “This is true both for humans and for machines,” says Martinez. Alibaba, China’s answer to Amazon, launched its new facial recognition payment system called “Smile to Pay” in September 2017.Although scientists have been studying smiles for about 150 years, they are still at the stage of trying to count and categorise types of smile among the millions of possible facial expressions.“One of the fundamental questions in the scientific literature right now is how many facial expressions do we actually produce?” says Martinez. “Nobody knows.”Scientists such as Martinez theorise that smiles – as well as frowns and other facial expressions – are remnants of humanity’s distant pre-linguistic heritage. Human language started developing as far back as 100,000 years ago, but our expressions reach back further still, even to before our origins as human beings.“Before we could communicate verbally, we had to communicate with our faces,” Martinez says. “Which brings us to a very interesting, very fundamental question in science: where does language come from? Language is not fossilised, not found in any other living species. How could something that complex have evolved from nothingness?”One of the hypotheses is that it evolved through facial expression of emotion, he says. “First we learned to move our facial muscles – ‘I’m happy. I feel positive with you! I’m angry. I feel disgust.’ Then language came through a grammaticalisation of facial expressions, which over time evolved into what we call grammar and language.”In October 2015, Nguyen, who plays in a band, cranked up some rock music in the operating room at CHoP – he thinks it was probably something from the Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream.He began work by removing a section of sural nerve from Kevin’s right ankle and attaching it to the working right side of his face, running it underneath his upper lip, to the paralysed left.“We bring it across, parking it, waiting for nerves to regrow from the right side to the left,” Nguyen says.That growth took almost a year. The nerve fibres advanced about a millimetre a day (about 24,000 times slower than a snail).In nerve grafts like this, many of the fibres don’t make it across. This means that the nerve can lose the ability to transmit information – in a few cases, completely.“The thing with nerve-based surgery, you don’t get a lot of instant gratification or feedback,” says Nguyen. “You do the procedure and don’t know if it works or not. You have to wait.”During that time, doctors would periodically tap areas of Kevin’s cheek, to see if the nerve was taking. “When it tingles, you know the nerve is growing,” says Nguyen.The body has a way of covering losses. Removing that nerve did cause a small patch of skin on Kevin’s ankle to go numb. But as he was still growing, the numb patch began to shrink as the neural network took over its function.Once Nguyen was certain the nerve was in place and functioning, it was time for the second stage of the surgery.The mystery of Mona Lisa\u0027s smile has finally been solved Mona Lisa smile \u0027based on his gay lover\u0027, art historian claimsRussian Mona Lisa could be genuineSecrets of the Mona Lisa, BBC2, TV review: the face behind the paintOne morning in August 2016, he took a purple marker and wrote a “P” on Kevin’s left temple and an “NP” on his right, for “paralysed” and “not paralysed”, a common surgical precaution against the risk of cutting into the wrong side of a patient – easier than you might imagine, considering how much of a patient’s body is draped before surgery.“It happens,” says Nguyen. “You want to make it idiot-proof.” \u0026nbspHe also drew a pair of parallel lines, marking the location of a prime artery, and an arrow: the vector Kevin’s smile would take.The surgeon made an incision from the temporal hair line, in front of Kevin’s left ear, then pivoting back under and behind it, extending into his neck – the standard location for hiding plastic surgery scars. The skin on a face peels back easily. He attached three sutures to the inside corner of Kevin’s mouth and gently pulled, to gauge exactly where the muscle should be attached.“So you know it’s in the right place,” explains Nguyen. “If you don’t get this right, they’re going to have to live with it for the rest of their life.”The moment Nguyen put strain on the triple surgical thread was the first time Kevin Portillo ever smiled on the left side of his face.That done, Nguyen removed a 12-centimetre segment of gracilis muscle, along with a section of artery and vein, from the inside of Kevin’s left thigh, as well as the obturator nerve. The muscle was secured in place by a customised splint that hooked into Kevin’s mouth and was sewn to the side of his head to keep the relocated muscle from pulling out before it healed.The section was taken from Kevin’s thigh because the powerful upper leg is rich in muscles. “There are so many muscles that do the same function… you don’t miss this,” Nguyen says.Well… most wouldn’t miss it. Kevin, a diehard young soccer fan, did. “When the surgery came I couldn’t play,” he says. “I didn’t know it would take that long. I thought it would take a couple days and I would be back.”Just how long was he sidelined?“It was more than two weeks,” he says, sorrowfully.“He wasn’t concerned with how serious the surgery was,” his mother says, laughing. “He was more concerned with not being able to play soccer.”Over the next year, Kevin began to get motion on the left side of his mouth.“It’s really kind of a magical thing,” says Nguyen. “We do this procedure, a number of hours and effort, using not a small amount of resources. We don’t know if it works or not.“I saw him post-operatively within the first couple of weeks, he looked like he had this big bulgy thing in his cheek. Nothing was moving. All of a sudden, he was smiling. It was a really incredible moment.”Well, it’s magical, but it’s also hard work. Low-tech and high-tech.\u0026nbspKevin begins his regular occupational therapy session by holding a two-cent white plastic fork in his mouth and showing that he can move it up and down.“Try to purse your lips together to make it stand up,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his therapist at CHoP. “We’ve got it pretty solid in the middle. Try to work it over to the weaker side. Nice try… and that’s harder.”Kevin puts on purple latex gloves and pulls at the inside of his cheek.“You’re going to do your stretch on the inside,” says Field. “A nice, slow hold. Good. Bring that thumb up… Do you feel like it’s getting looser than it was?”“Mmm-hmmm,” Kevin agrees, gloved fingers in mouth.She takes some photos. There is a lot of photography in facial therapy, to track progress.“Now give me the biggest open-mouthed smile you can,” says Field. “Good. Can you make the left side go up even more? Try to make your gums even.”Then, after more exercises, she asks if he is ready for the computer work.They move into the next room, to a $20,000 Lenovo biometric therapy system. Field sticks a surface EMG – an oblong black sensor that reads electrical activity in the muscle – to Kevin’s left cheek and he plays a video game, Load Ship, where he moves animated boxes from a conveyor on the screen by smiling and relaxing.“Give me a big smile,” Field says, calibrating the device. “And relax.”He plays for four minutes, the game burbling a skittery kind of jazzy electronic music.They play a few other games: one trying to get a man to a safe spot as two serrated blue spaces come together. Then a marble maze.“How are you feeling?” she asks.“Hurts,” he replies.Physical rehabilitation is the part of the surgical process that often gets overlooked, but it can make the difference between success and failure.“It’s huge, particularly with facial palsy,” says Nguyen. “You can do technically very sound surgery on two completely different patients and have two completely different outcomes based on how involved they are with their own therapy… It just doesn’t look as good.”How does Kevin feel about being able to fully smile after a lifetime of not being able to?“I’ve been getting better on how I react. I do it automatically,” says Kevin. “Sometimes when somebody says a joke. It actually feels great now. Before it felt weird to not smile. Smiling with both sides of my mouth at same time, I feel I’m one of the other people who smiles right.”His mother remembers the moment she noticed.“We were at the table, we were eating,” says Silvia. “And then we said, ‘Kevin, are you moving there?’ He started moving. Not the way he was doing today little movements.”“We were eating,” he says. “I think she said something funny, and I just smiled.”And how does smiling affect his life?“Before, I was actually shy,” he says. “Right now, I’m less shy, more active.”“I used to have trouble expressing my emotions. Now people know if I’m smiling or laughing. When I laughed, before, I laughed weird. And right now, they know, bit by bit, that I was trying to smile, I was expressing my laughter and my smile. When I play soccer, and score a goal, I’m happy. I’m smiling, to tell everybody I scored.”You’d be forgiven for thinking that classifying and counting the different types of smile would be straightforward. It’s anything but.In the mid 19th century, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne wanted to distinguish real smiles from fake. Interested in the response of nerves and muscles to stimulation, he applied electricity to particular parts of faces to see the results.He ided smiles into two groups: those that involved the crinkling of the eyes – sincere smiles – and those that used only the muscles around the mouth – insincere smiles.Today, the full smile that uses the muscles around the mouth and eyes is known as a “Duchenne smile” – and the fake one is the “Pan Am smile”, after the kind of smile you might greet someone with if it’s part of your job to be friendly.In 1974, Leonard Rubin described three basic types of smile, based on his study of 100 people:The “Mona Lisa”, where the corners of the mouth go up and outwards and the upper teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the zygomaticus major. About two-thirds of people studied smile this wayThe “canine” smile, where the canine teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the levator labii superioris. 31 per cent of people smiled like thisThe “full dentured”, where the lips are pulled back strongly, showing both upper and lower rows of teeth. All muscles are equally dominant. Just 2 per cent of people were found to smile this wayCosmetic surgeons, who have to be meticulous in identifying the smiles that their patients are paying good money to try to achieve, call these three types commissure, cuspid and complex, respectively.Phuong Nguyen, a Philadelphia plastic and reconstructive surgeon, attempts to clarify the matter using celebrities. The Mona Lisa, he says, is the Angelina Jolie. The Tom Cruise smile is a canine smile, and a Julia Roberts is the full dentured smile. This is a subjective matter. Other doctors place Jolie in the second or third categories.Smiling is not a realm given over to easy description. Contemplate the ideal smile as recounted by one clinician in the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics:An optimal smile is characterised by an upper lip that reaches the gingival margins, with an upward or straight curvature between the philtrum and commissures an upper incisal line coincident with the border of the lower lip minimal or no lateral negative space a commissural line and occlusal frontal plane parallel to the pupillary line and harmoniously integrated dental and gingival components.The total number of different types of smile is frequently debated. A recent BBC article gave the total as 19.Arguably the most important researcher into smiles over the past 30 years has been Paul Ekman at the University of California. His 1978 Facial Action Coding System, written with Wallace V Friesen, seeks to create an atlas of nearly all possible human expressions. Ekman says, in his book Telling Lies, that their technique for measuring the face can distinguish over 50 different smiles.Confused? You’re not the only one.

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously.

Renters stay in a home for an average of four years but eight in 10 contracts are for a minimum of six or 12 months.Under the proposals, tenants would be able to leave before three years but would have greater protection if they wanted to stay put.UK news in picturesA firefighter carries a water hose past sheep close to scorched moorland as it burns during a moorland fire at Winter Hill, near Rivington,People march in central London to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS.People look at the damage to the outside of a high-rise block in Wellington Way, Mile End, in east London, after a fire broke-out in a 12th floor flat.Prime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

In London, private renting is now the most common form of tenure.The government has pushed through a raft of policies that have fuelled instability for renters since it came to office, most notably depriving people of the right to live in their council home for life.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, there are 1.15 million households on waiting lists for social housing and the issue is becoming ever more acute as councils do not replace housing stock sold under the right to buy.The passage of the Housing and Planning Bill, in 2016, coincided with the news that 72 of the Conservative MPs who voted to reject a proposed rule that would have required private landlords to make their homes “fit for human habitation” were themselves landlords.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The franchise would then be run by a state-controlled “operator of last resort” company staffed by civil servants.An estimated 230,000 passengers use Thameslink and Great Northern – which run from Bedford through London to Brighton, and Peterborough to Kings Cross station in London – every working day.The implementation of a new timetable had been expected to cause delays but chaos soon ensued, with cancelled trains\u0026nbspand long delays at train stations becoming routine.\u0027Extreme\u0027 heat to climb higher amid wildfires and rail disruptionRail bosses apologise to MPs over new train timetable shamblesGTR’s response further angered customers. Additional security staff were posted at stations on GTR routes to protect staff from unhappy commuters, while the rail operator appeared to blame a sole taxi company for disruption across four separate routes.Charles Horton, GTR chief executive, resigned in recognition of the company’s “very challenging times” and Mr Grayling has faced calls to step down, as MPs from across the House of Commons expressed their concern at the prolonged inability of their constituents to arrive at work on time.A spokesman for Govia Thameslink reportedly refused to comment on the reports about the possible loss of the franchises and instead chose to re-release a statement that apologised for the disruption.UK news in picturesA firefighter carries a water hose past sheep close to scorched moorland as it burns during a moorland fire at Winter Hill, near Rivington,People march in central London to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS.People look at the damage to the outside of a high-rise block in Wellington Way, Mile End, in east London, after a fire broke-out in a 12th floor flat.Prime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

We don’t know exactly what she is asking for yet, so how can there be?“First the UK needs to decide what it wants, then there needs to be a discussion here and even if it is acceptable, there are processes that have to take place first before everyone agrees to move forward.”Another source close to the European Commission told The Independent: “Now we are looking at December as a more likely option, but there are questions about how much time that leaves for the deal to be ratified in time before March.”There is no hope really for October now. We don’t know exactly what she is asking for yet, so how can there be?In broadcast interviews senior figures also pressed the need for urgency, with commission president Jean-Claude Juncker calling for UK negotiators to finally “make clear their positions”, and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte saying: “I am not losing patience, but time is getting shorter and shorter to come to an agreement.”On the record Downing Street is still clear that the UK’s intention is to secure a deal as quickly as possible, with October’s summit the goal.Varadkar criticises government for not planning for Brexit before EU referendumA No 10 spokesman said when last week’s get-together concluded: “We have always been clear the Brexit is a challenging process.“But we have made good progress so far, and are publishing a white paper next month setting out clearly what our future plans will achieve.”The food and drink staples at risk of shortages due to BrexitDanny Dyer’s rant about Brexit and David Cameron in fullWhy is Jeremy Corbyn staying quiet on Brexit?What do the ‘bad boys’ of Brexit have to do with Russia and Trump? Danny Dyer’s expletive-laden tirade on David Cameron and BrexitHowever, the view taken off the record by British ministers more closely corroborates the idea that the timetable has now slipped, with senior frontbenchers signalling that October has been becoming less plausible the longer the deadlock in London continues.December is also now being seen as the moment when a deal could most plausibly be struck, something supported by the fact that the government identified 21 January 2019 as a potential staging post on the road to Brexit.A proposed amendment to Ms May’s EU withdrawal bill, which has now received royal assent, committed a minister to making a statement to parliament if that date passes without a deal.But if December is now the new deadline, it leaves the prime minister facing a race against time in the new year\u0026nbspto win parliamentary backing for any agreement before Brexit takes place on 29 March 2019.She will need to win a one-off vote backing the deal and enshrine it in a piece of legislation, which both houses of parliament may wish to amend.People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchRecent fraught debates and rebellions as Ms May tried to pass her EU withdrawal act have not gone unnoticed in Brussels, where officials are nervous that the prime minister may yet fail to have the deal they agree backed by enough MPs.But first the prime minister must secure the backing of Brexiteers in her cabinet, in a crunch meeting at her official country residence that should finish with the UK being able to publish its latest Brexit white paper, setting its goals for future relations with the EU.One potential source of friction, post-Brexit immigration rules, has been neutered for now, with government sources telling The Independent that element of Ms May’s future plans is more likely to be explored in a separate paper coming closer to September – but the vexed issue of customs arrangements still needs to be agreed by her top team.The Chequers meeting was originally set up to start the previous day, with only those who sit on the cabinet’s Brexit subcommittee attending.But with that group having already failed to agree to either of Ms May’s options for customs and leaning towards a harder Brexit since the departure of the more Remain-minded ex-home secretary Amber Rudd, the Thursday meeting was scrapped.Holding a meeting of the whole cabinet could give Ms May more cover to pursue a path which would see her keep the UK in a tighter customs deal with the EU and even the single market for good.\u0026nbspBut there has been some speculation that if she goes too far, then key Brexiteers – most notably Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox – could seize the moment and resign from her cabinet, badly destabilising her whole administration.Those close to Mr Johnson, whose name comes up more than the others, have rubbished the idea. Either way, Downing Street insiders admit that Friday’s meeting could well be one that runs into the following day.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We must not remain entangled with the EU’s institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation.“Anything less will be a weakening of our democracy. Britain must stand firm.”In a sign that a longer transition period could be accepted across the political ide, those\u0026nbspcomments were earlier echoed by Jeremy Corbyn, who said he believed the transition period after Brexit would be extended.“At the moment it’s not set in stone,” he told Sophy Ridge on Sunday. “It’s talked around for two years.

Just two companies –\u0026nbspBP and Shell –\u0026nbspaccounted for £1 in every £7 of all UK listed companies’ net debts.Both were forced to restructure after oil prices collapsed in 2015, taking on more debt, in part to maintain idend payments despite low profits.The consumer goods sector borrows more than any other in the UK, accounting for almost a quarter of UK plc\u0026nbspnet debts with three-quarters of that debt accounted for by just two companies: tobacco giants Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco.“It seems we may now have seen peak indebtedness,” said Justin Cooper,\u0026nbspchief executive of Link. However, investors should not be worried that listed companies are in trouble, he said.There was cause for concern two years ago as gearing levels –\u0026nbspthe ratio of a company’s debt to its equity capital –\u0026nbspapproached those seen just before the credit crunch. At the time companies’ profits were relatively low.“Now, healthy global growth means higher profits,” Cooper said. “That has both brought gearing levels down, and means that interest costs and idends are much more comfortably covered by profits. What’s more, companies are less dependent on short-term borrowings than at any time in the last 10\u0026nbspyears.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They allegedly had information about Hillary Clinton and offered that information to the Trump campaign through a lawyer with whom they had worked with, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and music publicist Rob Goldstone. Natalia Veselnitskaya is a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. She has worked on real estate issues and reportedly counted the FSB as a client in the past. She has ties to a Trump family connection, real estate magnate Aras Agalarov, who had helped set up the Trump-owned 2013 Miss Universe pageant which took place in Moscow. Ms Veselnitskaya met with Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort in Trump Tower on 9 June 2016 but denies the allegation that she went there promising information on Hillary Clinton\u0027s alleged financial ties to Russia. She contends that the meeting was about the US adoptions of Russian children being stopped by Moscow as a reaction to the Magnitsky Act, a US law blacklisting Russian human rights abusers. Mr Flynn was named as Trump\u0027s national security adviser but was forced to resign from his post for inappropriate communication with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. He had misrepresented a conversation he had with Mr Kislyak to Vice President Mike Pence, telling him wrongly that he had not discussed sanctions with the Russian.Mr Kislyak, the former longtime Russian ambassador to the US, is at the centre of the web said to connect President Donald Trump\u0027s campaign with Russia. Mr Stone is a former Trump adviser who worked on the political campaigns of Richard Nixon, George HW Bush, and Ronald Reagan.The US attorney general was forced to recuse himself from the Trump-Russia investigation after it was learned that he had lied about meeting with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.Mr Page is a former advisor to the Trump campaign and has a background working as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch.Mr Gordon met with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 Republian National Convention to discuss how the US and Russia could work together to combat Islamist extremism should then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump win the election. The meeting came days before a massive leak of DNC emails that has been connected to Russia.Mr Comey was fired from his post as head of the FBI by President Donald Trump. The timing of Mr Comey\u0027s firing raised questions around whether or not the FBI\u0027s investigation into the Trump campaign may have played a role in the decision.Mr Bahara refused, alongside 46 other US district attorney\u0027s across the country, to resign once President Donald Trump took office after previous assurances from Mr Trump that he would keep his job.Ms Yates, a former Deputy Attorney General, was running the Justice Department while President Donald Trump\u0027s pick for attorney general awaited confirmation. Ms Yates was later fired by Mr Trump from her temporary post over her refusal to implement Mr Trump\u0027s first travel ban.The US initially sanctioned Russia over the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its support for a pro-Russian uprising in the east of the country. Subsequent sanctions have punished Moscow for what Washington has called its malign behaviour and alleged meddling in US politics.Special prosecutor Robert Mueller, leading the FBI investigation into the 2016 presidential election,\u0026nbsphas indicted Russian firms and iniduals for allegedly meddling\u0026nbspto the benefit of Mr Trump.\u0026nbspMr Mueller\u0027s team is also investigating whether anyone in Mr Trump’s campaign helped the Russian effort. The US president has repeatedly called\u0026nbspthe investigation a “witch hunt”. The Kremlin also denies being involved in any interference.Mr Bolton said he did not think there was “anything unusual” about Mr Trump meeting Mr Putin.skripals and Russian security“I think the fact of the summit itself is a deliverable,” Mr Bolton said after talks with Mr Putin and other Russian officials. “There are a lot of issues to talk about that have accumulated, and I think this was one of the reasons why President Trump believed so strongly that it was time to have this kind of meeting. And as you can see, President Putin agreed.”\u0026nbspRussia\u0027s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is likely to meet with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo within the next two weeks as part of efforts to set the stage for the summit.\u0026nbspMr Ryabkov said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies on Thursday that Moscow has already made a proposal regarding the specifics of the meeting and is waiting for Washington\u0027s answer.Nato\u0026nbspSecretary-General Jens Stoltenberg\u0026nbspwelcomed the meeting, saying that\u0026nbspNato\u0027s approach to Russia is one of defence and but also dialogue“It\u0027s absolutely, totally in line with Nato\u0026nbsppolicies to talk to Russia, to meet with Russian leaders. We don\u0027t want a new Cold War. We don\u0027t want to isolate Russia. We want to strive for a better relationship,” Mr\u0026nbspStoltenberg\u0026nbspsaid.For me, dialogue is not a sign of weakness.

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

But what does it mean to be socialist or democratic socialist – and is there even a difference?\u0026nbspMs Ocasio-Cortez is a registered member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and is a self-described socialist.\u0026nbspSocialist remains a dirty – and often misunderstood – term in the realm of US politics. The Cold War, in which animosity and paranoia toward the Soviet Union was widespread across the US, is largely to thank for that.\u0026nbspA socialist, in the traditional sense, is an adherent of socialism.\u0026nbsp\u0027Future of the Democrats\u0027: All you need to know about Ocasio-CortezReject austerity to defeat populism, Portugal\u0027s socialist PM tells EUSocialism can be defined as a system of social organization in which private property and the distribution of income are subject to social control.\u0026nbspIn other words, it\u0027s a state-controlled economy in which the state controls the means of production: factories, offices, resources, and firms. There are also forms of socialism in which the means of production are controlled and owned by workers.\u0026nbspFrom an academic standpoint, there\u0027s an ongoing debate about what socialism really is.The academic debates about socialism’s \u0027meaning\u0027 are huge and arcane and rife with disagreements, but what all definitions have in common is either the elimination of the market or its strict containment, Frances Fox Piven, a political scientist at the City University of New York and a former DSA board member, told Vox.In general, socialists believe the government should provide a range of basic services to the public, such as health care and education, for free or at a significant discount.In the present day, democratic socialist and socialist are often treated as interchangeable terms, which can be confusing given democratic socialists don\u0027t necessarily think the government should immediately take control of all aspects of the economy.They do, however, generally believe the government should help provide for people\u0027s most basic needs and help all people have an equal chance at achieving success.\u0026nbspMs Ocasio-Cortez\u0027s platform, for example, calls for universal healthcare, tuition-free college, and treats housing as a common right.Democratic socialists also believe strongly in democracy and democratic principles. They are by no means proponents of authoritarian government systems many Americans associate socialism with.\u0026nbspAs the DSA\u0027s website states: At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end. As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.To put it another way, they don\u0027t feel socialism should be forced on people, but they are fundamentally anti-capitalist and believe the government should urge privately owned businesses toward granting workers as much control as possible.\u0026nbspThe DSA and Democratic socialists like Ms Ocasio-Cortez place a great deal of emphasis on social justice in conjunction with pushing for an economy that\u0027s largely controlled by workers.\u0026nbspLeft to their own devices: New Liverpool exhibition examines effect of socialism on artThe DSA supports reforms that would decrease the influence of money in politics, empower ordinary people in workplaces and the economy, and restructure gender and cultural relationships to be more equitable, according to its website.To put this into context, Ms Ocasio-Cortez\u0027s platform calls for an end to the war on drugs, the demilitarization of police departments, and the abolishment of for-profit prisons.\u0026nbspI mean, to me, it means democracy, frankly, Senator Sanders added.

That was exactly what the meeting had been about, and everybody there knew it.The summit was Operation Save Mutti. Their mission: To stop Merkel’s government collapsing by thrashing out a tough stance on immigration to calm her critics. It’s quite a turnaround.Once, Merkel, with her open-door refugee policy, was queen of Europe. Now she’s a beggar. Suddenly, European politics has changed beyond recognition.The tide has turned. Those making the case for an open Europe are haunted and chastised. They are losing elections.Italy’s new coalition of left and right-wing populists is a fiesta of political contradictions, but they share one goal: To stop the migration population from growing.They want a European refugee policy that is pretty similar to what Austria is advocating.Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s young and energetic Chancellor, has begun to talk about “an axis of the willing” between his country, Italy and Germany.He has canvassed allies in Germany for his ideas on migration reform.Many in Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are tired of her and her centrist style of leadership and see Kurz as their hero.Earlier this month he staged a press conference with Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister, coalition partner and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party.Seehofer now wants Germany to turn away migrants who do not have documents or who first applied for asylum in another EU country. Merkel has refused. If the decades-old CDU-CSU alliance ends over this issue, Merkel’s government would collapse.Until recently, it was assumed that Merkel would last until the next elections in three years’ time.Now many are betting she won’t even make it through the summer.There are two kinds of European solidarity now: The Merkel type and the Kurz type.To survive, Merkel must find a way to reconcile the two, but she is perhaps the only leader in Europe who thinks that is still possible.Countries to the north, south and east of Germany have already moved away from her refugee vision.Denmark and Sweden reinstated border controls in 2015.Viktor Orban, in Hungary, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, in Poland — often dismissed as loonies and fruitcakes — feel that their views on immigration have been vindicated, not just at home but across Europe. And why shouldn’t they?Much as their migration policies are flawed, they are winning the battle of ideas over border controls and openness.They have many new allies in European capitals. Slovakia and the Czech Republic now have leaders who complain about Muslim immigration.And yes, Emmanuel Macron’s victory was astonishing — but a third of France still voted for right-winger Marine Le Pen.Merkel’s view of Europe was the consensus. When Macron took power, it was hoped Europe would be purged of grubby thoughts about migrants.Merkel’s case for a common European policy on refugees seemed likely to win.But the elections in Italy and Austria changed all that. Having populists in former Soviet bloc states is one thing. Having them running Western European states is quite another.The balance of power keeps changing, shifting ever further from Merkel.The incoming Slovenian PM, Janez Jansa, is a migration hardliner and, like others in the Balkan region, sees Europe’s political future as being represented by Budapest rather than Berlin.So what to do? Merkel now stands as the charity case, not the powerbroker.Macron offers her some respite, saying he will help her by taking back the few asylum seekers in Germany who registered first in France.But far more refugees will have registered first in Italy, and the odds on its new government taking them are slim. In Austria, Kurz is focusing on a plan to force refugees to apply for asylum before they enter the EU.When Austria assumes the EU’s rotating presidency next month, Kurz will make this a centrepiece of his agenda. Kurz’s stance is unacceptable to Merkel. Belgium and the Netherlands are also protesting because they fear that forcing migrants to apply from overseas centres will lead to inhumane migration detention camps, as seen in Australia.But can Merkel fight against it?If she wants to stay in power she will need to be wary of those in her own CDU ranks who are closer to Seehofer.If her leadership recently took them to their worst election results since 1949, what might await them after more years of Merkel in power?Whatever she now chooses to do will cause her reputation to crumble.If she fires Seehofer, it may be the end of the German centre-right as the party in charge.If she goes along with Austrian and Italian demands to turn back migrants, she will be admitting that her open-door policy on migration killed her own vision of a welcoming Europe.She has run out of good options, as well as political authority. She may limp on in Germany for a few more years, but her long reign in Europe has ended.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since then Johnny has seen his life spiral out of control.He admits to struggling with drugs and depression and he’s lost much of his £459million fortune.He’s embroiled in court battles over money and was pictured recently looking incredibly thin and pale.When I interviewed him at the end of last year he was clearly “well refreshed” and virtually incoherent.Maybe having to face up to his child’s health problems could actually be a turning point for Johnny.His family need him right now and he will have to step up to the mark. ONE of the feel-good ­stories of the week was the kind students who raised enough money to send Bristol University cleaner Herman Gordon to visit his family in Jamaica.Herman was beside himself with happiness and cried tears of joy when he opened his gift envelope to find it stuffed with cash for the trip.He’s clearly a very ­special man and much loved by the students, who said he brightened their lives and they simply wanted to give him ­something in return.Herman was part of the Windrush generation and can’t afford to go back to Jamaica too often.But now he and his wife can have a wonderful visit.This little shaft of light gives me hope for the future and shows there is still a lot of decency in the world.Herman also now knows that he makes a real difference and is greatly valued – and you cannot put a price on that. A HUGE thank you to everyone at Edinburgh Napier University, which presented me with an honorary arts doctorate this week.It was so moving to see all the young, hard-working students come up on stage at the Usher Hall to receive their degrees in front of beaming parents, family and friends.Two years ago I saw my daughter Rosie awarded her honours degree in journalism on the very same stage.I was so proud of her I could have burst.It was lovely to be able to follow in her footsteps and it really was a day to remember.  DESPITE not having watched a frame of Love Island, I’m obviously well aware of the show that has divided the nation.But what really strikes me is how similar they all look in the promos and newspaper photos.It’s no wonder the girls bounce from one chap to another when they are merely identical hairless Ken dolls.The same goes for most of the girls. The hair colour and bikinis might be a different hue, but they have that heavily browned, slightly startled, puffy-mouthed look of a sex doll.Which I suppose is the point.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting. Scientists are apparently closer than ever to inventing an invisibility cloak.I’m sure it’s intended for use by top secret agents intent on saving the world.But all I can think about is what a great accessory it would be for any party at which there are people you don’t fancy talking to.Or for eavesdropping on Apprentice candidates.Or spying on the half-time huddle of any team West Ham is playing.In fact, the possibilities are endless.HONESTLY there is no pleasing some people. The number of moans I have heard this week about people who think it is too hot.Just cast your mind back to the past couple of years when it rained solidly for most of June and July – and count your lucky stars.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which is unprecedented in its bluntness - has been leaked to The Sun.In it, former US Marine Corps general Jim Mattis says Washington DC is “concerned” that Britain’s military prowess is “at risk of erosion”.With threats around the world spiralling, America now expects the UK to hike its cash to the military to help counter them “beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests”.In an ominous threat, the general also makes it very clear that while Britain may want to “remain the US partner of choice”, France is already boosting its defence spending - and is waiting in the wings to replace us.President Trump wants an answer from the UK by the time he arrives in Europe next week for the NATO Summit, Mattis adds.The letter’s revelation today is a deep embarrassment to Theresa May, and plunges her into a fresh political crisis.Defence Secretary Mr Williamson, backbench MPs and British generals have all pleaded with her to hike the MoD’s budget and fill its £20bn blackhole.But the PM is adamantly refusing, alongside Chancellor Philip Hammond.The letter from highly respected General Mattis - nicknamed “Mad Dog” when he was in the Marines -  was sent on June 12, three days after he held talks in London with Mr Williamson while his guest at Trooping the Colour.In the two page letter, General Mattis argues that Britain’s position as a leading world power “has been the credibility of the UK’s armed forces”.But he adds: “I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change”.For the first time in the letter, the senior US politician also gives a firm hint that Washington now wants Britain to go beyond  the NATO minimum of spending 2% of GDP on defence, which the government only just about meets at the moment with the inclusion of pensions.Mattis adds: “A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defense (sic) spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests.“Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk”.Purposely highlighting Paris’s recent pledge to pump an extra £260bn into bolstering its armed forces by 2025, Mattis adds: “As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defense.“Other allies are following suit.”And dropping the hint that the Special Relationship is now in peril with France in ther wings, Mattis goes on: “It is in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice.“In that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability.“It is not for me to tell you how to prioritize your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defense blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.“In advance of that, the President and I look forward to hearing details of the progress you have made with your Modernizing Defence Programme at the upcoming NATO Summit.”Generals are calling on Mrs May to increase the MoD’s budget to 2.5% of GDP a year, which would see a cash increase of £6bn-£7bn.In comparison, the US spends 3.6% of the biggest GDP in the world on its military.But Mrs May has infuriated Tory backbenchers by repeatedly refusing to commit to maintaining the UK’s status as a Tier One military power, saying only that the UK would be a “leading nation” instead.Former Chief of Defence Staff Lord Houghton warned on Saturday: “US observers have come to realise we are living a lie.“President Trump is not remotely impressed by our national pretension to be America’s greatest ally.”The letter will also be seen as more evidence that Mrs May’s relationship with Donald Trump is under increasing strain.Fears are mounting in Downing Street that the President will use next week’s NATO summit in Brussels to announce a major US drawdown unless more members states step up their military funding.The letter – leaked to The Sun by military sources – has been copied to the Chiefs of the three armed forces, as well as No10, and National Security Advisor Sir Mark Sedwill.Senior Tories last night called on Mrs May to urgently act on  Mr Mattis’s warning.Former  defence minister Mark Francois MP told The Sun: “For many months, the Defence Committee has been arguing that we must increase our defence spending, not least to remain a credible ally of the Unietd States.“This letter is a real wake up call that we need to invest to maintain our leardership in NATO, and I hope the Prime Minsiter takes urgent note.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It involves another woman having a baby for couples who are unable to conceive, carry to full term or give birth for any reason.The law says courts should only sign over parental rights if surrogates have received no more than reasonable expenses. It is supposed to stop people profiting from the practice and protect wannabe parents who may be vulnerable to exploitation.But charity Surrogacy UK says judges are allowing larger payments if they are convinced it is in the “best interests of the child”. Natalie Smith, from the charity, told a fertility conference in Barcelona that surrogacy in the UK typically costs £6,000 to £12,000.This includes compensation to the surrogate for time off work and maternity wear, medical bills, legal fees and travel expenses. But a study by the University of Kent found four in ten couples spend more than £15,000, with some paying up to £60,000.It is not known how much of this is going on legitimate costs and how much is being pocketed by the surrogates as extras. Natalie, 37, who had twins using a surrogate, added: “If someone pays more than reasonable expenses the judge does have some flexibility. I think that’s important because the welfare of the child must trump everything, even though I feel very strongly about not supporting commercial payments.”Norman Wells, from the Family Education Trust, said: “It is difficult to see how the commercialisation of reproduction can ever be in the best interests of the child.“It is adults who control the market and therefore it will always be adults who stand to gain from it.“Whenever reproduction is removed from the natural order, it is inevitable that some people will try to cash in on it and children will be seen as commodities and a means to the end of making a small fortune.” Surrogacy contracts are not legally enforceable in the UK and the surrogate is the legal mum until a court issues a parental order.There were only 55 parental order applications in England in 2007 but this had rocketed to 316 by 2016.The Department of Health says the increase reflects “the broadening diversity of families, with more LGTBQ+ couples and people with fertility difficulties turning to surrogacy”.Natalie, from London, was speaking at the annual conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

or what they coyly refer to as novel weapon technology.“And the files reveal they were desperate to capture this technology - wherever it came from - before the Russians or the Chinese got hold of it first.“Although this was 1997, Russia was still regarded as undefeated enemy with a weapons programme regarded as a threat to the West.”Alien experts claim there have been more than 100,000 recorded UFO sightings worldwide in the past 100-plus years."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000276899927.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit negotiator trade deal jacob rees mogg","story":"Oliver Robbins -

It’s sparked fresh concern Russia may have sought to influence the outcome of the EU Referendum .   Deals offered to Mr Banks included a gold mine venture in Guinea, West Africa and a stake in the privatisation of Alrosa, Russia’s state-controlled diamond mining firm, according to the Sunday Times.  Banks said he did not take part in any of the deals.

Of the National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation, Mr Banks said: “Let them investigate. All of this just makes me look like an international man of mystery.” The new evidence came as Nigel Farage, who fronted Banks’ Leave.EU campaign faced further questions over whether he prematurely admitted defeat on Referendum night, to help hedge fund pals cash in on the pound bottoming out.

The Premier League said: “We have discussed the Football Lads Alliance with the UK Football Policing Unit, and the Home Office.  These reports are very concerning.”  The FLA was set up last year as an “anti-extremist” movement but has become increasingly associated with far-right activists. Up to 10,000 joined the Alliance’s first London protest in June last year. They also held a rally in Birmingham with anti-Islam activist Anne Marie Waters as speaker.

Then it’s probably time to upgrade your stereo to something with more features and better performance…\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHolly Thatcher17:29, 28 JUN 2018Updated17:13, 29 JUN 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen you think back to the family car journeys from your childhood, there’s a good chance that many of them were spent listening to the crackle and whine of a sporting event played out on an old-fashioned medium wave radio. Given how much the technology in our homes has advanced, it’s surprising how many of us are still using a last generation radio– particularly as DAB upgrades and wireless connectivity for cars are so affordable. If you think it could be time for an upgrade, here\u0027s some helpful tips for choosing a stereo, and some specific recommendations. Upgrading for sound   Depending on the age of your car, even a modest update could improve the sound. Even if your car came with a digital radio, it might even be worth upgrading to one that supports DAB+ for even better digital quality and more stations. What can your car handle?   Car stereos are usually sold in two sizes: either single or double DIN. As a rule, a double DIN stereo will be able to offer you a bigger screen. It’s far easier to create a stereo that offers built-in navigation in a double DIN socket, and with many modern stereos offering video playback when you’re stationary, it’s useful to have the extra screen size. What to look for in an upgrade   If your car stereo doesn’t have Bluetooth built in, then upgrading will give you access to the music on a Bluetooth-equipped phone. That means you\u0027ll be able to listen to music streamed from Spotify or Apple Music while you drive. Many car stereos have a 3.5mm line-in (headphone jack style), while some now offer USB ports. So even if your phone isn\u0027t Bluetooth enabled, connecting an iPhone, iPod or Android phone will allow you to play music over the USB connection and keep your phone charged at the same time. The Sony MEX-N4200BT offers all of the above and costs just \u0026pound99. There’s even a CD player here for your retro music (so the kids can say, what’s that funny silver circle?). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto   One of the greatest upgrades you can get for your car is to add support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Stereos that use these are designed to make your phone an important part of your entertainment system - they allow you to navigate, communicate and play music, with intelligent voice control via Bluetooth (Siri with Apple CarPlay or voice control with Android Auto). You’ll need a recent phone to use either system. CarPlay works on the iPhone 5 and newer, while you need Android Lollipop (version 5) on your phone to use Android Auto. But not all Android phones support Auto, so be sure to check before buying anything. Some stereos support both CarPlay and Android Auto while some only offer one or the other. Again, it’s wise to check before you buy - Halfords experts can help you choose the right stereo for both your car and phone. Once connected to either system, you’ll be presented with a selection of apps: Google Maps for navigation on Android or Apple Maps on an iPhone. You can also access your music and podcasts through the clear and intuitive interface. Many systems will also give you hands-free calling and voice-activated features like Siri. Touching your phone while driving is now illegal, but upgrading allows you to still use your phone while staying within the law. Being able to change songs using Siri or say “OK, Google, send a message to Mum,” is really great if you’re running late and don’t want to stop to safely use your phone.

The Sunday Times reports that at least 40 secondary schools have already banned skirts, with others consulting on changing their policy. Priory School in Lewes, East Sussex, have banned skirts after pupils asked why its uniform was different for boys and girls. At Woodhey High School, Bury, skirts were considered undignified and embarrassing if girls sat on the floor. In Bradford, several schools with a high proportion of Muslim pupils prohibit skirts on modesty grounds. The majority of schools in Ipswich are “trouser-only” and skirt bans are also common in Leeds and Grimsby. The moves come as the Government sets out the rights of transgender people in the Gender Recognition Act, with a consultation set to be published on Tuesday.  Philips High School in Whitefield, Greater Manchester, is to introduce a ban on skirts in favour of trousers this September. The move has been branded ‘crackers’ by one parent, who said there is nothing wrong with the existing uniform for girls. Girls due to start Philips as Year 7s in the autumn term will not be allowed to wear the same navy knee-length skirts worn by existing pupils. Girls in Year 8 to 11 will still be allowed to wear their skirts for one more year, but will then have to adhere to the new uniform rules in 2019. Mum Diane Burdaky, whose daughter Annabelle is in Year 8, claims parents were never consulted about the changes.  The mum-of-three, who attended Philips herself, told the Manchester Evening News : “A few months ago my daughter came home and said they were changing the school uniform and that girls were no longer going to be allowed to wear skirts.  It was the first I’d heard of it. There was no letter or email. No word or consultation from the school at all. “I looked on the website and there was a notice saying all new students from September will have to wear trousers and then the rest of the school will follow in September 2019. “I’m all for a school uniform policy. I think it’s very important that parents work with the school to make sure the rules adhered to. “My problem is why this has happened. I can’t think of any reason why girls shouldn’t wear them. “It’s good to give girls the option of wearing a skirt or trousers, but I don’t understand the need for a total ban. I think it’s crackers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how cool down your car","story":"NewsHow to cool down your car as quickly as possible during Britain\u0027s heatwaveMost motorists will be familiar with the stifling heat that can build up in your car\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByCaroline JonesZosia Eyres17:08, 1 JUL 2018Updated18:24, 1 JUL 2018NewsThe UK is experiencing a heatwave - making cars sweltering (Image: The Image Bank)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe amazing weather the UK is enjoying brings many benefits - but when you factor a car into the equation, it can all get pretty unpleasant. Most drivers will be familiar with the sweltering heat that comes with climbing into your vehicle on a hot day. Sometimes you barely have time to catch your breath as you struggle to switch your Air Con onto full blast. Thankfully, the Liverpool Echo has put together a list of tips which will hopefully stop your car getting so hot in the first place. If all else fails - will be a helping hand with cooling it down.  How can I stop my car from getting so hot? It\u0027s not an easy task because, you may not have intentionally parked your car in the sun - but the earth moves, so the sun will move with it, becoming really difficult to avoid it altogether. Here\u0027s some advice from the RAC: 1) Park away from direct sunlight - the obvious solution but it might as well be said. The RAC said: Parking in the shade – perhaps under a tree or canopy – is one easy way to prevent your car heating up. If you have a garage, then use it. It will keep your car cool, clean and secure. 2) Use a windscreen sunshade - according to the RAC: A windscreen sunshade keeps the sun\u0027s rays away from your car interior – especially the touch-points, such as the steering wheel and gear lever. They are available from most car accessory shops simply tuck the shade behind the sun visors when you park the car.  3) Cover your seats - the RAC said: Most modern car cabins are black and that\u0027s bad news for keeping cool. Leather seats, in particular, can get uncomfortably hot and sticky – and may degrade and crack if regularly exposed to heat. Fitting light-coloured seat covers is one solution, or you could opt for lighter upholstery in the first place. As a temporary measure, a towel spread over the seat will help keep you cool. 4) Wipe down hot surfaces - the RAC states: On very hot days, the interior door handles, steering wheel, gear lever and handbrake may become painfully hot to touch. Wiping them over with a damp cloth will remedy this. 5) Keep the air-con maintained - it said: Keeping the air conditioning system maintained is vital for cooling your car quickly and effectively. The refrigerant gas will usually become depleted over time and belts may need tightening or replacing. Consult your car handbook and stick to the service schedule.  How can I cool down a hot car? If you\u0027ve not had chance to implement any of the above, then this is a good question - and the RAC has five suggestions to help with this: 1) Fan the interior - it said: Open both the windows on one side of the car, then \u0027fan\u0027 the interior by swinging a door on the opposite side back and forth. Providing you\u0027re not worried about potentially looking a bit weird, repeat this open-close motion at least three times to help expel the hot air. Leave the sunroof shut if the car is parked outside in sunlight, though. 2) Switch on the air conditioning, correctly - the emphasis being on the word correctly, there. The RAC said: Captain state-the-obvious has arrived, but just in case you didn\u0027t already know... Start the engine and switch the air conditioning to its coldest setting. If your car offers the option, select the \u0027external\u0027 air setting (the symbol on the switch usually shows an arrow entering the car), rather than air recirculation (a circular arrow). The air outside the car will be cooler at this point. Open all remaining windows, as the air-con system will take a few minutes to become effective.

Emergency services were called to the area, known locally as Pebble Peach, to help three men in the water. A man who was pulled out by specialist water-rescue crews was later pronounced dead.  Police do not believe the death to be suspicious and issued a warning about the dangers of swimming in open water, Derbyshire Live reports .

A first I thought \u0027she\u0027s just playing under the water\u0027 but I said to my dad about it and within that time we noticed she hadn\u0027t come up or was kicking her legs. My dad rushed over at that point and picked her up. Her body was floppy and I couldn\u0027t see her face as her head just flopped forwards. Ben added: I grabbed the girl by the arm and pulled her out the water. Her lips were blue and her eyes were open. I rushed through the water and carried her up the ladder in my arms before placing her on the side .  Carin said: The lifeguards then evacuated the pool and performed CPR on the girl as everyone stood on the side in complete silence and watched. We were all just hoping she was going to be ok. They got her her breathing but then she fell unconscious again before the paramedics got there and got her breathing again. Police told us she was only six years old. Carin said the little girl\u0027s mum was really upset after the incident and police hailed her dad a hero. But Ben said: I don\u0027t really feel like a hero - I\u0027m just glad she\u0027s ok.

Hindu Kaye-Kisambira, 27, gave birth to two identical girls and two boys, called Asma, Hana, Ahmed and Ayub. Lawyer Hindu carried the babies to 32 weeks, and had to have twice-weekly scans to monitor her little ones. She had a complicated pregnancy because the girls were not equally sharing their placenta – leaving one girl receiving a reduced blood flow. But they were all delivered safely by Dr Asma Khalil and a team of more than 30 medics, on June 21.  The foursome were the first set of quads to be born at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, London, in 13 years. Quadruplets are incredibly rare, and only two such births recorded in England and Wales in 2014, three in 2015 and five in 2016. Hindu, from Cobham, Surrey, who already has a two year old son called Haris with her husband Farouk Kisambira, said: “I was so nervous but also really excited. I knew I was in the best hands with Asma. “I can never thank her enough. It was so lovely to see her reaction when I told her that I’d named the first born baby girl, Asma, after her!” During Hindu’s pregnancy, the identical twin girls were not sharing the placenta equally, known as ‘selective fetal growth restriction’. This meant that one of the girls had reduced blood flow through the umbilical cord, meaning she was smaller than the other twin.  Hindu, was transferred to St George’s for specialist multiple birth care from her local hospital at 24 weeks. The identical twin girls were born first, weighing 1.21kg and 1.55kg, followed by the boys, weighing 1.54kg and 1.70kg. Dr Khalil, consultant obstetrician and multiple pregnancy service lead, said: “It was a great achievement to be able to carry on with the pregnancy until 32 weeks despite the complication, which is above the average gestational age for this type of pregnancy. “This is really important as the risk of prematurity, and the associated risk of disability, in multiple pregnancy is increased. “Quadruplets are incredibly rare, so we were all very excited.

Whitchurch High School in Cardiff could be forced to pay damages after pupils left a prized marble sculpture housing a picture of the Madonna and child in pieces while exploring Florence. The ornamental cabient, known as the tabernacle of Canto alla Paglia, was found shattered metres away from the city\u0027s famous cathedral on Friday.  A 15-year-old pupil was questioned by police for damaging public property before being released at 2.45am, Wales Online reports .

It is believed one pupil then climbed on the shoulders of another to reach the object when the ledge gave way. According to Italian news reports, the marble tabernacle contains a picture of the Madonna and child from the late 16th Century. It has infuriated many in the world-renowned Italian city with one blogger calling for the culprits to be banned from Italy for life.  Pictures from the scene show a cordon around the broken monument surrounded by shocked passers-by. The Renaissance painting inside the recess appears to be undamaged. On Friday the Italian Polizia Municipale confirmed damage to the monument had been caused by pupils at a Welsh school. A source at the Polizia Municipale said the ornament will now be assessed before the case is brought before a judge, where it will be decided whether the school will have to pay damages. The incident took place during a five-day trip to Italy for Whitchurch High School\u0027s design and technology department. Pictures from the school\u0027s Twitter page show pupils enjoying the city where they visited the Ducati motorcycle factory, among other attractions.

Sally Osman, Royal Director of Communications, would be the latest senior figure to leave her post following the resignation of the Queen’s top aide Sir Christopher Geidt, who claimed he was a victim of a power struggle last year. In the past Ms Osman, 57, has led communications for a number of media companies including Sky, Sony and the BBC. She was brought in Clarence House as Communications Secretary for the Prince of Wales in 2013 on a six-figure salary. The departure, revealed by The Mail On Sunday , comes following a series of PR storms for the Royal Family around the marriage of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle.  Speaking to the , Ms Osman refused to comment on her position. She said: We do not comment on speculative diary stories. Any announcement about any staff movements are made in the appropriate way at the proper time. There is no suggestion that the reported departure has anything to do with the recent controversy related to Mr Markle. Yesterday, claims emerged the Duchess of Sussex hasn’t spoken to her father Thomas since his controversial interview with Good Morning Britain in which he revealed Prince Harry’s political views. The 73-year-old, who was handed a \u0026pound7,500 appearance fee, said the Royal was ‘open to Brexit’ and ‘wants people to give Trump a chance.’ He also discussed how his daughter told him she wished to have kids. Mr Markle also made headlines shortly before the wedding when footage emerged of him staging paparazzi shots which were then reportedly sold for \u0026pound100,000. The US former TV lighting director then announced he would not be walking his 36-year-old daughter down the aisle because of his precarious heart conditions.  The breakdown in communications comes a week after Mr Markle took a dig at the Queen over her meeting with US President Donald Trump when he arrives in Britain in a fortnight. He told TMZ on Tuesday: “If the Queen is willing to meet our arrogant and insensitive president she has no excuse not to meet me, I\u0027m nowhere near as bad. Meghan released a poignant statement after news broke her dad wouldn’t attend the wedding. She said: Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.  I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. “Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday, she added. Despite recent events, images emerged yesterday of the Duchess of Sussex looking happy and relaxed when she cheered on her husband at the Audi Polo Cup in Berkshire.

But how does it all work behind the scenes and what\u0027s it like to work for the fast food giant?       Having digested countless Big Macs over the years, reporter Sam Jones tried his hand working at the 24-hour restaurant in Skelton, Teesside.    From taking orders at the drive thru, to frying chips and cooking quarter pounders. Sam takes us through his two hours in uniform....      My guide for the first stint in the kitchen was crew trainer Dan Mortimer, a young man who has aspergers - a form of autism - but says McDonald’s has been great for him and given him confidence. He told me the clear workflow means he can follow everything efficiently and his condition means he always does everything “the right way.” After putting on my uniform for the day, the handwashing station was the first port of call. Staff have to wash their hands every 30 minutes and sign off whenever they do, which McDonald’s say is safer than wearing gloves. The first thing that strikes you in the back area is the pace of work - it’s hectic and demanding.  But a well thought out system, coupled with clever technology brings organisation to the chaos. Sophisticated screens calculate how many people are in the store and inform staff of how much food they need to have prepared, although this can be adjusted by the manager.  Watching Dan make a Big Mac at the prepping station seemed simple enough - or so I thought.  Two quick orders flashed up on the screen and it was my time to shine! Getting each section of the bun into the right toasting slot is the first challenge which, despite seeming simple enough, takes a bit of practice.  A squirt of the company’s famous Big Mac sauce follows before you grab a dash of onions, some lettuce and a couple of gherkins. A slice of cheese is next, followed by the beef, then comes the tricky bit, piecing it all together, which despite seeming like a jigsaw puzzle at first, gets easier with practice. Dan then challenged me to a competition to see who could make the best one - I’d argue mine was better, although I’m sure he’d disagree - either way, they both set off down a conveyor belt chute to be served to diners. It’s easy to forget when you collect your order what it takes to put a burger together - each one is carefully constructed and brought out nice and fresh.  Learning how to fry the fries No trip to McDonald’s is complete without the chips (I won’t get into the debate of whether you should eat them or the burger first - it’s definitely the burger first). Thankfully for me, the process of cooking them is simple enough. Their journey begins in the freezer before spending a couple of minutes in hot oil in the fryer, they’re then poured into a heated area with care taken to stock rotate and move the older ones along into another section.  A sprinkle of salt and they’re ready to go. I wasn’t quite as fast as the pros when it came to boxing them up, but Dan assured me it gets easier with practice! So much technology keeps the drive thru moving  Perhaps one of the most fascinating things about my time spent in McDonald’s was the drive thru - so much technology makes it as efficient as possible. My guide to the takeout side of the business was Jola Peters, a crew trainer who serves every customer with a smile. Have you ever wondered how your order never gets mixed up when you order at the same time as a car next to you? Well the answer is the system takes a picture of you when you order - something I was slightly alarmed to find out given some of the states I’ve looked when pulling up at the ordering point! The thinking behind it is to ensure that orders do not get confused - when customers come to the window to pay you can check you’re serving the right person.  The cash machine even does the change for you to avoid mistakes and speed up the whole process. After a couple of miserable attempts at taking orders over a headset, I left it to Jola and set about investigating how the whole system works. The drive-thru is split into three key areas which is monitored closely by a computer system - where you order, the cashier and the presenter. Working to the computer targets, staff have 30 seconds to take the order, 20 seconds to take payment and 20 seconds to present the driver with their meal. All of this is monitored on a screen which compares how the store is performing with others in the Middlesbrough area. During my time in Skelton, the restaurant was sitting in first place, closely followed by Eston. “It’s not that we are competitive, but we like to be at the top,” said store manager Louise Probert. How the operation has changed over the years  So much has changed since Louise started working for the company as a 16-year-old in Hartlepool. In her 22 years of service she’s seen the business transform: “When I started we had to use microwaves, it’s completely changed through the years. “Even the drive-thru, we used to serve at the window, now it’s through head sets. “We introduced table service and the customers absolutely love it.” Her route to management saw her climb the ladder internally before later doing a degree alongside her job. “I never went to uni,” she explained. “I did the degree programme through Mcdonald’s and I graduated in 2016 - my kids got to see it and Mcdonald’s were fantastic with it.” Flexibility  The flexibility offered to consultant Leanne Norman, who manages nine stores in the Teesside area, has been helpful after her daughter was diagnosed with autism. “I have to go to quite a lot of appointments, so I went down to four days a week and McDonald’s has been very supportive,” she said. “My parents are really proud of me making a career out of it.” The company has been a big part of Leanne’s life - who also joined aged 16. She met her husband while working there, recently won an award which meant she got the chance to travel to Florida and in the last week climbed Ben Nevis in support of Ronald McDonald House Charities. ‘I have a great amount of respect for the staff’ "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather heatwave last another","story":"NewsUK weather: Heatwave to last another MONTH with glorious sunshine despite threat of thunderstormsPeople in parts of the country are set to enjoy temperatures of a sweltering 30C today - and forecasters say the great weather will continue\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsBySophie Evans11:10, 1 JUL 2018Updated11:31, 1 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Britain\u0027s heatwave is set to last another MONTH - with even more glorious sunshine, high temperatures and dry conditions, forecasters say.   The country is currently basking in very warm weather , despite the imminent threat of thunderstorms, torrential rain and hail in some areas.  Parts of the Midlands and London are expected to enjoy temperatures of 30C today, with higher levels of humidity than in previous days. And the great weather is set to continue throughout Wimbledon and likely for a further two weeks after that, according to forecasters. Today is expected to be a very warm or hot day for most of the country, with tomorrow also set to see extremely warm conditions and sunshine.  However, there could be showers across south-west England, where there will also be more extensive cloud cover, MeteoGroup UK says. Tuesday is set to be mostly dry with sunny spells, while Wednesday will be very warm for all - with the risk of thundery showers in places, it adds. Towards the end of the working week, temperatures are expected to remain well above average in many places, with hot conditions and warm nights.  Next weekend, it appears that high pressure will build from the Atlantic, with much of the UK staying dry and very warm, the Met Office says .  At present, the following week is also expected to see dry, settled and very warm conditions in central and southern areas, with rain possible at times.  The weather service adds: For the rest of July, the most likely scenario is that the fine weather looks set to predominate across the UK, with mostly dry, sunny and warm conditions, especially in the south. However, there are likely to be interludes of less settled weather, with some rain at times, especially across the far north and northwest of the country. Temperatures overall are likely to be above average during the second half of July, with some further very warm spells possible. However, temperatures may return to near average at times, particularly in any changeable spells of weather. Met Office meteorologist Helen Roberts said the good weather is set to last throughout Wimbledon, with just a few showers at times.  The first day of the tournament is expected to see 27C temperatures.  Speaking to the Evening Standard , Ms Roberts added that high pressure is expected across the country for the whole of the month.  There will be lots of dry, sunny and warm weather, she said.  According to the BBC weather forecast, the lowest maximum temperature over the next fortnight is an amazing 26C - on July 13.  It comes as the Met Office has issued a weather warning for thunderstorms - the first such advisory since the service was introduced.

Police are investigating whether the victims – seven women, two men and two boys aged 15 – committed suicide or were murdered at their home in Delhi, India. Nine were found hanging from an iron grill in the hall of the first floor of a three storey building with cotton and pieces of cloth over their eyes. A woman, who appeared to be in her sixties, was blindfolded and found hanging from a door frame in a room and a woman in her 80s was found dead and without blindfold on the floor of the hall.  They were found alongside several spiritual and mystical handwritten notes at the home in the Burari district. Police in the Indian capital have been left baffled by the deaths and but they confirmed they are investigating it as murder. Joint Commissioner of Police Alok Kumar said: We found handwritten notes detailing how hands and legs are to be tied and are quite similar to the manner in which the bodies of 11 persons were found. They are exhaustive notes and we are studying them.  The notes say if a group of 11 people follow these rituals, all problems would ease out and they would attain salvation. Some notes have dates on which they were written while others don\u0027t. All the notes talk about reaching the end and gaining peace. They bought sedatives and mixed it in the dinner the previous night and served it to the family. Police also found the family’s pet dog on the roof and the investigators are now trying to find fingerprint traces from its leash to deduce who killed who and also used the sedatives.

offered: “Re the story from Rob Boag about Alec Sharp.“I’m sure I met Rob before I came to Canada 53 years ago but I knew him as Rab.“Anyhow, like Rob, I also live in Canada, in Ontario, and was also at the Johnnies and Forebank schools.“Rob was correct about the schools, teachers and Shug Gourlay, but that isn’t the correct photo of the Alec Sharp you are inquiring about.“I know this because Alec was a buddy of mine.“We were both from the Hilltown area and both played for the Johnnies and Forebank school teams.“Alec was a year older than me and I followed him into the Forebank team when he left for St John’s.”Chick continued: “Our half-back line at the Forebank was myself, Davie Whytock and Dennis ‘Cootsie’ Briggs.“When we went to St John’s a year later, Cootsie and I were made first reserve for the first team and played with Alec and Shug.“Not all the time, though, as we were mostly in the second team.“Davie went on to Lawside Academy.”Chick revealed: “Alec, who was a time-served plater with Caledon, did come to Canada — twice, in fact!“The first time, he was in Montreal for, I think, about 10 years.“He played semi-pro there, then he went home to Monifieth and worked away on the oil rigs for a few years.“With his wife Betty, he then returned to Canada and this is when we met up again.“Unfortunately, arthritis took over and he decided to quit Canada and head home to Monifieth, where he passed away a few years ago.“His wife Betty still lives in Monifieth and we keep in touch.“Forebank Primary School produced a lot of good footballers, but Alec was one of the best.”Robert McConnachie’s take on ‘the mistake’ concerned the other AS, and was: “There must be two Alec Sharps, because the photo is of an Alec Sharp and the same person who worked on my house.“He was the player who had a trial at Rangers, turned up with his boots wrapped in newspaper and proceeded to disrespect Jim Baxter.“Another time, he turned up after the kick-off for a big Downfield game.“Asked why he was late, he said he was in a domino tournament in the pub and there was a big pot.“All these stories and more I had heard about Alec Sharp – and he confirmed them all to me when working on my house.“I hope others come on to help clear up the confusion.“I built my own house in 1979-80 and I am fairly sure Alec Sharp was a labourer for either the brickies or the plasterers.“He was a bit of a legend to me, so that’s why it stuck in my mind.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"blether can you help iain find out more about dundee football team victoria fc","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA

Dundee United.Players such as Paul Hegarty, Eamonn Bannon and Willie Pettigrew came in to the club and immediately made their mark as the Tannadice side improved year on year.This would culminate, of course, with League Cup successes, a championship title, great European runs and countless visits to Hampden on cup semi-final and final duty.However, not all of the manager’s signings worked out.One who got away, literally, was John Bourke.A cutting, dated October 3, 1978, revealed:Dundee United striker John Bourke, who walked out on the club before the start of the season, is to become a Kilmarnock player for a fee of £40,000.This is £20,000 less than United paid for him from Dumbarton a year ago last month.Bourke travelled through to Kilmarnock to meet Rugby Park manager Davie Sneddon last night.All in all, it was quite a day for the lanky 24-year-old for, only yesterday, he started a job as a PE teacher at Holy Cross Academy, Glasgow, having given up a similar post in Dumbarton when he agreed to become a full-time player at Tannadice.As far as Dundee United were concerned, it was a case of cutting their losses and accepting £20,000 less than what they paid for him.When Bourke first walked out on United, he said he would never come back to Tannadice and he intended packing up the game altogether.At that time, United were so annoyed at their player’s attitude that they would have been quite happy to see their £60,000 go right down the drain rather than see him get any benefit from his breach of contract.However, when Kilmarnock came on the scene, they made the decision to relent sufficiently to allow the deal to go through — even at a loss.In his brief spell with the Tangerines, Bourke played 28 league and cup matches and scored six times over a period where he was very unlucky with injuries, especially cuts to the face and head.After over four years at Rugby Park, in which he played around 140 games, Glasgow-born Bourke returned to Dumbarton and completed over a century of games for the Boghead side.Season 1986-87 saw him back in the local area as that season was spent with Brechin City, before he ended his senior career with another stint at Killie.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/59118eccdb664-e1530288290685.jpg ","title":"charity pop up shop opens today for two

given to someone in long-term care.That can include previously homeless people, those with mental health difficulties or substance addiction issues or those fleeing from domestic violence.The intention with such properties is to help the tenants adjust to living independently in the long term.The spokesman said: “As part of the redevelopment of Alexander Street, which has included wheelchair-adapted units, supported accommodation will be provided for a small number of people through the Dundee Health and Social Care Partnership with appropriate care packages.”The keys were handed to the first residents of new homes on Alexander Street in December following months of construction by Dundee City Council, in partnership with the Hillcrest Housing Association.A number of

I like that about him.“When I knew I was moving, these things were very important to me and that’s why I came here.“The tradition of the club I know and I’ve heard good things about it as well. It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league. There are a lot of good players and a lot of attention with what’s happened at Rangers.“Even without that it is still a good standard and a top league and this has all the makings of a good season for me.”Fans will got their first chance of a first look at Ralph last night when Dundee’s friendly programme kicked off with the short trip up to Brechin.Having finished playing at Woking back in April, he can’t wait to get back to a game situation.“I’m very keen to get started with the games and I’m looking forward to them, that’s what I came here for.“The Betfred Cup is coming soon but I feel with the fitness work we’ve been doing and, with the friendly games coming, we will be ready for them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1f819d44b02-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people customer base like a little community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tChoosing what to have for lunch in a bustling city centre can be a task, however, Brodie’s Takeaway has you covered.The blue-fronted shop on Bell Street is often the go-to place to grab a whole range of tasty homemade grub and it is all thanks to Cate and Ron Brodie who opened the shop almost 14 years ago.Cate said: “We already owned Brodie’s Coffee Shop in Forfar and we wanted to branch out and open another shop.“The premises we are in were already a takeaway when we took over.”After three years of running both businesses the couple decided to sell the coffee shop and focus on their Dundee business and their two children.Cate said: “We found with running two businesses and having two kids that we were just too widespread between the shops and we decided to sell the coffee shop.“It was a really hard decision to make, but with business you have to either go really big and hire managers or stay small and in control so that is what we have done.“It has also allowed us to get our weekends back to spend with our children.”Now the takeaway is thriving with masses of hungry locals heading in five days a week for the huge range of homemade food on offer.Cate appreciates though that the shop is in an ideal location with the High School of Dundee, Abertay University and the DC Thomson offices in close proximity and full of willing customers.“We have a huge amount of regulars now from all the local businesses.“The shop is now like a meeting point with everyone like a little community and we all know each other.“I also like to introduce people to each other while they are waiting in the queues for their food.“It is a way for them to network and meet new people and it’s also great for me getting to know everyone who comes in.”Now after more than a decade the owner couldn’t imagine not having the takeaway shop.“Although it is very hard work with my days lasting easily 12 hours and starting between 5-6am, I couldn’t imagine myself not having Brodie’s.“People may think it is easy, but there is a lot of work that goes on in the background that customers don’t see.Whatever you fancy to eat Brodie’s is more than likely to have it with an extensive menu ranging from homemade soups, sandwiches and burgers to daily specials including chicken curry and stovies, there is something for everyone.But owner Cate says it wouldn’t be possible without her three employees and her 81-year-old dad, Gordon Bruce.She said: “My dad is basically on call whenever we need him.

Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals. I hope going forwards from here that it will be the same this term at St Mary’s.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee united coach ian cathro teams up with former boss at wolves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Hearts boss Ian Cathro has been appointed first-team coach of Premier League newcomers Wolves.Dundonian Cathro, who spent eight months at Tynecastle, was Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo’s assistant at Rio Ave in 2012 and at Valencia.The pair met on a Scottish Football Association coaching course in 2009.“I am very excited about joining Wolves and looking forward to working with a coach and staff I know, trust and believe in,” said Cathro.“All of us share the same footballing philosophy and that is such an important factor for a successful coaching team.“Wolves is a fantastic club with a rich history and lots of potential, and I can’t wait to get started.”Cathro, who began his coaching career at Dundee United, has also been assistant boss at Newcastle and met the Wolves squad on Wednesday.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32069b78095-490x564.jpg ","title":"football is a labour of love for refreshed dundee united coach craig easton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAnyone who’s come across him down the years will testify enthusiasm has never been an issue with new Dundee United reserve team manager Craig Easton.As far back as when he was part of the youth system he’s now spearheading, Craig’s huge appetite for the game was always apparent.Even he, though, admits a spell out of the game a couple of years back was a perfect reminder of just how good life in football is.It came when financial problems at Torquay United forced him into an unexpected move back to Scotland and left him searching for work.Not content to sit around waiting for his next job, Eastie ended up working in the building trade and admits it was one of the best moves he’s ever made.“I was in England for 12 years and I didn’t even think of coming back up to Scotland to be honest,” he said.“But in football you can’t plan what’s going to happen, especially as a player and then, when I was coaching, I found things could change as well.“I was with Torquay working with the U/19s and college kids. It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time.

This concern has also been raised by a local member.“It is noted by one of the local members that residents of Invergowrie frequently raise concerns about the volume of traffic that uses the Main Street to avoid the Swallow roundabout in the evening peak. There is concern that the proposed scheme has the potential to cause an increase in vehicles using this route as a rat-run.“The application does not include any traffic flow modelling that could give reassurance in this regard. It is noted that drivers choose their routes based on what ‘appears faster’ and therefore might prefer to cut through Invergowrie rather than risk a relatively short delay at a traffic signal.”Ms Beer said that there had been 24 crashes on Main Street since 1999, which was more than similar villages in the area, and called for traffic surveys to be carried out if the work goes ahead. “This would allow the measurement of any resulting changes in (traffic) flow,” she added.“If there is such a change, with more vehicles travelling through Invergowrie, then a commitment to carry out any remedial works or an appropriate financial contribution should be required.”Councillor Richard McCready, whose West End ward includes the roundabout, said he had asked the council for details on the impact of the upgrade.He said: “Theoretically this should be a good thing but I don’t think the four ways you can go on this roundabout have equal traffic volumes.“I also want to make sure there are no adverse affects to the air quality in the area.”No details have yet been revealed on when the work to upgrade the roundabout will take place.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

care \u0026ndash is being proposed by a newly appointed champion.After months of stinging criticism over its treatment of people with autism NHS Highland has appointed occupational therapist Arlene Johnstone to be its first head of service for learning disabilities and autism.The health board faced a storm of criticism over its decision to withdraw a \u0026pound23,000 grant for the Highland One Stop Shop (HOSS) autism support service last year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s appointment, saying the group knows her well and is eager to find out more about her role.Ms Johnstone is happy to hear from anyone with concerns or

similar conditions impact people\u0027s ability to perform everyday tasks due to uncontrollable shaking.Sufferers treated at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London have experienced substantial improvement

alternative and invasive treatment.

I’m not going to leave anything.“With the budget we’re going to try to spend it and get the best level of players in.”Despite already landing three midfielders in the window McInnes had remained keen to sign Hibs’ Scotland international McGeouch.However, sources indicate Sunderland are confident of bagging McGeouch before they leave for their training camp in Portugal early next week.The 25-year-old travelled to the Stadium of Light for talks last week and the Black Cats are confident of pushing a deal through.It is understood McGeouch is keen on a move south of the border.Rangers, Fulham, QPR, Blackburn and Coventry City were also keen on securing the midfielder.Aberdeen signings Forrester, Gleeson and Ferguson were today set to make their debuts against Cobh Ramblers.Centre-back Mikey Devlin, who signed for the Reds in January, is also set to make his long-awaited debut.Defender Devlin has been ruled out for more than a year having suffered cruciate ligament damage in May 2017.The friendly will be played at the Reds’ Fota Island Resort training complex on the outskirts of Cork, Republic of Ireland.It is the first step in a series of friendlies that will culminate in a clash with West Brom on July 20 before the Battle of Britain with Burnley.McInnes said: “When we were drawn against Siroki Brijeg in the second qualifying round last year I felt we were undercooked a bit.“So this year, even before we drew Burnley, we decided to get more games in.“Now we know we’re playing against a team from the English Premier League, those extra matches are a necessity.”Aberdeen have exited at the third qualifying round stage of the Europa League in four straight seasons. They lost out to Real Sociedad (Spain, 2014), Kairat Almaty (Kazakhstan, 2015), Maribor (Slovenia, 2016) and Apollon Limassol (Cyprus, 2018).Burnley boss Sean Dyche has admitted the Premier League, not Europe, will be the main focus for the Turf Moor side next season.European football could have an impact on the domestic campaign for the Clarets who finished seventh in the top flight.However, the previous season they finished fifth bottom of the table in their first campaign back.McInnes reckons there is no way Burnley will take Europe lightly after a 51-year absence from continental competition.He said: “Burnley have waited more than 50 years to play European football again. Now that they are back in I am sure they will feel an obligation and that excitement about it.“It is a competition I wouldn’t imagine Burnley will take lightly.“The Europa League is a competition a lot of English teams think they can do well in as Manchester United won it in 2017 and Arsenal reached the semis this year.“Burnley are a team that have done fantastically well in recent seasons.“For them to finish just outside that big top six in the English Premier League is a fantastic effort.“They will be excited for the European adventure.“Facing an English Premier League team is as tough a game as we could have at this stage.“Burnley were the stand-out team in our pot during the draw and the most difficult one.”European football normally means overseas scouting missions for the Dons to get the lowdown on their opponent.That will not be needed this time although the Reds could yet have someone travel back across to Ireland next week as Burnley face Cork City in a friendly on Friday.Mcinnes said: “Rather than talking about some obscure team and trying to say how good they are we are well aware of the strength of Burnley.“It is different from our European experience of recent years but there is still that excitement nevertheless.“We are very proud that we have qualified for Europe for five years in a row and we want to do well.“It is clear we have a really tough task ahead of us but one we will be ready for.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"46k boost gets show on road for good cause","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA stage school and charity is celebrating after receiving nearly £50,000 in a national funding scheme.Music 4 U was one of five groups in the North Scotland category that reached the final of the People’s Project 2018.The charity, which offers artistic opportunities to young people aged between 16 and 25, has walked away with £46,465.The People’s Project, which is in its 13th year, is run by the Big Lottery Fund along with The National Lottery, STV and ITV.Music 4 U now has the funding in place to start its Music 4 Communities project which will take performances to people who may otherwise struggle to see live stage shows.Debbie Kirkness, founder and director of Music 4 U, said: “We’ve been a charity since 2005 and it has only really been in the last 18 months that people have been finding out about us and what we do.“Getting the funding for our Music 4 Communities project means everything to us.“We will be able to stage showcases with young people and we support people from all walks of life including with learning and physical disabilities.“We will then be able to take our showcases to communities that might not be able to go to live performances or would struggle to visit somewhere like a theatre.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Would you know who most at risk is, how to protect the area or whether you should remove the helmet of a downed rider?Following the success of the Biker Down courses last year in Oban Community Fire Station, new dates have been set for this summerTwo free sessions will be held in Inveraray Community Fire Station on July 8 and August 26 .As many bikers ride in pairs or in groups, it is often the case that the first person on scene following a collision involving a motorcycle will be a fellow biker.Actions taken in the first few moments after an accident can be crucial in minimising injuries and can make a real difference to the lives of those involved. But there can be some uncertainty about what to do in these situations.Training motorcyclists in how to deal with a casualty can save lives and Biker Down courses include ways of keeping the scene safe, first aid appropriate to common types of injury and the issues of safely removing a helmet.The course \u0026#8211 aimed at motorcyclists of all ages and experience \u0026#8211 uses the expertise of the emergency services to prepare motorcyclists should the worst happen on the roads. Biker Down is not about lecturing riders on the consequences of things going wrong – it is about equipping them to make a difference if they encounter an emergency.The course will show you:How to manage the scene of a bike crash, using the same principles the Fire Service uses. We will show you how to protect yourself and others, how to prioritise your actions, how to collect information for the emergency services and how to make use of the resources you have available to you, including other people.Ways of taking care of a casualty, including basic life support and the why, when and how of removing a crash helmet.What may work (or not work) when it comes to making yourself more visible to other road users. You will also learn about how people look for and recognise objects and how you can help to make sure that other road users see you.Scottish Fire and Rescue Service’s group manager for Argyll and Bute, Stuart McLean said: \u0026#8216Firefighters are frequently called to the scene of collisions and when a report comes through of one involving a biker there’s always great concern. Motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable and a crash that would be likely to cause only minor damage to a car could easily claim their life. A\u0026ampB is home to many country roads enjoyed by bikers, so road safety is clearly a key issue for our team.\u0026#8217Anyone interested in learning more about the Scottish Biker Down or would like to book one of the courses can email adam.barclay@firescotland.gov.uk to book your place on the course or visit our Facebook page ‘Biker Down Scotland’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"council pays formal tribute to islays ww100 group","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 2:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowArgyll and Bute Council has formally recognised Islay’s ambitious programme of events commemorating two World War One tragedies off the coast of the island.Council members thanked Islay\u0026#8217s WW100 committee for providing an inspirational programme of events to commemorate the centenary of the sinking of SS Tuscania and the collision of HMS Otranto, which took place off the shores of Islay during the Great War.At a meeting of the full council this week members paid tribute to the group for their part in organising the national remembrance events, honouring those who lost their lives in the incidents, and providing a lasting legacy for the local community.Provost of Argyll and Bute, Len Scoullar said: \u0026#8216The WW100 group both national and local must be congratulated for arranging such a well-organised series of events to honour and pay respect to those who lost their lives in these tragedies, and commemorate the people of Islay who were involved in the response to the incidents.\u0026#8216The island really came together, engaging young and old, showcasing resilience, compassion and kindness.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

He motored along his home street of Sycamore Crescent, Forehill, and Hillfoot Road before being caught by officers. A booze reading revealed that he had 119 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The limit is 22. The 50-year-old was banned from the road for 24 months at Ayr Sheriff Court last week. He must also undergo community supervision for 18 months. Depute fiscal Jason Bell sought to forfeit the vehicle but Sheriff Leslie refused.  The court heard Murdoch accepted he has a drink problem and was referred for counselling,  Sheriff Desmond Leslie said the circumstances of the offence “point to much more concerning abuse.”  "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"holiday goer caused ruckus prestwick","story":"NewsHoliday-goer caused ruckus at Prestwick AirportIan Graham acted in an aggressive and intimidating manner towards Steven Ringtoul, and made threats of violence in the presence of children.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post16:00, 28 JUN 2018NewsAyr Sheriff Court (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA holidaygoer who caused a ruckus at Prestwick Airport has been fined.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"andrews-mum-and-sis-go-the-distance-in-bid-to-find-cure","story":"THE family of a West Linton man struck down by a rare and debilitating health condition have raised almost \u0026pound10,000 with two marathon sporting challenges.\nAndrew Macnab was diagnosed last August with dermatomyositis.\nFewer than one in a million people are affected by the incurable condition which causes skin rashes, muscle weakness, and inflammatory myopathy.\nBut treatments can control the symptoms and research is ongoing to try to find a cure.\nLast month, Andrew\u0027s wee sister Helen, who lives in Stow, completed her very first marathon in Edinburgh - raising a staggering \u0026pound5,200 for Myositis UK.\nAnd just last week Andrew\u0027s mum Jean, along with her friends at West Linton Golf Club, raised a further \u0026pound4,100 with a 24-hour golfing challenge.\nThroughout the challenge Jean managed to play for the entire 24 hours - completing an amazing 140 holes.\nJean told us: \"Although I was a little weary by the end of the relay, I was over-joyed by the support and friendship from the members of West Linton Golf Club as well as many others from the village and beyond.\n\"The relay has raised funds to date of over \u0026pound4,100, providing another great boost for the funding of research by Myositis UK.\"\nBoth Jean and Helen are continuing to raise money for Mystosis UK which carries out research into the Andrew\u0027s condition.\nThe volunteer-led charity works to improve the diagnosis, treatment, understanding, and prognosis of the rare inflammatory myopathies.\nJean added: \"Andrew continues to fight against the effects of that illness, and has recently been showing small signs of improvement \u0026ndash at long last.\n\"We know that further research is essential to understand this rare illness, and find which treatments are most effective.\n\"As well as hoping that such research will improve Andrew\u0026rsquos chance of a full return to normal life, we hope that others suffering from this cruel illness can be helped.\"\nTo support Helen - www.justgiving/fundraising/helen-runs-edinburgh-marathon - or Jean - www.justgiving/fundraising/west-linton-ladies-golf - visit their justgiving pages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bins-set-alight-outside-hawick-shop","story":"WITNESSES are being sought after two bins were set alight near a shop in Hawick.\nThe fire happened at around 3.25am on Friday, June 22 on the town\u0027s High Street.\nTwo large metal wheelie bins were set alight at the rear of The Card Factory store, however quick action of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service mean the fire was extinguished before the flames could spread.\nAs a result, the outer wall and a window sustained damage, while one of the building vents was also destroyed.\nNo one was injured and inquiries are ongoing to identify whoever was responsible.\nInspector Kevin Harris from Hawick Police Station said: \"Had this fire spread then a number of homes and businesses could have been affected.\n\"We are keen to hear from anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious within the High Street during the early hours of Thursday morning, or who can help us trace the culprits.\n\"Anyone with information should contact police immediately.\"\nThose with information can contact Hawick Police Station via 101 and quote incident number 426 of June 22.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716326589,16326578,16326073,16323973,16325711\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.  One parent said: \u0026ldquoThe children are really disappointed but it\u0026rsquos the correct decision."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/5296837.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"common-school-day-across-east-lothian-proposed","story":"              A COMMON secondary school day could be introduced in East Lothian in an effort to ensure pupils have equal access to education.  A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.  Current school times: Dunbar Grammar School starts at 8.40am with a home time of 3.50pm Monday to Thursday and 12.30pm on Fridays Preston Lodge High School starts at 8.40am and finishes at 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.25pm on Fridays Knox Academy is 8.44am to 4pm Monday to Thursday, finishing at 12.05pm on Fridays Musselburgh Grammar School starts at 8.45am, finishing at 3.50pm and 12.30pm on Fridays North Berwick High School starts at 8.39am and finishes at 3.50pm \u0026ndash noon on Fridays Ross High School starts at 8.30am, finishing at 3.35pm \u0026ndash 11.55am on Fridays."},{"url":null,"title":"ormiston-park-formally-opens-after-years-of-refurbishment-work","story":"              SUPPORTERS of Ormiston Park celebrated its official opening on Saturday following four years of hard work.

They say they are being overlooked by customers at the supermarket car park who can see through the fence into the communal garden area in front of their ground-floor properties at Mill House on Eskmills Road, which is managed by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.  Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.  Another resident, who declined to be named agreed, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are getting no privacy and I can\u0026rsquot even sit out in the back garden for people looking in.  Alan Glasgow, Dunedin Canmore housing director, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware there are a small number of residents at Eskmills Road who have concerns about the garden fence.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to work with the community and local partners to see what can be done to help further increase privacy when people are using the nearby car park.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

These machines reward people for recycling by providing money or vouchers in return for empty containers.  Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.  The six-month trials are designed to help the company better understand consumer perceptions and appetite for plastics-recycling technology across the UK.  They come ahead of the expected launch of a national deposit return scheme to which the Scottish, UK and Welsh Governments have all announced their commitment in principle.  The trials will help Iceland to provide government and industry with insights that might support the creation of a national scheme.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

The debate during Health Question Time at Holyrood last Wednesday followed a recent public meeting which was organised by East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield and Lothian MSP Kezia Dugdale (both Labour) at the Fisherrow Centre, which attracted more than 200 people.  Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"              VIKTOR Krum, Percy Weasley and Malfoy\u0027s sidekick Goyle are all heading to Musselburgh this summer to join in the fun as Harry Potter\u0027s \u0026lsquoSchool of Witchcraft \u0026amp Wizardry\u0026rsquo arrives in the town.

WE ALL know that tadpoles turn into frogs. Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"              SCOTTISH Ministers are to be urged to refuse planning permission for an electrical substation on the former Cockenzie Power Station site because it could prejudice future development there.  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

Furious at spiralling corruption and violence, Mexican voters unleashed a political earthquake on Sunday by electing the leftist firebrand and giving him a broad mandate to overthrow the political establishment and govern for the poor.  A late-night official quick count from electoral authorities forecast that Mr Lopez Obrador would win with between 53% and 53.8% of the vote, a remarkable margin not seen in the country for many years.  A prominent exit poll predicted that his party allies were poised to score huge wins in the Senate and lower house, possibly absolute majorities in both.  US President Donald Trump tweeted his congratulations, adding: \u0026ldquoI look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!  Mr Lopez Obrador campaigned on vows to transform Mexico and oust the \u0026ldquomafia of power ruling the country.  He rode widespread voter anger and discontent with the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) of President Enrique Pena Nieto and had led opinion polls since the beginning of the campaign.  The PRI, which dominated Mexican politics for nearly the entire 20th century and recaptured the presidency in 2012, was set to suffer heavy losses not just for the presidency but in down-ballot races as well.          Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!          \u0026mdash Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2018  In brief remarks at a hotel in central Mexico City, Mr Lopez Obrador called for reconciliation after a polarising campaign and promised profound change that respects the law and constitutional order.  \u0026ldquoI confess that I have a legitimate ambition: I want to go down in history as a good president of Mexico, said Mr Lopez Obrador, who won after losses in the previous two elections. \u0026ldquoI desire with all my soul to raise the greatness of our country on high.  The president-in-waiting devoted much of his speech to appealing to citizens of all stripes and seeking to reassure those who have eyed his candidacy nervously.  \u0026ldquoThis new national project will seek to establish an authentic democracy and we do not intend to establish a dictatorship, Mr Lopez Obrador said. \u0026ldquoThe changes will be profound, but in accordance with established order.  Conservative Ricardo Anaya of a right-left coalition and the PRI\u0026rsquos Jose Antonio Meade acknowledged defeat shortly after polls closed nationwide.  The quick count had them around 22% and 16% respectively.  \u0026ldquoThe tendency favours Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. \u0026hellip I recognise his triumph, Mr Anaya said in a speech to supporters.  \u0026ldquoFor the good of Mexico, I wish him the greatest success, Mr Meade said minutes earlier.  Supporters began wild celebrations in Mexico City, cruising up and down the central Paseo de la Reforma boulevard honking horns to the tune of Viva Mexico! and waving Mexican flags from car windows and moon roofs.  Thousands poured into the sprawling main square known as the Zocalo, where the 64-year-old former mayor had called on his backers to rally Sunday night. Many danced to the trills of mariachi music.  Mr Lopez Obrador spoke to the crowd there around midnight, saying to loud applause: \u0026ldquoToday one stage has ended and we are going to begin another one \u0026mdash we are going to transform Mexico!  He said individual and property rights would be guaranteed, promised respect for the autonomy of the Bank of Mexico and said his government will maintain financial and fiscal discipline.  He said contracts obtained under energy reforms passed under President Enrique Pena Nieto will be scrutinised for any corruption or illegality, but otherwise contracts will be honoured.  \u0026ldquoThere will be no confiscation or expropriation of assets. \u0026hellip Eradicating corruption will be the principal mission, he said."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806594.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"castlemilk-singing-sensation-gerry-cinnamon-announces-four-glasgow-gig-dates","story":"              CASTLEMILK singing sensation Gerry Cinnamon has announced four Glasgow gig dates.

On Thursday, Glasgow recorded its hottest day since records began as another sweltering day saw the temperature peak at 31.9C (89.4F).  The city beat Wednesday\u0026rsquos high of 31.3C (88.3F) in Aviemore in the Highlands, and came close to matching the hottest June day ever recorded in Scotland - 32.2C (89.9F) at Ochtertyre in Perth and Kinross in 1893.  As tens of thousands of music lovers flock to Glasgow for TRNSMT at Glasgow Green and Fiesta x Fold in Kelvingrove Park, revellers are being urged to stock up on sunscreen and water.  Temperatures in the city will dip slightly, but it will still be warm for the week ahead with plenty of sunshine and temperatures around the 25C mark.  The first hosepipe ban is likely to come into place in Northern Ireland this weekend.  Northern Ireland Water said demand is outstripping supply, leaving them with no option but to bring in the ban in order to save water.  Scottish Water said it is managing supplies across the country and will continue to monitor the situation closely.  Only two localised areas in Scotland have been issued with advice to \u0026ldquouse water wisely - parts of Moray and the Stornoway area of Lewis.  Other parts of the UK have urged water consumers to take simple steps to reduce the amount they use.  Top tips include taking a shorter shower, not leaving the taps running and re-using paddling pool water for plants in the garden.  Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: \u0026ldquoWe are going to see a continuation of the current warm spell, but the temperatures over the next few days are not likely to be the warmest of the year so far.  \u0026ldquoI think, for now, temperatures have peaked and we are not expecting to see any records today.  \u0026ldquoWe will begin to have a slightly fresher feel, bringing the temperatures down, not by much, by one or two degrees.  Gritters have been deployed in some areas, spreading crushed rock dust onto melting roads to create a non-stick layer between the surface and vehicles.  Motorists have been advised to use warm soapy water to wash sticky tar from their vehicles.  Some railway tracks have soared to nearly 50C (122F), leading them to expand and bend.  ScotRail customers have seen massive disruption across the Glasgow network for three days now as the railway lines buckle in the hot weather, with many speed restriction in place for train drivers.  The Met Office\u0026rsquos heat-health watch alert has remained at level two all week, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.  This week is the first time since 2013 all four nations in the UK have seen temperatures of 30C or above, the Met Office said.  The rising temperatures have also come with warnings to be careful near water and in the countryside, where fire crews have been tackling wildfires, including one in Bathgate.  The heat has already claimed casualties.  The family of 13-year-old Ryan Evans, whose body was recovered on Wednesday, two days after he got into difficulty at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent, warned of the dangers of playing and swimming in open water.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe just cannot emphasise enough the dangers of swimming in open water, especially where young children are concerned.  \u0026ldquoOur message is simple: please don\u0027t do it.  A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search and rescue operation.  It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening.  The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday.  The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard.  There is bad news for farmers growing crops and the firefighters and soldiers battling the ongoing incident on Saddleworth Moor in north-west England as no significant rainfall is forecast in the coming days.  Parts of the Moor have been alight for six days, with firefighters saying it could take weeks to extinguish.  A new moorland blaze - on Winter Hill, near Rivington, Lancashire - broke out on Thursday with huge plumes of smoke visible from the area surrounding the moorland.  Firefighters are also still fighting a 500-metre long gorse fire on the Glenshane Pass in County Londonderry, more than 48 hours after it first broke out.  The RSPCA called on pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals in the heat after receiving 625 calls about animals in hot environments between June 11 and 24 - the majority about dogs in hot cars."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7996889.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"trnsmt-2018-bar-prices-at-glasgow-festival-revealed","story":"              THE bar prices have been revealed for TRNSMT festival.

Picking a favourite Scottish album from such a packed field was always going to be a tough task, and so it proved when we asked readers to do just that.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For more than 25 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

The Vow, signed by the then Prime Minister David Cameron, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband, appeared on the front page of the Daily Record two days ahead of the historic vote  However, the then Daily Record editor Murray Foote, says his motivation for publishing the pledge was to ensure the politicians kept to their word.  He added there was no evidence it lost the campaign for Yes which he believed failed because the economic case for independence was not strong enough.  Salmond hailed Foote, who stood down as editor of the Record in March, as \u0026ldquoa new recruit to the independence cause.  Foote came out in support of an independent Scotland this month.  However, Salmond said he disagreed with Foote about the impact of The Vow.  Salmond said: \"I warmly welcome Murray Foote as a new recruit to the independence cause but he heavily underrates the significance of the Vow which was a journalistic masterpiece but politically disabled Scotland at a crucial moment.  \u0026ldquoIt presented a No campaign then in total disarray with a rallying point in the final week of the 2014 referendum.  \u0026ldquoThe Daily Record provided an infinitely more credible vehicle than George Osborne and the Tory Government who first wanted to proffer the panicked promise of more powers."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-aide-says-nicola-sturgeons-reshuffle-lacked-due-diligence","story":"              THE chief of staff to Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos predecessor has criticised the lack of \u0026ldquodue diligence in advance of last week\u0026rsquos botched reshuffle.  Geoff Aberdein said the First Minister\u0026rsquos inner circle would be \u0026ldquokicking themselves over the on-off appointment of Gillian Martin as a minister.  Ms Sturgeon gave Ms Martin the further and higher education brief on Wednesday, but was forced to cancel her appointment the following day over her past blog writings.  In 2007, Ms Martin, then a college lecturer, had mocked transgender people and written in unflattering terms about \u0026ldquoAmerican Jews and \u0026ldquoAmerican blacks.  Ms Sturgeon had previously been aware of some of the transgender comments, including the notion of a \u0026ldquotranny trove of EU cash, as the blog was widely reported in 2016.  However more offensive material surfaced after Ms Martin was named a minister, including a remark about \u0026ldquohairy knuckled lipstick-wearing transitional transgender Laydees in colleges.  One of Ms Martin\u0026rsquos roles would have been to promote widening access to minorities.  Opposition parties said the episode had highlighted Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos poor judgment.  On BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, Mr Aberdein, who who was Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos top adviser from 2011 to 2014, was asked whether the reshuffle showed the SNP government was losing its previous sure-footedness.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt was unfortunate.  \u0026ldquoThe whole purpose of this reshuffle was to enter the summer recess on a high, with a bit of momentum, and of course the Gillian Martin saga has tarnished that.  \u0026ldquoI think the people around Ms Sturgeon will be kind of kicking themselves about the lack of due diligence here. Perhaps not as sure-footed as before.  \u0026ldquoBut you\u0026rsquove got to remember these things come and go very quickly, and in a couple of days we\u0026rsquoll forget about this, and the focus will be on the ministerial [team].  He suggested that if there had been better planning, the SNP could have headed off the media stories that followed the appointment.  Now global head of public affairs at Standard Life Aberdeen, Mr Aberdein said: \u0026ldquoHad that due diligence been done, then perhaps they might have been able to proactively, the SNP, deal with that, maybe spike it... as a political mechanism to see where the land lies beforehand, but of course that wasn\u0026rsquot done.  \u0026ldquoIt came as a surprise, and the result was there for all to see.  The U-turn on Ms Martin\u0026rsquos appointment means there will be no further and higher education minister until after the Holyrood recess, as MSPs must confirm the post.  However Ms Sturgeon could appoint a minister-designate over the summer, who could learn the brief in readiness for confirmation in September.  Edinburgh University\u0026rsquos Professor Lindsay Paterson, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos foremost education experts, said it would be helpful if a new provisional minister was named.  Liam McCabe, president of the National Union of Students, Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoIt is vital that the government priorities appointing a new minister as a matter of urgency."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8004636.jpg?type=article-full","title":"iona-christian-community-in-final-bid-to-save-facilities","story":"              It is described as cradle of Christianity in Scotland.  In 563 AD the Irish monk, St Columba set up a monastic community on the tiny isle of Iona.  Since then it has become a haven for pilgrims, welcoming some 1,500 guests to its Hebridean shores every year.  However recently the fate of the historical abbey precinct has been plunged into doubt after the Christian group based on the island said it has veered dangerously into disrepair.  The Iona Community has said that years of heavy use have taken their toll on the residential facilities at the island\u0027s abbey, with a recent survey revealing that \"without some urgent repairs and long-term major investment, they would be unfit for purpose within seven years\".    It is now launching a final push of its Iona Abbey Capital project to help raise the last \u0026pound500,000 by the end of this year.  On its completion, the project will deliver improved access, new bedrooms and fully accessible shower rooms and toilets, as well as improved insulation and washing facilities at the centrer.  Current \u0026lsquoprivate\u0026rsquo spaces in Iona Abbey will also become accessible to the public as part of the project.  Reverend Kathy Galloway, the joint leader of the Iona Community, said the group had now completed phase one of the works, and now needed more help to fully fund phase two.  She said: \"We want to adapt the living areas to be accessible for wheelchair users and people with mobility issues.  \"We also want to install a renewable energy heating system and winter proof the building so that we can extend our season to welcome more visitors and volunteers each year. At the moment, many rooms are too cold to use past October.\"    Iona Abbey in 1953  Already, \u0026pound3 million has been raised for the project, including \u0026pound300,000 in the month of May alone.  Working in partnership with Historic Environment Scotland and Iona Renewables, it also aims to provide a renewable energy heating system, through a progressive, community-led energy project.  The group said they are now in the position to begin phase two earlier than expected, which will lead to substantial savings, meaning the refurbished project will be ready to open a year early in 2020.  Reverend Galloway said: \"The Iona Community wants to continue to welcome people to share life in community for generations to come, and to make sure we are accessible for all.  \"This complex, exciting project will ensure people from around the world can continue to share in the community\u0026rsquos life within the historic setting and beauty of Iona,\" she said.  In 1938, the Reverend George MacLeod established the Iona Community in the docklands of Govan and on Iona in order to rebuild the monastic quarters of the medieval abbey.  Set in the context of the poverty of the Depression, he brought together unemployed skilled craftsmen and young trainee clergy to serve as a sign of hopeful rebuilding of community in urban Scotland, aiming to rebuild \"the common life by working and living together, sharing skills and effort as well as joys and achievement\".  This has shaped the practice and principles of the group, which acts as an ecumenical Christian community of men and women from different walks of life and different traditions in the Church engaged together.    Outside Iona Abbey in 1953  Since its completion in 1965, the monastery remains a centre for pilgrimage and tourism, with the community now running three residential centres on Iona and the nearby island of Mull.  Now, there is a year-round population of more than 100, including long-established island families as well as more recent arrivals, including those who work for the Iona Community in its centres as staff or volunteers.  Guests come to stay on the island to contemplate and pray, and play a significant role in the island\u0026rsquos economy.  Daily services of the Iona Community are undertaken in the Abbey church, with abbey itself managed by Historic Environment Scotland  Built of stone and slate, the buildings of the Iona Abbey Centre were originally the living quarters of the monks and have retained a distinctly monastic feel.  However, in a report sent to the Church of Scotland\u0026rsquos general assembly two years ago, the Iona Community said that \"piecemeal maintenance and sporadic upgrading of internal services, electrical, water, sewerage and heating have led to constant and uneconomic patchwork repairs.\"  As of this year, both the Abbey Centre and the MacLeod centre -- a newer building on the island, have been closed to residential guests.  Reverend Galloway said the group was hopeful that \"people in Scotland and beyond will recognise the great need to safeguard Iona Abbey as a living place of hospitality, and ensure that thousands more people can visit this special place seeking sanctuary and inspiration\".    The Refectory  In 563AD, the Irish monk Columba (Columkille) established a monastic settlement on the island of Iona, leading to large parts of Scotland and the north of England to become evangelised.  As an important centre of European Christianity, it became the site of a Benedictine abbey in the Middle Ages and for centuries it has attracted thousands of people on their own pilgrim journeys.  The Abbey also has a substantial collection of stone crosses which date back to within 200 years of its founding, some of which show Celtic influences thought to come from Ireland.  The carved stones include St John\u0027s Cross and St Oran\u0027s Cross, and a cross slab created 100 years later.  The crosses are thought to be among the finest examples of such sculpture to survive.  Others bear the stamp of the Vikings who first raided Iona in 794 AD."},{"url":null,"title":"learner-drivers-should-have-to-spot-potholes-to-pass-test","story":"              Learner drivers should have to prove they can spot potholes to pass the test, according to a motoring firm.  The AA wants poor road surfaces to be included in the hazard perception test because of the damage they cause to vehicles.  It also called for advice on what to do when drivers encounter a pothole to be added to the Highway Code.  One in five local roads in England and Wales is in a poor condition as councils face a huge funding deficit to tackle potholes, a recent report by the Asphalt Industry Alliance warned.  Hazard perception is part of the theory driving test and involves candidates identifying something that would cause them to take action such as slow down or change direction in 14 video clips.  The pass rate of the practical driving test fell to a nine-year low of 45% after changes to make the exam more realistic were introduced in December last year.  The AA advises motorists who spot a pothole to:  - Slow down if necessary but keep an eye on the rear view mirror  - Stay in lane  - Avoid big swerves  A survey of a small sample of driving instructors found that the majority have broken down during a lesson at least once in the past 12 months because of pothole-related damage, and many have to adapt lessons to avoid certain roads where there are too many potholes.  Some learners have even had to abandon a practical driving test because their car was damaged by a pothole, the AA was told.  Damage to tyres, wheels and suspension are the most common problems.  AA president Edmund King said: \"It is a sad indictment of our poor road conditions that instructors are having to adapt their lessons to avoid potholed roads.  \"More troubling is the fact that lessons and tests are being abandoned because of pothole related breakdowns.  \"This is damaging to learners\u0027 confidence and to instructors whose livelihoods depend on having a fit-for-purpose road network and an undamaged car.  \"The situation is so serious that the hazard perception test and Highway Code need to change to reflect the state of the roads that learner drivers have to learn on.  \"There is no advice for drivers about potholes anywhere in the Highway Code yet it is one of the most common hazards they encounter.\"  Drivers are being urged to photograph potholes and send them to the responsible highway authority and the Department for Transport to demonstrate the scale of the issue as part of the AA\u0027s #FlagitFunditFillit campaign.  The Government said the DVSA keeps the driving test under constant review to make it as effective as possible.  It said in a statement: \"We have listened to the concerns of road users and are already providing councils in England with over \u0026pound6 billion to help improve the condition of our local highways.  \"This funding includes a record \u0026pound296 million through the Pothole Action Fund - enough to fix around six million potholes.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-business-secretary-hints-brexit-transition-period-could-be-extended-beyond-2020","story":"              THE Business Secretary has added to the tensions inside Theresa May\u0026rsquos divided cabinet by suggesting the post-Brexit transition may have to be extended.  Greg Clark said the status-quo period, which is due to end in December 2020, some 21 months after the UK formally leaves the EU, should be set by \u0026ldquofacts and evidence.  He suggested new computer systems and other border controls might not be ready by 2020.  On Ridge on Sunday on Sky News, Mr Clark, who has said practical business concerns must come before ideology on Brexit, refused to rule out an extension.  He said: \"At all times we need to be guided by the evidence on this. Speaking to the people that run [the port of Dover and Eurotunnel]... there are things that would need to be put in place, computer systems for example posts at the border, even if they checked, automatically number plates.  \"What we need assess is how long it would reasonably take to put in practice. It seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence.  His comments were echoed by Andrea Leadsom, who said 2020 was \u0026ldquonot a magical date.  The leader of the Commons said 2020 \u0026ldquoshould be long enough but \u0026ldquoremains under review.  She told told HuffPost UK: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos been agreed is the end of December 2020. And it\u0026rsquos not a magical figure, a magical date. It\u0026rsquos just what has been agreed with the EU.  \u0026ldquoI personally think it should be long enough. That\u0026rsquos my view. It\u0026rsquos fine as it is. We don\u0026rsquot need for any particular reason to extend it.  \u0026ldquoBut I think it remains under review. As all sides make very clear, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  The idea of extending the period the UK in which maintains much of its relationship with the EU, while losing influence in Brussels, is an incendiary one for Brexiters, who fear it would postpone new trade deals and prolong freedom of movement, creating \u0026lsquoBrino\u0026rsquo, or Brexit in name only.  It is also likely to worsen the break-down in cabinet discipline ahead of this Friday\u0026rsquos crunch meeting at Chequers, where Mrs May hopes to finalise the UK blueprint for Brexit.  Brexiteers oppose the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos favoured option of a customs partnership with the EU, which would see the UK collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods entering the country on behalf of the bloc.  However both options have been dismissed by the EU.  It emerged at the weekend that Brexiter Environment Secretary Michael Gove had physically ripped up an official report suggesting he had come round to the customers partnership plan.  Asked if the customs partnership option was still on the table, Mr Clark said: \"Yes.\"  The chair of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, Sir Graham Brady, publicly pleaded for government unity.  Writing in the Observer, he said his party risked looking divided and letting in Labour.  He said: \u0026ldquoElectorates these days are volatile, but one thing is certain: they do not vote for divided parties. They rejected decisively the divided Tory party in 1997.  \u0026ldquoIf we were to let Labour in again, it would be a disaster for this country.  Damian Green, Mrs May\u0026rsquos former deputy, also attacked the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos fractious cabinet.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have seen threats against her, attacks on business, and cabinet ministers taking the proverbial out of each other\u0026rsquos policies. All of this in full public gaze. It has been an unedifying spectacle of oversized egos showing they are not fit to be officers.  Housing minister James Brokenshire admitted there were \u0026ldquostrong views on either side of the cabinet over Brexit, but he remained confident the Friday meeting at Chequers would end with a \u0026ldquoclear direction and a white paper published the week after.  There are now effectively only six weeks of negotiating time before the UK is supposed to agree a final deal on trade and other aspects of Brexit with the other 27 EU countries.

Festival organisers DF Concerts and Events said music fans enjoyed \u0026ldquounbelievable festival weather, while director Geoff Ellis added that he \u0026ldquocouldn\u0026rsquot have asked for better on our first weekend of TRNSMT.  Temperatures reached over 25C yesterday as Arctic Monkeys headlined at their only UK festival appearance this year, while fans also enjoyed performances by Fatherson, Blossoms and Interpol.    Police said the behaviour of festival-goers had been overwhelmingly positive, however, the warm temperatures kept staff at the on-site hospital busy, with more than 700 people receiving treatment for weather-related, minor ailments.  Alan McWilliam, on-site medical manager, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been a busy event for us, but our team have coped incredibly well and our on-site hospital has offered a first-class service to festival-goers.  \u0026ldquoSo far, we\u0026rsquove seen 710 people across the festival, mainly for minor ailments and weather-related assistance.  \u0026ldquoAll in all, there\u0026rsquos been a positive atmosphere on-site.  Elsewhere in Glasgow, another festival \u0026ndash Fiesta X FOLD, in Kelvingrove Park \u0026ndash saw performances from Nile Rodgers, Emeli Sande, the Pointer Sisters and Goldfrapp over Saturday and yesterday.  Music fans at both sites had been warned to wear sun cream and drink plenty of water to combat the hot weather and ensure they enjoyed the performances. TRNSMT will return next weekend with sets from The Killers, Chvrches, Franz Ferdinand and Texas \u0026ndash and forecasters predict that the warm weather will hold until then.  The Met Office has said sun-worshippers can expect today to remain fine and dry, with temperatures reaching 24C, while the rest of the week will also bring more warm sunshine across Scotland, albeit with some cloud cover at times.  Going into next weekend, the country is expected to continue to enjoy \u0026ldquoabove average temperatures, although there is a risk of some rain in the far north and north-west.  A Met Office spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoFor the second half of July, the most likely scenario is that the fine weather looks set to predominate across the UK, with mostly dry, sunny and warm conditions."},{"url":null,"title":"elvis-has-left-the-vet-school","story":"              AN exotic bird who almost died after swallowing a metal screw is back on her feet thanks to cutting-edge hospital equipment and quick-thinking vets.  The red-legged seriema - named Elvis - was rushed to a specialist facility after her keepers at Blair Drummond Safari Park noticed that she was unusually quiet and struggling to eat.  A CT scan at the University of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies revealed the screw in her stomach and vets quickly removed it with the help of a miniature camera.  Vet Dr Bronwyn Koterwas, of the Exotic Animal and Wildlife Medicine and Surgery service at the university, said: \u0026ldquoElvis was very poorly when she came to us.  \u0026ldquoThanks to our advanced scanning equipment and dedicated team of experts working across departments we were able to rapidly spot what was wrong.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted that Elvis has left the building and has returned safely to Blair Drummond.  Red-legged seriemas are native to South America and stand around a metre tall, thanks to their distinctive spindly legs.  The birds are very inquisitive and often peck at foreign objects, which can prove harmful to their health.  In Elvis\u0026rsquo case, her keepers quickly realised that she as in trouble and called in expert help from the university straight away.  Working quickly, they tested the bird\u0026rsquos blood and referred her for a high-powered CT scan.  The screw was removed without the need for invasive surgery and Elvis was able to return to Blair Drummond the day after she was admitted and is now doing well.  Sheila Walker, Animal Collection Manager at Blair Drummond, said: \u0026ldquoIt is imperative that when any of our animals are sick that they are seen by vets with expertise and the experience necessary to treat the species and we are very fortunate that the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies is only a short drive away.  \u0026ldquoElvis does a short walk from her aviary to the presentation ground and we think that is where she possibly picked up the screw.  \u0026ldquoOur keepers now do a quick sweep of the track before bringing her out."},{"url":null,"title":"italian-league-leader-eu-election-to-be-referendum-on-migration","story":"              The leader of the right-wing party in Italy\u0026rsquos populist government has told tens of thousands of supporters he wants to turn next year\u0026rsquos European Parliament election into a referendum on immigration and job security.  Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini also told his League party\u0026rsquos annual gathering of a vision of uniting the political movements in several European countries which say they want to prevent national interests from being eclipsed by European Union agendas.  Mr Salvini said at the event held in sweltering heat in Pontida, northern Italy: \u0026ldquoI am thinking of a League of Leagues that will put together all the free, sovereign movements.  The League leader enjoys a rapport with French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and former Ukip leader Nigel Farage.  He said the 2019 election for the EU\u0026rsquos legislature should be tantamount to a \u0026ldquoreferendum between the elite, the banks, finance, immigration and job security and the Europe of the peoples and of work.  The League has long railed against EU strictures on national spending and has expressed scepticism about whether it is worth it for Italy to remain in the eurozone.  \u0026ldquoThe happiness of the people comes first, Mr Salvini proclaimed, drawing rousing cheers from League rank-and-file.  He asked supporters if they would \u0026ldquoswear, yes or no, to liberate the people from this Europe.  \u0026ldquoYes, came the resounding reply from the crowd.  Since taking office in Italy\u0026rsquos month-old coalition government, Mr Salvini has made good on a campaign pledge to crack down on humanitarian groups that rescue migrants from smugglers\u0026rsquo boats in the Mediterranean Sea and then ferry the asylum-seekers to Italian ports.  Several hundred thousand rescued passengers, many of them economic migrants ineligible for asylum, have flooded Italy in the last few years.  Mr Salvini announced on Saturday that Italy is refusing to allow a rescue ship to dock in an Italian port, the third such denial in three weeks.  Spain stepped in to offer safe harbour, and the vessel operated by Spanish aid group Proactiva Open Arms is headed to Barcelona.  Mr Salvini told the rally: \u0026ldquoToday, there\u0026rsquos a third ship that will head to another country, and there will also be a fourth and a fifth and so on.  He reiterated his stance that \u0026ldquothe doors of Italy will be wide open for women and children who flee war, but \u0026ldquofor the others, no.  The League is junior partner in the coalition government with the anti-EU 5-Star Movement. In the weeks since, League candidates have triumphed in a series of mayoral elections, sometimes at the expense of the 5-Stars.  A survey of eligible voters published in Saturday\u0026rsquos Corriere della Sera newspaper found support for the League polling at 31.2%, compared to the Movement\u0026rsquos 29.8%.  A prominent 5-Star figure, Roberto Fico, who is president of the Italian parliament\u0026rsquos lower Chamber, has opposed Mr Salvini\u0026rsquos policy of denying safe harbour to humanitarian rescue boats.  Mr Salvini said that was Mr Fico\u0026rsquos personal opinion. Similarly dismissing any talk of a coalition rift was 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio, who, like Mr Salvini, serves as deputy premier.  The League has been transformed from from a north-based regional movement into a national force, attracting anti-migrant voters in the south, a region the party once denigrated as an unproductive drain on national coffers."},{"url":null,"title":"cheryl-and-liam-payne-announce-split","story":"              Cheryl and Liam Payne have split up after a two-and-a-half-year relationship.

AllBright \u0026ndash an initiative that offers funding, training and members clubs to female business owners \u0026ndash has joined the social network\u0026rsquos #SheMeansBusiness programme.  The scheme was launched in 2016 with the aim of helping more women to pursue their business ideas and has already been used by 13,000 women in the UK.  Facebook\u0026rsquos EMEA vice president Nicola Mendelsohn said expanding the programme was vital, not only for women looking to get into business but also for strengthening the economy.  \u0026ldquoSmall businesses are at the heart of our communities and are the backbone of our economy, employing more than 60% of the private sector workforce in the UK.  \u0026ldquoIn fact, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) ranks the UK third in the world for start-ups, she said.  \u0026ldquoBut we know it\u0026rsquos not a level playing field, with UK men twice as likely as women to become a founder. #SheMeansBusiness was originally conceived to help rebalance this, and as we\u0026rsquove supported 13,000 UK women through the programme, we know the next step is to help these startups grow and expand their networks.  \u0026ldquoGrowing a business is tough, but it\u0026rsquos particularly tough for female business leaders. Being part of a business community, and having ongoing support to make progress on self-development, can make all the difference.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos why we\u0026rsquore thrilled to welcome AllBright into the #SheMeansBusiness partner network, to help expand the reach of its free digital learning programme \u0026ndash The AllBright Academy.

Facebook says new research it commissioned found that female founders who were part of a business community were twice as likely to forecast growth than those who were not, however, 50% of those surveyed said they were not part of such a network.  AllBright co-founder Debbie Wosskow said: \u0026ldquoNetworks matter, and having groups of peers that can be called upon to collaborate and learn from when you\u0026rsquore facing a business challenge can help enormously.  \u0026ldquoAllBright is on a mission to make the UK the best place to be a woman in work and as part of this The AllBright Academy programme will complement and expand the support currently offered by #SheMeansBusiness by arming women with the essential skills they need to tackle topics like confidence and resilience, as well as cash flow and hiring a team.  \u0026ldquoBut importantly, it will also encourage participants to meet up and discuss the course topics, support each other to achieve their ambitions and further expand their networks."},{"url":null,"title":"ken-smiths-diary-handless-driver-chips-are-down-foul-language","story":"              Handless driver  OUR introspective taxi driver story reminded Derek Miller in Torrance: \"Years ago, having attended a black tie dinner at Glasgow\u0027s Crowne Plaza, Glasgow, I emerged, fully refreshed, and into the waiting cab.

Immature eggs have been shown for the first time in a laboratory to survive on ovarian tissue which was removed from cancer patients before treatment and stripped of cells, researchers said.  It is hoped this engineered structure could be re-implanted into women and restore fertility after they have completed chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  Scientists from the Rigshospitalet, in Copenhagen, Denmark, proved the graft worked when using human tissue transplanted into mice.  Experts said the research, presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) annual meeting in Barcelona, \u0026ldquoholds much promise for the future.  Many cancer treatments can damage the ovaries, stopping the body from producing eggs and meaning a woman cannot get pregnant. Women dealing with a diagnosis can choose to have their eggs frozen, while some doctors may offer to remove or freeze all or part of an ovary so it can be transplanted back after treatment.  However, there is a small chance that grafted ovarian tissue could reintroduce cancer cells.  A \u0026ldquobio-engineered ovary would reduce this risk, the research team from Rigshospitalet said.  Their experiments used ovarian tissue removed from women trying to preserve their fertility before cancer treatment. The cells from the tissue were eliminated using chemicals, leaving behind a \u0026ldquobio-engineered scaffold on which the early-stage egg-containing follicles were reseeded.  Dr Susanne Pors, who presented the research, said: \u0026ldquoThis is the first time that isolated human follicles have survived in a decellularised human scaffold and, as a proof-of-concept, it could offer a new strategy in fertility preservation without risk of malignant cell recurrence.  Experiments in which the structure was transplanted into mice showed it could support the survival and growth of the follicles.  Commenting on the research, Professor Nick Macklon, medical director at London Women\u0026rsquos Clinic, said it was an \u0026ldquoexciting development.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove been able to show that they can then introduce back into that tissue stored follicles and early-growth eggs, that then appear to grow in that material that\u0026rsquos had all the cells removed, he said.  \u0026ldquoAnd, that this can then be placed back into the body and hopefully allow women to re-establish their cycles to possibly conceive, either naturally or with IVF, while reducing this risk of cancer.  He said the technique was \u0026ldquolikely to develop into something that will be potentially useful, but said further research was needed to prove it will work in humans.  Stuart Lavery, consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital, said \u0026ldquoIf this is shown to be effective, it offers huge advantages over IVF and egg freezing."},{"url":null,"title":"loki-and-heseltine-to-headline-festival-of-politics","story":"              THE rapper Loki is to appear at this year\u0026rsquos Festival of Politics at the Scottish Parliament.

Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.

Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

The crew also carried out maintenance work on lights and lanterns.As time went by the vessel was employed in the conversion of automated lighthouses to solar panel operation. When this work was completed in 1996, the ship was taken out of service.An initiative was later launched to preserve the vessel as a floating cultural monument.This ship is representative of a type of specialised vessel from a unique period in the history of Norwegian lighthouses and is open to the public today, Wednesday, afternoon 2pm-6pm, the again from 10am-Noon and 2pm \u0026#8211 6pm on Thursday.More details about the visit of the ship in The Orcadian next week.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is simply not acceptable.Whatever the outstanding disagreement there may be between the government and commercial operators, Mr McArthur feels that people in Orkney have every right to expect both sides to get this sorted without delay.\u0026#8220The Transport Secretary also needs to confirm that the fare reductions, once agreed, will be backdated to 30 June, in keeping with the firm promises made by his predecessor and the First Minister,\u0026#8221 he said.“This sorry saga has rumbled on for far too long. It is time for people in Orkney to get a fair crack of the whip when it comes to RET”.More updates to follow.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions. Chairman Ian Blake of Aultgrishan said it was an exciting setting for competitors and \"will provide visitors to the gardens with a unique opportunity to hear some of the most gifted young inheritors of our much cherished Highland heritage\". Entries are now open in a variety of classes.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Monday 2 Jul 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Most damaging of all, Loganair noted, was the announcement by Flybe that it was entering a new franchise agreement with Eastern Airways and would compete head-to-head on six routes.            Despite the turbulence, Loganair booked record turnover of £110.7m, a rise of 7 per cent. Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762286.1530442869!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures liam gallagher closes day 2 of trnsmt festival","story":"\t\tTens of thousands of music lovers once again flocked to a sold out Glasgow Green for day two of Scotland\u0026#8217s biggest music festival, and as TRNSMT fans bathed in glorious temperatures - with Glasgow reaching higher temperatures than Madrid \u0026#8211 acts like Gerry Cinnamon, Kyle Falconer, Courteeners and Krept and Konan took to the stage.\t\t\t\t• VIEW THE FULL GALLERY HERE            Kicking things off on the Main Stage were Glasgow’s very own The LaFontaines with frontman Kerr Okan delighting the crowd as the band made their second consecutive appearance at the festival.            Addressing the audience, Kerr Okan, said: “Glasgow you look so good in the sunshine! Thanks for watching us, you are part of this band!”Shed Seven followed with hits including ‘Disco Down’ and ‘Going for Gold’ as well as a cover of Stone Roses ‘I Am the Resurrection’ Krept x Konan, the London-based hip-hop duo who have seen a gradual rise to prominence over the last few years, took to the stage before the arrival  of possibly the most anticipated performance of TRNSMT’s first weekend - Gerry Cinnamon’s Main Stage set. Just one year ago the local star took to the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage, now a year later thousands of fans displayed their adoration for the one man show with just an acoustic guitar the singer-songwriter from Castlemilk once again had the crowd eating out of his hands.             Fans over on the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage were also treated to a strong line-up of both promising and established acts throughout the day, including openers The Night Café, BAS, The Academic, Scottish natives The Snuts and Kyle Falconer, who provided an insight into his upcoming solo album. Ramz and IAMDDB continued the party into the early evening, before The Sherlocks closed proceedings with their straight-down-the-line indie sound.As the evening rocked on, Wolf Alice’s performed hits such as ‘Silk’ and newer material including ‘Don’t Delete the Kisses’, before the Courteeners took the Main Stage.Ten years on from the release of their, now iconic, debut album St Jude, Courteeners wowed their fans with tunes like ‘Not Nineteen Forever’, ‘Notion’ and ‘Cavorting’.            Headline act Liam Gallagher then arrived stating: “So this is the famous Glasgow Green then? I’ve heard a lot about it.” The former Oasis frontman’s performance then documented his 25-year career as one of the country’s most popular figures, with solo tunes such as ‘Wall of Glass’ and ‘Greedy Soul’ tucked between Oasis classics such as ‘Morning Glory’ and ‘Wonderwall’.Geoff Ellis, Festival Director said: “Today has had so many highlights from the mass Shed Seven singalong to the absolute class of Liam Gallagher’s set. One of the biggest moments for me was watching local boy Gerry Cinnamon completely command the Main Stage in front of his biggest ever crowd.

I am a unionist with a lower case \u0026#8220u\u0026#8221. \t\t\t\tBy that I mean I am not committed to any one unionist party and am willing to give non-unionist parties a fair hearing if they apply liberal, low tax, small government policies in Scotland, because I believe these are what will most likely deliver as harmonious and prosperous a Scotland for the vast majority of its people as is practicably possible.            Nor do I support unionism because I think an independent Scotland could not succeed one just has to look at other smaller countries to see that if Denmark or Norway can do well then surely so could Scotland – if it lived within its means.            No, I am unionist because I am at home with being Scottish and British. It was in my mother’s milk that I suckled on it was in my rearing through infancy and schooldays and my travelling around the UK as a youth and then an undergraduate. I have rejoiced in our rich and diverse cultural history during my British holidays, just as I enjoy the internal home nations’ rivalries or competition between Scotland’s cities or the Highlands and Lowlands. I can see the good in them and the faults in them, but I do see and feel a tangible unifying oneness, a bond that I cannot let go of.So when I see the bitter divisions that came out of the first independence referendum – the splitting of families, the loss of friends and the rising tide of implied or discreet threats, sometimes with genuine menace – then I fear what another independence referendum could do to our country. At the age of 60 this year, I do not think the psychological wounds of 2014 will be healed before I leave this Earth – were there to be a second referendum then I have absolutely no doubt it will be ugly and the scarring divisions that much greater. Yet I have to tell you I also believe there will be another and it will not be pretty, and whatever the outcome it will need real leadership to bring about a healing. Sadly, there are few leaders of any humility or calibre that I think could achieve such a highly desirable role.I believe there will be another independence referendum because all the signs point to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wishing and now needing it to be so, and for good or ill she will instigate it. The original SNP strategy was that if, when in government, it could show a SNP-run Scotland was no worse or maybe even slightly better than the Labour-Liberal Democrat administrations before, then independence might not seem such an undesirable leap. On many issues this meant the SNP actually did very little it promised for instance, the council tax was not abolished in favour of a local income tax, nor were students loans written off.            When in 2011 the SNP won its overall majority it still did not seek to frighten the horses for fear of losing potential supporters for independence. Other than centralising institutions (under the mistaken guise of saving money), public service reform was studiously avoided. Scotland was in stasis while the independence White Paper, Scotland’s Future, was published, and following the 55-45 defeat no ­serious public service reform has followed.The SNP is essentially averse to challenging the vested interests in health and education, for to do so must force some people to be against them when they need to build a coalition for Yes (or more likely “Leave”) the second time round.After 11 years of SNP government we are therefore at a point where, under its watch, education is much worse with falling numeracy and literacy and collapsing international rankings expose the truth of this the Scottish NHS too is failing with the worst cancer treatment times in history and four health boards now requiring emergency loans totalling over £70 million just to get by meanwhile the iconic Queensferry Crossing yet again requires further remedial work that will disrupt traffic all summer and our public roads now have more craters than the surface of the Moon. These are just some examples, for when you turn over any Scottish Government stone the problems come crawling out like clipshears and wood lice.            Last week Sturgeon had a shambolic ministerial reshuffle that was bad on two counts. Firstly, she appointed a narcissist tweeter with a criminal conviction as Justice Secretary, when the role requires a solemn and judicious politician with a character, like Caesar’s wife, that is beyond suspicion. Secondly she not only retained her financial secretary, Derek Mackay, who has presided over a growing black hole that no quantum physicist can explain, she actually added to his brief. Ultimately this void will swallow up her government. Then she retained her Education Secretary, John Swinney, when by the evidence of his own inactions he has utterly failed to deliver the necessary reforms for what is claimed to be her “number one priority” of schooling.That was before the wheels came of the reshuffle tea trolley with the withdrawal of Gillian Martin as education minister. The strategy for a second independence referendum was originally to use any and every grievance with Westminster – and where none existed, to create some – so momentum for a referendum could then be held. That is clearly not working. Nor by 20,000 leagues is the original model of demonstrating competence.            All that is now left is for Sturgeon to take us into a second referendum – with or without Westminster’s necessary legal consent – so she can polarise the country and thus galvanise personal support to have any chance of the SNP remaining the largest party after the next Holyrood elections in 2021.Glorious victory – or more likely, glorious defeat whatever the cost to Scotland – is worth it if it means remaining in control of government. No longer is a second referendum about winning independence, it is about retaining power. Scotland will be thrown to the wolves to whip up division so in the aftermath disappointed supporters will flock to the SNP. Sturgeon cares not for the country’s harmony, prosperity or public services – she cares only for the SNP being in position to have a third tilt at independence.Such is the sorry state of our nation. I hope and pray I am wrong.l Brian Monteith is editor of ThinkScotland.org"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762404.1530479246!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch snp need to solve highlands housing shortage","story":"\t\tThis summer will be one of the best ever for Scotland\u0026#8217s tourist industry. The weakness of the pre-Brexit pound, the trend for staycationing, the discovery of home-grown treasures like the North Coast 500 and weeks of heatwave weather mean foreign and English tourists have been joined by Scots deciding to holiday at home.    \t\t\t\tBut while tourism will undoubtedly hit new heights in 2018, it may also finally expose the housing crisis in remote and rural Scotland, which affects every facet of life and means locals cannot benefit as they should from this seasonal windfall.            Alison Macleod has been community development officer on the Applecross Peninsula for seven years. She and her fisherman husband Alasdair had lived there for 35 years until his tragic death late last year. Now, for lots of reasons, she plans to leave. Obviously, there are personal issues. But there’s also the fact that for long wearying decades the tiny community has been banging its collective head off the brick wall of the Applecross Trust – the landowner which owns most of the 60,000 acres on the peninsula.             Despite a succession of schemes, pleas and campaigns, next to no land has been made available for any kind of community development, including affordable houses. The cost of accommodation has risen rapidly over the last 15 years because of scarcity and the demand for holiday houses. Local people – often dependent on seasonal tourism-related jobs – struggle to get mortgages and cannot compete. Without houses, busy local businesses struggle to recruit and retain staff. Anyone who wants to live on the peninsula must live in a caravan all year round or in shared hotel staff accommodation.  The situation is hardly any better than when Alison took up the job. Despite the vast emptiness of Applecross, there is no land for housing. It’s a disgrace. Thanks to a herculean effort, the community energy scheme, Apple Juice, did squeak home just before the UK government cut meaningful subsidies. At least that will attract a worthwhile income to the community – over time. But right now, tourism is placing an extra burden on the doughty DIY community. Instead of devoting all their energies to finding the land to build affordable homes, the volunteers who staff the Applecross Community Company must spend their precious time catering for the near-constant avalanche of tourists. Effectively, the community of 200 people must clean, maintain and run toilet facilities, also used by dozens of camper vans and caravans to empty waste. Highland Council has withdrawn most of the cash for toilet facilities and there is no properly organised place to dispose of caravan waste locally. Alison says: “Our local tourist businesses will always welcome visitors to Applecross and make sure they enjoy their time here. We know our local economy is dependent on tourism but our infrastructure needs a lot of investment to cope and we cannot be expected to do it all ourselves. The powers that be expect volunteers to put in an enormous amount of time and effort to ensure communities are sustainable, but there is a limit to what can be done voluntarily with fewer than 200 adults, no matter how able and determined. The result is volunteer burnout and disillusion, not community empowerment.”Now this may be where the urban majority shrugs, turns over the page or tunes out. I’ve no doubt that, from a city perspective, country folk seem stubbornly unwilling to recognise the facts of life. Of course housing, roads, broadband and basic facilities are poor in the Highlands – that’s what happens when you don’t live in a city. On Radio Scotland last week, a report about the NHS at 70 highlighted the drastic shortage of doctors, nurses, surgeons and GPs in rural Scotland. The reporter suggested this was inevitable because young people wanting to specialise don’t have a large or wide enough caseload in small towns or rural areas. That may be a problem for some. But for many NHS staff, keen to live a more sustainable life in beautiful surroundings, the problem is far simpler: no housing, no land for housing and no expectation that modest housing schemes will get through planning. It’s the same story across the Highlands. Rural Scotland is not a basket case destined for unavoidable decline. But resourceful Highland, island and rural folk have their hands tied behind their backs when it comes to building the infrastructure that supports life.             According to Argyll builder and former MSP Mike Mackenzie: “There are struggling farmers and crofters aplenty who would happily turn a corner of a field into a high-quality camper van site. Visual impact might be easily mitigated by dry stane dykes and a few native trees. Decent laybys at appropriate intervals could relieve many of the road problems without turning single-track roads into motorways. With less than 2 per cent of the Highlands under development, we have land aplenty. The reluctance embodied in the planning system to use this resource is simply perverse.”The Highlands’ chronic housing shortage is also making schools become unviable – in Argyll and Bute, the 26 village and island schools saved ten years ago may soon close because of falling rolls. Local youngsters, about to start families, are the most desperate. Four years ago a group of young adults  in Aviemore planned to club together, buy a field and hope they would win planning permission to build houses co-operatively using sweat labour to make it affordable. But despite expert help, nothing happened and most have left the area and some even the country. This haemorrhaging has to stop.  What’s the big problem? Some suggest housing associations seek economies of scale and opt to build blocks of 50 houses in urban areas rather than five to ten houses in rural areas. Others suggest the process is bureaucratic, cumbersome and so slow that the demand for housing has generally fled long before the houses are ready. Community houses built near Ulva took almost ten years to complete. There are very few people who can maintain their energy, enthusiasm and patience over this kind of timescale. Funding evaporates and any vestige of entrepreneurial spirit withers away.            The situation demands urgent action – the Planning Bill currently before Holyrood offers a vehicle for bold solutions. Let’s not continue the pretence one summer longer. Extra tourists alone cannot save rural Scotland.

But an MSP wants Souness, 65, to abandon the multi-­million-pound project after the company submitted plans to build 2,600 homes on the sprawling site.            In a letter to the former Ibrox boss, Scottish Conservative MSP Graham Simpson said: “I urge you to reconsider destroying this protected piece of green space.”Campaign group Save Woodhall and Faskine said the development will ruin “irreplaceable” countryside, harm wildlife and cause pollution.But Mr Simpson also believes preserving the site is important for the health of local residents.In his letter to Souness, Mr Simpson adds: “You will be aware of the site and its importance both environmentally and culturally.“What you may not be so aware of is its significance to the local community and their health and wellbeing.            “However, as a former sportsman I am certain that people’s physical and mental health are at the forefront of your thoughts.“Scottish Government figures show that in 2016, 65 per cent of adults over the age of 16 were overweight and 29 per cent were obese. “I am sure you would agree that these are shocking statistics.

The company previously received a loan from a company owned by Scotland’s richest woman Ann Gloag. The land is owned by two daughters of former Conservative home secretary Willie Whitelaw.The plans also include shops, educational and leisure facilities, restaurants, a pub, a garden centre and a hotel.A 3,000-signature petition opposing development was presented to Holyrood in March when Mr Simpson led a debate calling for the greenbelt to be saved.

Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more seabirds entangled but fishing industry not always to blame says tour guide ","story":"\nDarron Smith cuts free a gannet.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.

We never made it higher than 14 though.\u0026#8221\nAsked if they expected to win the return leg as well he appeared reasonably confident.\n\u0026#8220We are supposed to have the quickest boat so we have to be first back again.\u0026#8221\n\nThe Mareel event began with a welcome from SIC convener Malcolm Bell, who thanked all the visiting sailors for coming to Shetland.\nThe Viking Race, which takes in Faroe and Iceland, is also part of the overall competition this year and Mr Bell could not resist a dig in relation to the former island group.\n, flagship of the Smyril Line which the council invested millions in, no longer called here.\n\u0026#8220Connections with Norway are something we take very, very seriously indeed,\u0026#8221 Mr Bell said, urging the competitors to visit the Lerwick Town Hall if they got a chance.\n\u0026#8220The stained glass windows are looking particularly brilliant in the summer sunshine,\u0026#8221 he said. \u0026#8220I would like to say the weather we have enjoyed these last few days is normal, but as many of you have been here before you would know that I would be lying.\u0026#8221\nLerwick Port Authority chairman Ronnie Gair presents Morten Offendal (left) and Espen Børresen with their award.

The skipper handled the situation extremely well.”\nThe 40-year-old converted fishing boat, with an all-female crew and female passengers, was heading to Shetland for a diving trip, and will be in the isles for the next few weeks.\n since January last year and has 22 years experience as a power boat instructor, said she called the coastguard as a precaution.\n was [originally] a fishing boat and well able for the conditions.”\nThe problem started when the boat began taking in water from the rudder gland and a deck hatch, she said. The boat was equipped with a three bilge-pump system but one of the pumps had failed, meaning they only had one as back-up. Ms Weaver said: “We try to be two failures away from a problem.” Also, she said, she had to “err on the side of caution” because the boat was carrying 12 passengers.\n was able to proceed “under her own power and pumping under her own power” into Lerwick. She is currently in the small boat harbour.\n and two sunken klondykers.\n is used for various types of dive trips, including recreational and wreck diving in locations in Orkney and Shetland, including Scapa Flow and Fair Isle as well as in northern Scotland and Faroe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]
