A daughter was born, followed by a son.When war broke out in Europe in 1914, he could have stayed out of it, and did for a while, safely working for the British Ministry of Information in the U.S. But, as the fighting intensified, he felt unable to ignore the call of duty. In 1916, he returned to the UK and joined up.All too soon he was in Belgium enduring the misery of the front line with his regiment, the Irish Guards, and sending home to his children those letters conjuring up Dolittle’s funny little world of peace and harmony.Before dispatching them, he would try out drafts of his stories on his own troops, reading them out by candlelight during the dark nights. These battle-hardened soldiers listened, hushed and entranced, to Dolittle’s adventures, for a brief moment taken away from the death and destruction all around.In those trenches, Lofting survived longer than most young subalterns, despite his habit of sleeping out in the open rather than underground in a fetid bunker. Eventually his good fortune ran out. A piece of shrapnel pierced his thigh and he was invalided out just as the war ended.Back home with his family, his wife Flora recognised that the Dolittle stories could be a goldmine and she badgered him into compiling them as a book. Two years later The Story Of Dr Dolittle was published. The dedication read ‘to all children, children in years and children in heart’. It was an instant success.          Dolittle lived on, in the books and the young readers who continued to lap them up. Until, that is, the 1970s, when suddenly they became forbidden fruitA fellow writer, the novelist Sir Hugh Walpole, hailed Dr Dolittle as a work of genius and ‘the first real children’s classic since Alice In Wonderland’ decades earlier.Lofting had hit the jackpot. Lucrative commissions rolled in for more Dolittle stories — he wrote 12 in all. He had found the success in life he always craved.But beneath the surface, he was a troubled man. The war had left its indelible mark on him, as it did on so many of his generation. It would not let him go. All the horrors he had experienced ate away at his soul. He despaired of humanity. He sank into depression and pessimism. He drank to forget, but couldn’t.The alcohol took over, turning this once mild-mannered man into a cantankerous and even violent one on occasions.There was no respite for him as his woes piled up. In 1927, Flora died, after battling mental illness, and Lofting was widowed. Not longer afterwards, he met vivacious Katherine Harrower-Peters and they married after a whirlwind romance. Two weeks later, she, too, was dead, from pneumonia caught on their honeymoon. He lapsed deeper into depression, becoming bullying and ever more difficult — the complete antithesis of the gentle Dolittle.He also tired of the doctor he’d created and disliked being categorised as a children’s author. He wanted to move on to writing books with a more adult theme, but his army of readers simply wanted more of the same.Things did get better for him. He fell in love again, with Josephine, a nurse who at 24 was half his age. They married in 1935 and a baby boy was born the following year and for a while he was at his happiest, turning out three more Dolittle books.But then war broke out again in Europe in 1939. He was mortified that all the sacrifices of 1914-18 in the so-called ‘war to end all wars’ had been in vain. The drinking intensified, irreparably damaging his liver. He died in 1947, aged 61.But Dolittle lived on, in the books and the young readers who continued to lap them up. Until, that is, the 1970s, when suddenly they became forbidden fruit.Lofting, a product of Victorian imperialism, had written his stories in an age when racist stereotypes and the notion of white supremacy were taken for granted. In Dolittle’s forays to Africa, his attitude to the black inhabitants he met was kindly but condescending and disrespectful, to say the least.He used some language that was commonplace in his era but would be rightly deemed unacceptable decades later. The N-word in particular jarred, and in 1968 — more than 20 years after his death — he was publicly attacked for it.In New York, a librarian by the name of Isabelle Suhl denounced Lofting as a white chauvinist and racist and described his creation, Dolittle as ‘the personification of the Great White Father nobly bearing the white man’s burden’.His books disappeared from library shelves in America. There were no more reprints. Dolittle was effectively banned.It was more than a decade before he was rehabilitated. The text was amended to avoid offence, the ‘blind spots of Lofting’s own era’ (to quote one critic) were expunged, and the books once again published in America.Lofting’s son Christopher approved of the changes, declaring that his father ‘would have been appalled at the suggestion that any part of his work could give offence and would have been the first to have made the changes himself.‘The message he conveyed throughout his work was one of respect for life and the rights of all who share the common destiny of our world.’And any lingering suspicions that racism was deeply embedded in the Dolittle stories must surely have disappeared when black actor Eddie Murphy took the title part in the 1998 film.In terms of plot, Murphy’s version bore little resemblance to Lofting’s, apart from the doctor’s ability to talk to animals. Judging by the trailer, the new film for 2020 sticks much more closely to the original, with travels, adventures and talking animals in abundance.The enduring Dr Dolittle lives on, long in the tooth now after 100 years but, along with Dab-Dab the duck, Gub-Gub the baby pig, Chee-Chee the chimp and all the other chatty animals that Lofting gave voice to, still a treat for a whole new generation to enjoy."},{"url":null,"title":"Home ownership young people rises time ten years","story":"Share this article But he said parents whose children are now aged 35 to 44 would have been hit by the crash just when they might have been looking to do the same.

It was announced earlier this week that it is being investigated for its poor performance on routes used by train operators Northern and TransPennine Express.Rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, said it had put the state-owned firm ‘on a warning’ in relation to its work in the north-west and central region.The ORR said performance deteriorated in 2018, when delayed engineering works contributed substantially to the timetable chaos that led to thousands of Northern services being cancelled or running significantly late. Although the industry vowed to learn their lessons, the regulator said performance had failed to substantially recover during 2019.Of the top 20 people on the list, 12 are from Network Rail and three are from HS2. Others include officials from Highways England, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, the Oil and Gas Authority and the MoD agency Defence, Equipment and Support. Across Whitehall, 18 civil servants are on more than £300,000 – twice the PM’s salary. The huge pay packets across Whitehall cost taxpayers nearly £94.7million – up 6 per cent on £89.3million the year before. The ‘high earners’ total does not cover highly-paid iniduals at local councils or NHS trusts.Last night Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said: ‘We need to attract the brightest and the best to deliver on the peoples’ priorities and save taxpayers’ money. But very high salaries in the public sector must be justified, so it’s right that we publish this information and allow it to be scrutinised.’A spokesman for HS2 Ltd said: ‘In a highly technical project of the scale and complexity of HS2 it is necessary to employ the right level of expertise and knowledge to deliver the programme successfully.’  Fiasco as damning report says: No one knows the final cost of the lineBy TOM PAYNEMinisters have no idea how much HS2 will end up costing, a damning report reveals today.The high-speed rail project is running wildly over budget and will not deliver good value for money, according to a probe by the National Audit Office.The Government spending watchdog says the benefit to the immediate economy will be as low as 80p for every £1 spent on ‘phase one’ from London to Birmingham. This rises to a meagre £1.40 for every £1 invested in the full line connecting the capital to the North.         The high-speed rail project is running wildly over budget and will not deliver good value for money, according to a probe by the National Audit OfficeConstruction work on the project must begin by the end of March if the first phase of HS2 is to open between 2029 and 2033 as planned, the report warns.Even so, full passenger services from Euston to the Midlands might not begin until 2036, ten years later than scheduled –and the full line could take 20 years to finish. So far £7.4billion has been spent without a single piece of track being laid. The Prime Minister and senior ministers will decide within weeks whether to go ahead with the troubled project, scale it back or scrap it entirely. The NAO’s findings will fuel calls for a major rethink of the scheme, the official cost of which could hit £106billion – triple the original £32billion estimate.Investigators also found that the number of HS2 staff has doubled since 2016 to 1,250.In all, HS2’s official cost estimate of £88billion, set by the Department for Transport (DfT) in September last year, is 58 per cent more than the available funding of £55.7billion.         Construction work on the project must begin by the end of March if the first phase of HS2 is to open between 2029 and 2033 as planned, the report warnsThe report says HS2’s early £7billion contingency fund was not enough to cover ‘significant increases in cost’ which emerged as issues came to light.It is impossible to say how much HS2 will cost overall as the second phase of the line, from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds, is at a very early stage, the NAO added. The ‘ambitious’ programme will take decades, the watchdog concluded.‘In not fully and openly recognising the programme’s risks from the outset, the Department and HS2 Ltd have not adequately managed the risks to value for money’, it said.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has commissioned extra data on potential alternatives to HS2 before making a final decision on its future next month.Last night Andy McDonald, Labour transport spokesman, accused the Tories of ‘woeful’ political leadership over HS2. A DfT spokesman said: ‘We recognise that there have been significant underestimations of both the cost and schedule of HS2 in the past which is why we commissioned the Oakervee review to provide advice on whether and how to proceed with HS2.’ "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5ee745deec8e9c73b37cc03519c194e74b31c25/0_0_2456_1635/master/2456.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4b17d967116e457ae2826c777cb4022b 1440w","title":"we women artists photographers critical issues","story":"We, Women seeks to cover critical issues in the US through the lens of women, trans and non-binary photographers.

Who is she, I’m confused” – before clarifying that he was joking.“After she goes and studies economics in college she can come back and explain that to us,” Mnuchin added, at a press conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos.Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and\u0026nbspthe elaborate system of badges\u0026nbspreveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations.For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all\u0026nbspa big waste of time.\u0026nbspThe 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.\u0026nbspThunberg, 17, responded by tweeting a graph from a UN report showing how the world’s remaining carbon budget will be used up by 2027 unless global emissions are curbed.“My gap year ends in August, but it doesn’t take a college degree in economics to realise that our remaining 1,5° carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments don’t add up,” she pointed out.Mnuchin’s comments expose the huge gulf that still exists between climate activists and the White House. Pressed on the climate emergency, Mnuchin insisted that environmental issues are “clearly complicated”.He said: “When I was allowed to drive I had a Tesla. I drove in California. I liked it. “But nobody focuses on how that electricity is made and what happens to the storage and the environmental issues on all these batteries.”He also claimed the US was showing leadership in tackling emissions – but through its private sector rather than government. President Trump believes in clean air and water, and a clean environment, Mnuchin insisted, but also believes that more attention should be paid to the environmental damage caused by China and India.People who call for estment should remember there are “significant economic issues, issues with jobs”, he continued. “Many economies are transitioning to more efficient and cleaner energy. That doesn’t have to be all renewables.”Angela Merkel, though, spoke warmly about the work of the new generation of climate activists.“The impatience of our young people is something that we should tap,” the German chancellor said. In a special address to the WEF, Merkel called for more international cooperation to tackle climate change.“I am totally convinced that the price of inaction will be far higher than the price of action,” she declared.Thunberg has used this week’s gathering in Davos to push for radical change on the climate emergency.She called for an immediate exit from fossil fuel investment, an end to subsidies for the industry and a halt to investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction by companies, banks, institutions and governments.“You might think we’re naive but if you won’t do it, you must explain to your children why you’ve given up on the Paris agreement goals and knowingly created a climate crisis,” she told delegates on Tuesday.Mnuchin’s comments clearly show the White House has yet to heed the call.The US labour secretary, Eugene Scalia, called for a balanced approach. The energy sector has been an important source of jobs and fully esting from fossil fuels would also harm US pensioners, he said.On Tuesday, Trump told Davos that delegates should be optimistic.“To embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse. They are the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4768a2cd9e7a0a4da980ca67c9ec47deaf08f735/0_263_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef08d78edf44af7b7c96985b37ca28a2","title":"treorchy welsh valleys high street year","story":"Treorchy, which boasts a website and arts festival, triumphs over bigger rivalsThe small town of Treorchy in the Welsh valleys has beaten far bigger rivals to be named high street of the year in a nationwide competition.Home to just 6,000 people, Treorchy triumphed at the Great British High Street awards after impressing judges with a welter of community initiatives that had reinvigorated its struggling local economy.“In our area in the valleys of south Wales there is not much industry and times are tough,” said Adrian Emmett, who runs The Lion pub in Treorchy. “But in the face of adversity we have come up with an entrepreneurial model. There are areas that have received a lot more funding than us. This is about self-help.”The Rhondda town boasts a website, arts festival and “hop, shop and save” scheme that trades advertising space on local buses for in-store discounts.Other finalists in the awards, which recognise communities at the forefront of efforts to reinvent their high street, were Grimsby, Swansea and Hitchin.“There have been no big investments,” said Emmett, who described the victory as a town-wide effort. “It is from us pulling ourselves up by ourselves up by our boot straps. It was about getting people to believe we could do it.”The win for Treorchy is a rare good news story as high streets around the country suffer steep decline amid a sea change in shopping habits. Last year they shed more than 140,000jobs as store closures and retail failures made 2019 one of the most challenging years in a generation.Jake Berry, the high streets minister, said town centres and high streets remained the “beating heart” of communities with the awards celebrating the “grit and determination of local people who are dedicated to supporting their communities, growing their local economy and finding innovative solutions to modern day challenges”.Kelso, in the Scottish Borders, won the rising star category after the market town managed to increase the number of shopper visits despite cuts to local services. The town is developing an app to promote local events and businesses.The awards are a partnership with the payments firm Visa, which funds the £15,000 top prize. Its UK and Ireland managing director, Jeni Mundy, said Treorchy and Kelso were examples of communities that had made huge strides to transform their high streets. “Their success goes to show that where you shop really does matter,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/796f27564e5f323eae238ed1c5fe5f019198b84d/0_118_4779_2867/master/4779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93a5564ff393b57a84a23981687ae4b1","title":"unions agree deal to sell british steel to chinese firm jingye","story":"Agreement on terms of employment removes obstacle to sale by end of FebruaryBritish Steel is a step closer to being rescued by Chinese industrial firm Jingye, after a deal was agreed with trade unions wary of the impact on jobs and conditions.Workers’ representatives and executives from the Chinese company, led by former communist party official Li Ganpo, are understood to have shaken hands about steelworkers’ future terms of employment.The government, which has provided an indemnity to fund the operation of a business reportedly losing up to £1m a day, is determined to complete a sale that could save more than 4,000 jobs by the end of February.If a sale is completed close to the deadline, it will have taken more than nine months since British Steel’s collapse into insolvency to find a buyer.Backing from trade unions, first reported by the Financial Times and confirmed by sources close to the discussions, removes one potential obstacle standing in the way.Jingye still needs to reach agreement with suppliers, while the French state has to approve the sale of the company’s plant in Hayange, near the border with Luxembourg. revealed earlier this week that the government has lined up Turkey’s Cengiz Holdings, led by President Erodğan’s ally Mehmet Cengiz, as a potential fallback option.But Jingye remains in pole position after signing a deal late last year to buy the company for about £50m and promising to invest about £1.2bn to restore it to former glories.Despite the pledge, the takeover is expected to result in some redundancies, adding more job cuts to a steel sector already suffering contraction elsewhere.Trade unions will now write to their members and ask whether they are willing to accept the terms on offer from Jingye.A spokesperson for the trade union Community said it could not comment until it has spoken to its members. has approached Jingye for comment.The Official Receiver, a government employee managing the sale in tandem with accountancy firm EY, declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93002356e0ba39043c5c624eac7edf988cabb9d0/0_678_3488_2093/master/3488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57ad993a8d1e84100534c1a666296a30","title":"young mps tuition fees generation parliament free education","story":"Westminster’s newest recruits are now in a position to challenge older MPs who benefited from a free educationIt has taken a surprisingly long time for the chickens to come home to roost. But watching Zarah Sultana, the 26-year-old new Labour MP for Coventry South, waving her student debt bill at ministers over the despatch box last week was a decisive moment in the henhouse all the same. How, she raged, was it fair that working-class kids such as her had ended up £50,000 in debt from going to college, while Boris Johnson sailed straight “from the playing fields of Eton to a free education at Oxford”?To accuse her of class warfare, as several Tories promptly did, is fundamentally missing the point. Age is the yawning ide between newcomers such as Sultana or Nottingham East’s Nadia Whittome – who dropped out of university halfway through because of money worries – and many of the ministers they’re facing across the floor of the Commons. While there’s nothing new in the argument that millennials got a raw deal compared to previous generations, there’s something about the rawness of facing that concept made flesh that shifts the terms of debate.Here come the furious children of the Cameron years, now finally old enough to make it to Westminster. The new intake includes a handful of the first generation to have their formative years shaped by his government, boomeranging back into the heart of the institution where harsh choices were made, including the tripling of tuition fees. They have very little power to change anything still, since the scale of Labour’s defeat at the last election means they lack the parliamentary numbers or the winning mandate. But these ghosts of decisions past are proving rather good at rattling their chains.Scrapping tuition fees for everyone, as Sultana seems to want, remains a poor way of helping more working-class kids go to university it overwhelmingly benefits the middle-class families whose children still dominate higher education, and doesn’t tackle the deeper rooted reasons that poorer families miss out. But it’s a lot harder to make that technical argument once a generation who racked up five-figure debts to get a degree starts entering a parliament full of people who mostly went for free, and who suddenly find their moral authority evaporating as a result.The truth is that Generation X graduates got lucky, and luck is never fair. We were simply born at what we didn’t know then was the right time early enough not to get caught by the introduction of fees in 1998, but late enough for universities to have started expanding a little, taking in not just old Etonians but kids like me who were the first in their families to experience higher education. And it wasn’t just the debt – although arguably it more closely resembles a graduate tax – that we managed to duck.We didn’t have the gnawing anxiety I see in students now, who can’t afford to miss a single lecture who spend their holidays frantically chasing internships, because they want to get good enough jobs to make it all worthwhile. Tuition fees haven’t just shaped their finances, they have shaped the way they live their daily lives.There was nothing malicious about what the lucky generation did, of course, in taking advantage of what was freely given. But we did nothing much to earn that luck either, any more than many of us earned the happy accident of graduating when jobs weren’t so hard to come by (at least compared to the stagnant years following the banking crash) or flats in London were still just about affordable. It was just a good time to be young. But it’s left us without much of a leg to stand on.Unfortunately for everyone concerned, the facts of higher education finance haven’t changed. The biggest practical obstacle facing poorer students arguably isn’t debt, but the fact that they are disproportionately less likely either to do A-levels or to achieve the best grades. Tackling that means ploughing cash into closing the gap from early years education onwards, plus more use of lower offers for kids who have overcome considerable odds to get a B – although the new student quango, the Office for Students, is currently reviewing the case for what it calls an even more radical approach to shaking up admissions.There’s a separate philosophical argument to be had about whether higher education is such a universal good that the state should pay for everyone to access it, of course, but even that will come up against the pressure to prioritise in what are likely to be lean times post-Brexit. If I could bring back one thing from the 1990s it wouldn’t be free tuition but means-tested maintenance grants to cover student living costs, so the young people whose parents can’t afford to subsidise them well into their 20s don’t feel forced to go straight out to work.Hovering in the wings, meanwhile, is the Augar review commissioned by Theresa May, now sitting on Johnson’s desk, arguing for major investment in further education (which overwhelmingly would benefit working-class kids) and cutting tuition fees to £7,500. (Although that isn’t enough to close the unfair gap emerging between students whose parents pay upfront, so that they never have to enter the loans system, and those who graduate owing more than they are realistically going to repay.)But no technical policy fix can solve the tricky political problem that the new parliamentary intake is highlighting – which is that, as every parent knows, “do as I say, not as I did” is a spectacularly unpersuasive argument. Get lucky, and you lose the moral high ground from which to deny that same luck to others. The trouble with getting anything for free is that, sooner or later, there ends up being a bill to pay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05c9d54f4ed481cfeb6db1a8eeab224e2c7976a4/0_353_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a44f44de52508f66f938d33e2b813f0e","title":"minister criticises lack of senior black uk academics","story":"Universities must reflect society and improve students’ experience, says Chris SkidmoreThe universities minister has criticised UK higher education institutions for their failure to recruit and promote black and minority ethnic academics, after figures showed that no black staff were employed at the most senior levels.Chris Skidmore, higher education minister for England, said it was unacceptable that the number of black academics in the most senior leadership roles had fallen from an estimated five in 2017-18 to possibly zero in the last academic year.According to figures published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa), in 2018-19 there were 535 staff employed as “managers, directors or senior officials” across British universities, of which 475 identified as white, 25 as Asian, mixed or other ethnicity, and none as black. The ethnicity of the remaining 35 was not known.“It is unacceptable that the number of black academic staff in senior positions has fallen, as this does not represent our British society,” Skidmore said. “Universities need to make more progress and I urge all vice-chancellors to address the barriers that are holding back black and ethnic minority staff from senior positions.The figures also showed that only 185 out of 11,860 non-academic managerial roles were filled by black staff, compared with 10,510 who identified as white, 410 as Asian and 165 from a mixed background.There was a welcome fall in the proportion of academic staff employed on zero-hours contracts, with 4,250 recorded compared with 6,500 the previous year, excluding those classified as “atypical” contracts such as one-off roles or for terms of less than a month.The Department for Education also published data on student employment outcomes, looking at regional influences on a graduate’s pay. It found that a number of institutions saw substantial changes to the average pay of their former students based on where they lived five years after graduation.Overall, graduates of selective London universities and others such as Oxford and Cambridge still enjoyed a pay premium over students from comparable institutions elsewhere in England, although Scottish universities also had higher outcomes.The exceptions included graduates from the private Ravensbourne University in London. On an unadjusted basis, the median graduate pay was £27,700, but that fell to £18,900 because of relatively low pay rates compared with others in London. In contrast, Leeds City College, a further education college, had median pay worth more than £45,000 for its small number of graduates.The figures showed greater pay variation for graduates of the same universities within regions than between regions, although there were some curious results: graduates from Imperial College had an adjusted average pay of £43,000, but those who moved to Wales earned £50,000, more than those who stayed in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f97d01e4a4dba20769f24498b7daf17d22adbf1/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19dc1fd8c8a1b3cbb823e988c88df0a9","title":"how the middle easts water shortage drives demand for live animal imports","story":"The increasingly dry region relies on imports of sheep and cows from as far as Brazil to satisfy the rapidly growing populationCows are waiting in pens, on sweet-smelling fresh straw. They have come to Lebanon from Spain, from Romania. In the one end of the alley are two pens packed with enormous Brahman cattle, standing well over six feet with their distinctive humps, all the way from Brazil.“They are the most aggressive,” says one of the slaughterhouse staff. “It’s just their personalities.”As the Beirut traffic continues its usual honking chaos outside, the animals wait to be slaughtered. When the time comes they go, one at a time, through the hatch into the gleaming tiled kill room.This week the ’s\u0026nbspAnimals Farmed\u0026nbspseries is focusing on the global live animal export trade, which, despite welfare and disease concerns, has\u0026nbspquadrupled over the last fifty years.Nearly 2 billion animals a year are loaded onto trucks or ships and sent off to new countries on journeys that can take weeks.\u0026nbspEvery day at least 5 million creatures are in transit, in a secretive global trade in live farm animals.\u0026nbspAnd those numbers are just the cross-border journeys. They do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down.We’re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of\u0026nbspthis global trade.\u0026nbsp“They don’t see each other being killed,” says our guide. They are put on a hoist and tugged up by their legs, and then their throat is slit. There is no stunning here: the cattle is slaughtered according to the rules of halal, which in most interpretations means that the animal should be conscious when it dies. The floor glistens with water it is washed down between each kill so the animals can’t smell the blood, although they may notice the carcasses of their brethren, dangling from hoists around them.The killing must be quick and well done, says one slaughterhouse employee, in his early twenties. He doesn’t like to think about what he does, he says. But it’s a job.The reputation of slaughterhouses in the Middle East is poor among animal welfare campaigners. Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser at Compassion in World Farmings says that in his 28-year career “there is nothing I have seen as awful as slaughterhouses” in the Middle East. Investigation after investigation has exposed filthy conditions, little or no concern for animal welfare, badly trained staff, and, above all, the practice of halal slaughter, which often means animals are killed without being stunned first.Live animal exports to the Middle East have risen steadily over the past two decades, particularly from Europe. Trade to Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia has risen steeply over the last fifteen years. In just one year, Turkey went from importing $600m (£457m)  worth of animals in 2016 to $1.2bn in 2017.There are a number of reasons for the rise, but it is mainly due to an increasing demand for meat and dairy products, and rapidly warming climate pressuring water-stressed nations. Those nations that can afford the political or financial cost are increasingly looking to avoid rearing animals from birth, the more water-intensive option.As growing populations continue to demand freshly-killed, Middle Eastern nations are increasingly leaning on live imports to meet this need, and reshaping the global marketplace in the process.It’s a region where meat is often seen as a status symbol of a family’s ability to provide, and serving meat to a hungry guest is considered a demonstration of hospitality and generosity. The Islamic high holiday Eid al-Adha – which translates as festival of sacrifice, honouring the biblical figure Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his only son – requires that families slaughter a live animal, often a cow, sheep or goat, and distribute the meat between family, friends and neighbours, and the needy.The Middle East’s growing middle class has also swelled demand, along with overall population growth.Ironically, the warming climate also plays a role in the trade: the lack of water across the Middle East means that it is cheaper to import animals rather than raise them from birth. Dairy cows, a popular import from America and Germany, drink 30–50 gallons of water per day, with high-producing ones consuming even more. Cattle reared for meat consume slightly less water, but the overall amount is enough to encourage water-scarce countries to look for ways to shorten the amount of time they have to care for the animals, while reaping the benefits for their meat industries.“The water shortage in the Gulf is profound and will only get worse as the population increases,” says Hawthorne. “The reality is that they cannot support water-intense livestock and agriculture on the ground. This means the time you hold livestock is important. As it’s expensive, you can only hold them for a temporary period.”A US official with knowledge of the Middle Eastern agriculture industry says countries across the region routinely import beef cattle six months before they are due to be slaughtered, a period in an animal’s life when it requires cheaper feed. Crucially, rearing an animal only in its final stage of life also cuts down on water consumption, a key advantage for water-scarce nations in the Gulf and across north Africa.“Sudan is the largest single supplier of live animals – mostly cows – to Egypt,” they explain, as an example. In Egypt, where the government has placed a premium on local beef, producers import cows at 12-months old, raising them for a final six months before slaughter in order to save on water and the expensive nutrient-rich feed the animals need earlier in life. “Egyptian beef farmers can then sell at market and say their product is Egyptian beef. But in terms of Sudanese water and feed – Egypt saves on those resources,” the official adds.This bait-and-switch tactic could also benefit authorities’ claims to be helping local producers. “There are many programmes to expand domestic animal production. By importing animals grown in Sudan, rearing them for six months then selling them as Egyptian beef, the government can say: ‘look we’re helping Egyptian farmers’,” the official explains.But as the trade grows, the issues around management and oversight of slaughterhouses in the region become more pressing. A 2014 investigation by Compassion in World Farming with Animals Australia allegedly uncovered footage of animals exported from the EU being violently handled in abattoirs in the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, including being dragged into position by their tails and even eye sockets.“Criticism of slaughter standards in the Middle East is not a disparagement of their religion,” says Stevenson.“Whenever Muslims see our films they are horrified and say ‘this is not halal’. Traditional religious slaughter calls for one clean cut which severs all of the major blood vessels so the animal loses blood and dies quickly, but in reality animals often receive many stabs and cuts to the throat before losing consciousness … in the slaughterhouse we’ve seen they don’t know how to handle cattle, they’re frightened of them.”Change is underway, however. In Turkey, steady work by Eyes On Animals and other groups has led to the acceptance of the use of stun guns in some abattoirs, and in October last year Ismailağa Cemaati, the largest Islamic group in the country, publically announced that stunning animals prior to killing them is acceptable and halal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c49f49b883c3274909db46797b8e2757214aa9f/0_0_4928_3279/master/4928.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7399098916205bbdb2b675b51418b44a 1400w","title":"the poor deserve more than ration book food staples","story":"In the nine years since I first visited a food bank they have become dispiritingly commonplace – as have the weird ideas about what we’re supposed to donateOne thing I never thought this was was a story about food. I didn’t even look inside the parcels it would have felt incredibly intrusive, a little like poking through someone else’s shopping trolley. The first backlash moment I remember was when someone – a reader, I couldn’t possibly guess of which newspaper – spotted some Maldon sea salt on a food bank shelf. Thus was the truth unmasked: that these people were not hungry at all, they were just in it for the incredibly expensive salt. Jack Monroe, the Bootstrap Cook, who has done the extraordinary work of building a recipe encyclopaedia from the foods you might get at a food bank, pointed out that they were just working with whatever people had donated. Users may, occasionally, get some peaches in armagnac that would not be proof positive that they weren’t destitute.Despite making perfect sense, the point did not land: the new normal was that food had to be extremely basic, otherwise food bank users were somehow in breach of their “contract”. There is necessity and there is pleasure, and if they ever coexist, the need is a lie. Monroe has worked tirelessly against this, insisting on pleasure in whatever bag of lentils she chances upon, but she seems to be doing this almost singlehandedly. By 2017, some supermarkets were handing out suggested shopping lists if you wanted to donate: tinned meat, fish, fruit, veg, soup and pulses UHT milk tea, coffee, rice and pasta. Of course, they have to be tinned, since they can’t be perishable (although arguably, usage is so high now that shifting a few bananas wouldn’t be very hard).Absent a can of condensed milk, this is exactly the food my mum used to keep in the cellar (she said in case we got snowed in, but really for the untoward event of a nuclear war). To give “austerity” its fullest meaning, this – minus the pasta – is a postwar shopping list, the food you would eat without complaint in the immediate aftermath of a national disaster. The Trussell Trust typically tries to include some biscuits, but its offering is still strikingly pared down. This is about more than what people happen to donate: there are conventions, now, around what you’re supposed to donate. So in Cardiff, two Christmases ago, there was a glut of baked beans and tea bags, but an urgent shortage of sponge puddings. That made perfect sense: if a food parcel is political, which it is, then its contents will be scrutinised, and somebody, somewhere, will call a pudding empty calories. Why would a person in genuine need eat an empty calorie? Beans? Now there’s an honest food. Basic enough that nobody is getting something for nothing.It is actually the food itself, more than the widespread experience of hunger, that distils the difference between charity and social security. With charity comes the end of privacy, since your basket is everybody’s business. But it also builds a very functional view of the body, insofar as the least it requires to survive is also the most that it needs, as though you are talking about horses, or rabbits (dogs are exempt from this narrative God knows how they got away with it, but it would be considered very inhumane never to give a dog a treat). And the fact that you can imagine all these foods on the basics list of a ration card, instead of ringing any alarm bells (hang on a second: we didn’t have a war we don’t have a national food shortage), only serves to reinforce the notion that it is somehow character-building, because, you know, wars are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce32208d185f2df7a3b9bf753291935a99ff9483/54_127_3379_2027/master/3379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e1c4c05e20675f2b81707b8c7dd4199","title":"tranmere watford fa cup third round replay match report","story":"Watford suffered the upset at Tranmere but Manchester United will have felt a little queasy too. Prenton Park awaits Ole Gunnar Solskjær on Sunday and a trip to a weakened Premier League opponent may have been preferable to visiting a bog of a pitch plus a team languishing 21st in League One with nothing to lose. On this evidence Micky Mellon’s side will relish the chance to claim another top-flight scalp.Tranmere’s substitute Paul Mullin scored the extra-time winner that secured a lucrative date with United in the fourth round. The striker, whose late goal completed Rovers’ comeback from three goals down at Vicarage Road, headed home from close range after the impressive Corey Blackett-Taylor glanced on a cross from substitute Harvey Gilmour. Tranmere, ahead through Manny Monthé but pegged back in normal time by Kaylen Hinds’s equaliser, should have won inside 90 minutes against a makeshift Watford team who laboured throughout. The victors will not mind going the extra mile for the opportunity to increase Solskjær’s torment, however.Nigel Pearson, to his credit, was gracious in defeat and blamed neither the poor playing surface nor his changes for the early exit, although the Watford manager was pointed in his criticism of some of the club’s young players who failed to seize their chance to impress. “Some of our young players thought they could just turn up in the first half,” he said. “You have to earn the right to play. It was a bit of a reality check for some. Welcome to the man’s game.”Tranmere signalled their intent to subject Watford to an awkward night from the outset. The incentive was clear in the form of a potential showpiece against United but also in the opportunity to vanquish Premier League opposition beforehand. With the exception of Andre Gray, José Holebas and Christian Kabasele, the visitors were a top-flight unit in name only. Having watched his side suffer a late league defeat at Aston Villa only 48 hours earlier, Pearson had little choice but to make wholesale changes for the replay. The average age of a Watford team featuring four debutants and several academy players was 23. Unsurprisingly, they struggled to establish a rhythm against more settled opponents, although there was less excuse for the passive nature of their overall display.The power and pace of Rovers’ target man Morgan Ferrier unsettled the visitors’ defence while Blackett-Taylor ensured Mason Barrett’s debut at right-back for Watford was far from comfortable. Blackett-Taylor threatened whenever Tranmere found him in space on the left – no mean feat considering he was operating on a beach rather than a football pitch given the amount of sand down the flanks – and could have scored twice with the game goalless only to blaze both over.Pearson’s team did not test Rovers’ keeper Scott Davies once in the first half – a series of ambitious shots from Domingos Quina in central midfield was as close as they came – and their defensive frailties cost them at a corner delivered by Blackett-Taylor. Several Watford defenders were unable to clear under pressure from Peter Clarke and the ball dropped to Monthé lurking just outside the area. His left-foot shot carried power but deceived Daniel Bachmann with a deflection before finding the net via the inside of the far post. It was the towering defender’s third goal in four matches – including one in the comeback from three goals down at Vicarage Road – and no more than Mellon’s side deserved.Pearson made just one change at the interval, with Hinds replacing Tom Dele-Bashiru, but whatever he said during the break injected some much-needed urgency into the Watford performance. The visitors should have levelled early in the second half when João Pedro found himself clean through on goal. The Brazilian forward fired low but straight at Davies, who spread himself well, and Holebas headed a difficult rebound high and wide.The Watford left-back was a fraction away from converting his next opportunity after sweeping an inviting free-kick into the area. Tranmere cleared only as far as Barrett, who sliced a shot back across goal to Holebas from 20 yards. He connected with a thunderous volley that struck the angle of post and bar and Rovers were reprieved. But not for much longer. Pressure on the home defence was growing and Watford equalised after a Holebas corner caused pandemonium inside Rovers’ six-yard box. Davies was unable to hold on to a Pedro header and, amid the goalmouth scrambled that followed, Hinds scored from close range.Mellon replaced the injured Ferrier with Mullin and the substitute almost restored his side’s lead after a mix-up in the Watford defence. Mullin rounded Bachmann but could only find the side-netting from a tight angle as the ball rolled away from goal. The veteran Neil Danns went close twice in normal time and Tranmere’s victory, though delayed, was thoroughly deserved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bbea94c2e9f2345564fecb329187f156757b629/37_0_3423_2054/master/3423.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e514304c840d1dacc6bbe3f130352f02","title":"wolves liverpool premier league match report","story":"This happens so often one would almost think it is normal.

But, as ever, Liverpool found a way to prevail even though they lost Sadio Mané to a suspected hamstring injury in the first half. Roberto Firmino, who had been subdued for long periods, struck six minutes from time to extend an extraordinary record that owes as much to iron will as it does to silky skill.Henderson personified those attributes so it was fitting that he set up the winning goal by dabbing a sly pass through to Firmino. The Brazilian had missed his first good chance of the match a few minutes earlier but this time his finish was impeccable, as he glided past a defender before slamming a left-foot shot into the top corner from eight yards.This time last year Wolves beat a second-string Liverpool 2-1 here to oust them from the FA Cup four days after Klopp’s first-choice team had lost by the same score at Manchester City. That latter match ultimately decided the outcome of last season’s title race but also, by hardening Liverpool’s focus, set in train this season’s seemingly relentless pursuit of glory. Nobody has beaten them in the league since then. Wolves came closer than most.Nuno Espírito Santo named the same side that started Saturday’s phenomenal fightback against Southampton and was happy to be able to include Willy Boly and Diogo Jota after long injury layoffs during which Wolves’ small squad have thrilled while making light of a heavy workload.In their 40th match of an epic season they went for the jugular from the start. In the fourth minute Trent Alexander-Arnold was so overwhelmed he resorted to pulling back Jonny Otto. João Moutinho sent the free-kick from the left across the face of goal, tantalisingly out of reach of the attackers straining to apply a decisive touch. But two minutes later Alexander-Arnold did what he does best, offering a beautiful delivery, from a corner, to Henderson, who headed the ball on to his shoulder and into the net from six yards. It was not the cleanest connection but the way Liverpool’s captain won the ball in a crowded box spoke of his powerful drive as well as of Alexander-Arnold’s accuracy. Henderson continued to direct Liverpool’s operations with busy authority.Moutinho did likewise for Wolves, and Liverpool were far from dominant. They were downright slapdash in the 11th minute when Wolves outwitted them with a short corner. They were lucky Matt Doherty headed wide from eight yards.Wolves, specialists in winning after falling behind, were never going to be weakened by doubt. Adama Traoré was a spectacular menace. After one of the his runs and crosses Alexander-Arnold had to throw himself in front of a shot by Jiménez. Then Liverpool hurtled down the other end and Mané floated a pass from the left to Mohamed Salah, who chose not to shoot with his right foot, instead cutting back on to his left, which allowed Jonny and Rui Patrício to block his shot.Mané limped off soon after and had to be replaced in the 33rd minute by Takumi Minamino. The Japanese might have marked his Premier League debut with a goal if Salah had passed to him just before the break but the Egyptian chose to go it alone and Doherty got in the way. Minamino was bypassed for most of the rest of the game, too. This pulsating contest amounted to a heck of an introduction to the Premier League.Salah created a chance for himself just after the interval, losing the ball to Traoré but then pinching it back and blasting at goal from 16 yards. Patrício saved. Then Jiménez and Traoré gave a masterful lesson in forward play.First the Mexican duped Andy Robertson with a canny feint and dash near half way, then he slipped a pass into the gap left by the Scot. Traoré took the cue and raced on to the ball, then clipped a perfect cross back to Jiménez, who guided a sumptuous header past Alisson. It took something special to deny Liverpool an eighth consecutive clean sheet.Wolves were not sated. Within moments Traoré flew past Robertson again. The frazzled left-back stretched out a leg to take him down just outside the box, happy to accept a yellow card rather than concede a goal or a penalty.For a while Wolves threatened to take over. Alisson had to turn away a shot by Traoré in the 62nd minute. Five minutes later Traoré showed his subtle side, threading a lovely pass through to Jiménez. Alisson stood firm again.Then, just as home fans sensed another famous win, Firmino came to the fore and a swashbuckling encounter ended with a result that has become amazingly routine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/932cd1d44cb69b53a87610fd30c9c4aa37672cf1/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5032ea6f8943ac83f1200522ea11d577","title":"fa cup fourth round 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Slaven Bilic returns to West Ham, Chris Wilder goes back to where it all began and Arsenal may turn to Eddie NketiahShrewsbury are not averse to a flush of FA Cup romance. In January 2003 they were at the foot of the fourth tier when Everton visited and the wily old hands, Ian Woan and Nigel Jemson, combined to confirm one of this millennium’s more famous shocks. Wind back a couple of decades and they enjoyed two quarter-final appearances under Graham Turner. Between the two, in 1996, there was a fourth-round tie against Roy Evans’ Liverpool, who came away comfortable 4-0 winners. The local newspaper worked out that it was a meeting of teams worth £195,000 and £29.6m respectively. Back then it was an eye-watering disparity but nowadays the latter figure would not even buy you Sadio Mané’s weaker left foot. The Shrews are comfortable enough in League One’s midfield these days but Liverpool’s modern-day visit is arguably the toughest assignment they have ever faced. The beauty of the cup, though, is that it still manages to create heroes nobody would ever have foreseen. Perhaps Shrewsbury could be the team that finally shatter the Premier League leaders’ veneer of invincibility.

It took three matches to separate them in 1902, eventual finalists Saints seeing off the holders in the second replay, played in a blizzard at Reading. “The snow had played sad havoc with the ground, and the ‘going’ was extremely bad,” complained Sporting Life. The great sporting polymath CB Fry, most famous now for his cricket but who also got one England cap at football, was in the Southampton team for all three matches and his performances earned particular praise: “The harder the match and the more work he has to accomplish, the better Fry seems to acquit himself,” wrote the Sportsman. Fry’s side won 2-1, with all three goals down to inidual errors: first Fry’s miskick presented the ball to Gilhooly, who crossed for Kirwan to score then a calamity from the Spurs goalkeeper, Griffiths, as he attempted to save Arthur Turner’s shot “but tripped up just as he got his hands down to the ball”. With three minutes remaining Tait, a Spurs defender, panicked under the Saints’ high press and underhit a backpass, which Brown tapped in. Something similarly entertaining would be welcome this weekend, though snow is not forecast.. SBHaving failed to advance beyond the fourth round of the FA Cup in their past 13 attempts, Newcastle will fancy their chances of doing so after being given a home tie against opponents who sit 35 rungs below them on the league ladder. Steve Bruce’s side are leading a charmed life at the moment, having pulled off remarkable late smash-and-grabs despite being outplayed in their most recent matches against Chelsea and Everton, but will be expected to adopt a more aggressive approach against Oxford United. With the League One side’s manager, Karl Robinson, being renowned as a thoughtful and innovative advocate of intricate attacking football, there is potential for an upset against fatigued hosts in what could be one of the ties of the round. BGLodgers turn landlords for the day as Coventry host Birmingham, the team whose ground they occupy every other weekend as tenants. Coventry will change in the home dressing-room as Birmingham play the role of visitors to their own stadium. Coventry manager Mark Robins is synonymous with the FA Cup, as the substitute whose third-round goal against Nottingham Forest may well have kept Sir Alex Ferguson from losing the Manchester United job 30 years ago. Robins is looking forward to testing his team against Championship opposition in front of a sell-out crowd on an occasion he concedes will be “weird” for both teams. Despite their exile from the Ricoh Arena and a shoestring budget, Robins has steered Coventry to within threepoints of the League One summit. More frequent tests against second-tier opposition could be on the horizon. BGArsenal’s battling point at Stamford Bridge did the world of good for their spirits but did not quite set them up for a concerted tilt at the top four, much as Mikel Arteta believes one is still achievable. They are definitely in no position to shun the FA Cup, a competition whose benefits Arteta knows from personal experience. The manager is likely to select as strong a line-up as possible at Bournemouth in a bid to reach the last 16 and maintain momentum. He may be tempted to give Eddie Nketiah a first look from the start since the young striker’s return from Leeds. That loan did not quite work out, despite a strong first few weeks from the 20-year-old, but Arteta was impressed enough to rule that he would not be sent out elsewhere. Gabriel Martinelli has stood up to outstanding effect during Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s suspension and this, in the captain’s final match out, could be a perfect opportunity to see whether Nketiah is similarly capable. NAPrecisely half of this weekend’s Cup ties will be televised in the UK, but on the face of it, this meeting of the sides 14th and 10th in the Championship is not among the obvious choices. However, QPR are without a goalless draw all season, and have developed a habit of producing wild scorelines. This month, they have beaten Cardiff 6-1 and Swansea 5-1 (in the third round). Their 10 games since the start of December have featured, on average, 3.8 goals each, and only Luton have fewer than their three clean sheets. Wednesday will be taking this game extremely seriously, as they look to find form after losing four of their last five league games, including a 5-0 thrashing at home by Blackburn. “It’s a game we want and we need to win,” says their manager, Garry Monk. ” SBLast weekend West Ham contested the David Moyes Derby against Everton and now, hot on its heels, comes another meeting dominated by one of the managers. Slaven Bilic is now in charge at West Brom, and still on course to lead them back to the Premier League despite rocky recent form and a home defeat to Stoke on Monday. Bilic was sacked by the Hammers in November 2017 after almost two-and-a-half years in charge. The accompanying statement – “West Ham United believe a change is now necessary in order for the club to move forward positively and in line with their ambition” – has certainly not aged well. West Ham may not have been going anywhere especially fast under Bilic and there is no point in making revisionist claims about the wisdom behind his dismissal. But everything since reinforces the point that their real problems lie higher up the chain. The Croatian might see Saturday’s tie as an opportunity to show which party is now heading in the right direction. NAHaving been pipped to promotion by Barnsley last season, Portsmouth get the opportunity to exact a modicum of revenge when they entertain the Championship strugglers at Fratton Park this weekend. One of several fourth-round fixtures guaranteed to sell out in a competition increasingly renowned for dwindling attendances in its early rounds, it promises to be one of the weekend’s more raucous affairs, even if both managers have bigger fish to fry. “It’s not as important as the league – none of the competitions are,” said Pompey manager Kenny Jackett, hardly doing his bit to ensure the turnstiles click with their usual fervour. “But when they come around you want to do well.” Jackett has form there, leading his holders back to the EFL Trophy semi-finals this week. BGGriffin Park could well host the final FA Cup match of its 116-year history this weekend, with Brentford set to move to their new Community Stadium from next season. But with a pub on all four corners, a standing section for away supporters and with fans close enough to the pitch that they can be splattered with mud from nearby tackles, Griffin Park remains a special place. It is a ground from another era, even if it is probably not befitting of a club with serious Premier League ambitions . It should serve as a timely reminder to Leicester fans – who regularly frequented these sort of grounds in the lower leagues not too long ago – just how far they have come, even with the anomaly of 2016 in their memories. With two teams in rip-roaring form, playing free-flowing football, it should be a fine day for those lucky enough to go. Drink it in.

And thanks for reading! We’ve seen Liverpool do exactly what champions do they are a machine, and a mighty fine one at that. Catch you again soon – take care!“The chances we had were incredible. We were four or five times in front of the goalie. We won the game, incredibly difficult, but who cares? We didn’t panic but it is not that we were completely in the mood I wanted at 1-1.“Just to point out, Liverpool are now guaranteed safe from relegation,” writes David Grey. They’ll be partying on the streets on Merseyside!Nuno speaks: “Very good performance. I think we performed well, defensively well organised, created a lot of chances and the momentum was there. We were facing a very good team but I was very happy with the boys. Small margins, details.You won’t want to miss Paul Doyle’s match report of *that*: Jordan Henderson: “We had some chances to put the game to bed which is something we want to improve on and kill the game earlier. But we showed the mentality to keep going.“It’s just about the next game, keep going, every game is the biggest game of the season as the manager keeps saying to us.”Virgil van Dijk: “You need to give them credit, they played good, they have good players. They’re difficult to break down, created moments of danger and we had to dig deep. We’re not happy about the goal we conceded but how we reacted is a good thing and we know we’re always going to have chances.Liverpool go SIXTEEN points clear with a game in hand. But that’s not half the story! They were pushed harder than they have been all season here – but they found a way through with Firmino’s fine later winner!90+4 min: One last bite for Wolves but a Doherty throw is cleared. And then ...90+2 min: Sky give man of the match to Traore and would anyone disagree? He has been immense. The best team in the world has found him virtually impossible to deal with. Now he goes on another run as we speak ... and oh, my!! His cross is yet again right on point and nudged back by Jimenez for Jota .. who screws over from in front of goal! Both managers go berserk for very different reasons.90+1 min: Four added minutes for Wolves to turn this again ...90 min: Do Wolves have one more push in them? This must be so deflating now. Liverpool are playing the ball around in their half and, not before time, now seem to be well in control.87 min: Moutinho is replaced by Gibbs-White. My word, how well Wolves have played here. But Liverpool are incredible.Un. Be. Lievable. Liverpool are going to win the league at an absolute canter and this is exactly why. They always come up with something and this time Firmino gets it right after Salah, with some beautiful control and footwork, lays off to Henderson. The skipper promptly plays Firmino in just like that and, after cutting inside, he blasts it high into the net! Nothing can stop this team.82 min: And now Liverpool get their big chance! Firmino dances beautifully past Coady and probably scores if he lifts the ball over Patricio. Instead he goes low and it’s a vital save. That would have been against the run of virtually this entire half.81 min: Jota is presented with the ball by – gasp! – a sloppy Van Dijk header. If he sees Traore sprinting beyond Wijnaldum to his right, Traore is clean through! He looks the other way and makes the wrong choice!80 min: Gomez and Jota engage in a 5050 grapple that ends, I think, in a booking for Gomez. More importantly Moutinho can deliver another dangerous free-kick ... from which Alisson is crowded out and fouled.77 min: A game like this is good for Liverpool, no? They’ve been properly extended in a right royal tussle not necessarily the better side. In fact definitely not the better side. That’s football, right? Wolves roll the dice with Jota making his return, replacing the watchable Neto.74 min: Traore goes part of the way past Van Dijk but then seems to lose confidence, weirdly, even though with one more step he’d be virtually clear. He shoots too early, from 22 yards, and drags it wide.73 min: Coady stops Firminho latching onto a Robertson ball at the near post. Have Liverpool sorted this out now? The evidence is not that compelling given the unconvincing way in which, right down the other end, they panickily crowd a Neto run out as he makes for the area.70 min: But there’s a reminder that Salah is still here, and thus so are Liverpool. He slaloms across the 18-yard line and shoots just wide of the near post. Oxlade-Chamberlain’s dynamism is thereafter sacrificed for Fabinho’s diligence.68 min: Alisson bails out Liverpool again after the unplayable Traore slips through the almost unplayable Jimenez, who is onside but at enough of a tight angle to make the chance tricky. The keeper spreads himself and saves. Liverpool are in trouble and Klopp is prowling that technical area like there’s no tomorrow.66 min: Now a Neves ball arcs across the six-yard line and I have not seen Liverpool given this much trouble all season – seriously.65 min: What a save from Alisson! Traore has room again and is thwarted by a low one-handed stop as he looks to rake one into the bottom corner!64 min: Neto has looked trickily useful at times without quite getting away down that left flank. He does pretty well again but then Wolves are forced back. They sensibly build again from the back they are controlling this game just now.“With all due respect to Jürgen Klopp, it’s time Liverpool went Nigel Pearson on these pesky Wolves.”60 min: Minamino does get a shooting chance after good work from Salah but his weighted shot from the edge of the box is blocked – and Firmino blasts the rebound at Patricio.59 min: Minus Mane, Liverpool just don’t have one of their most potent attacking outlets and are finding it hard to get back up the pitch. They need to get a foothold again here. They always find a way ... don’t they?57 min: Moutinho’s free-kick is punched away by Alisson. Wolves are all over this!56 min: And Traore is away again ... and Robertson is booked for scything him down *just* outside the area ...55 min: Traore rips down that right flank again and Liverpool just aren’t handling him. They haven’t met an opponent like this all season. Jimenez can’t quite master his latest cross in a deep position.54 min: They chant Traore’s name from the stands, and what a delivery that was. Liverpool are on the rack now! It’s game on!They deserve that!! It’s a brilliant, trademark, powerful header from the striker, and what a one-two! It’s Jimenez who marauds into the Liverpool half and feeds Traore into space before continuing his run into the box. Traore delivers expertly and directs his finish wonderfully into the corner on the run! How do Liverpool respond now?50 min: Rattling early tempo here, again, and Wolves have come out full of intent.48 min: Then Neto is sent away by a lucky ricochet, but lacks conviction and Gomez blocks! That, too, was a chance and Wolves may regret not taking it.47 min: Traore messes around just outside his own area and is *very* lucky that Salah, picking his pocket, can’t beat Patricio with an arrowed left-footer. It’s batted around the left post and the corner is defender desperately after Henderson – again – wins the header.I reckon he’s got that for life now.It is a very, very fair point.Salah weaves clear and takes aim, but is thwarted by a brave sliding block from Doherty. Could yet be a crucial moment. And that, there, is the half! That early Henderson headershoulderer is the difference in a half that has otherwise been pretty even. It started at one heck of a pace and Doherty really should have equalised for Wolves. From the midway point it became a little more nip and tuck but Wolves are well in this, still. For Liverpool there is the worry of Mane’s early departure.43 min: Jimenez thinks he’s got a clear crack at goal after fine work by Saiss but Van Dijk, giant among men that he is, tracks him all the way and blocks. But Wolves keep the ball alive and do win a left-sided corner ... which is well defended by the otherwise quiet Firmino.42 min: “Did you know your name is an anagram of “Mané sick”?” asks Peter Oh of me, your unassuming MBM-er.“Oh dear me, please don’t let it be a bad injury.”Hands up, I’ve always known this day would come.40 min: Whisper it, but Liverpool have not really created a lot since scoring.38 min: Nice control from Jimenez, who takes possession on the left of the area, takes a couple of touches inside, and then drags wide of Alisson’s near post.36 min: Minamino has started brightly, his exploits including one implausible spin on halfway that may or may not have been the result of a miscontrol.Big call! From Krish and from Wilson.33 min: Yep, it’s the end of Mane. On comes Minamino. I’m sure we will find out what the issue was there soon enough. Mane made his own “substitute me” sign hopefully it is more precautionary than anything.32 min: Neto twists into left-sided space but Gomez heads his cross away. It looks as if Mane is injured and may have to come off ... he’s gone down ...30 min: The game has definitely tightened up a bit, but Wolves have done really well not to let that early goal get to them and at this point it’s still hard to pick a winner. OK, it’s probably going to be Liverpool. But still, there are two very good sides out here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b22991068e563bd7642ffbf06e44159019414e3/106_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4165861e7734a96f8fdc34a1d31adb7b","title":"my best friend seems to have no time for me am i being too demanding","story":"The world ides into people, writes Eleanor Gordon-Smith. Those who need plans and people who are constrained by themMy best friend has a huge network of friends and family and many work and community commitments. I understand these are important and make it hard to find time for us, and I don’t mind. What annoys me is that she won’t make firm plans. Nothing is ever confirmed until the last minute. I’ve tried talking to her about this but she laughs it off. Should I just accept that I’m not a priority? Or am I being too demanding?When I was in school I had a terrible habit of losing things. Expensive orthodontics went into the bin along with my sandwich wrapper and lunch, digital cameras I’d saved for sat quietly on the bus long after I’d got off, more than once a violin ended up in the lost and found of the local transit authority. Even now remembering these is enough to curl my spine up in a wince of embarrassment, but by far the worst was when I lost something I’d received as a gift. I lost a lot of gifts. I don’t know where they went – they plunged into a wormhole of detached pen lids and half a pair of socks and I never saw them again. Frustrated and disappointed, a family member once told me that it was this simple: if I cared about things I wouldn’t lose them.Now I don’t think that’s actually true. I did care about these things, that’s why I was so agonised when I lost them. But the thing this moment emblazoned on my brain was that that didn’t actually matter. I knew I cared, but the important thing was that other people didn’t. From the outside, there was no way of knowing how special these people and their gifts were to me, and I was giving people evidence that made it totally reasonable to conclude that their kindness didn’t register. And that’s not a nice thing to do by the people you care about. You shouldn’t put them in a position where it’s reasonable to conclude that you don’t care about them.Time commitments work a lot like this. The world ides into people who need plans and people who feel constrained by them. In any relationship when the two of you fall on different sides of the ide there’s a neon countdown clock until trouble, because to each of you it will look like the other doesn’t care. You’ll think “if she cared she’d make time” and she’ll think “if she cared she’d stop trying to control my time”.The truth is it doesn’t matter who’s right, just like it doesn’t matter whether I was right about whether you can forget things and value them at the same time. What matters is that you find a language of affection that the other can hear and translate.And sometimes the best language of affection is just saying true stuff out loud. We have all sorts of oblique ways of telling each other we matter – you’re right that making firm plans is one of them. But we can also just say, out loud, “You matter.” If your friend could find a way to make you feel that more firmly, the un-firmness of the plans might not sting so much. Don’t keep asking for plans she might have good reasons to see them as a burden. Allow yourself to ask for a reminder that you’re valued. If she’s a true friend, that’s never a burden.Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

Maybe a guy with a long scarf bicycles past with a pile of books and an oar on each shoulder. Inside, we find a black woman attempting to report a crime to a police inspector, who is theatrically banging his head on the desk and shouting: “Bo-ring!” Could she just tell him about how – . No, she couldn’t, he says, because this is a lovely country, so her experience simply hasn’t happened. He wants us to come together. Why doesn’t she? She needs to stop being the – what’s the expression? Fly in the ointment? Skeleton in the closet? It’s on the tip of his tongue. In fact, if anything, says the inspector, he has been the victim of a crime. Warming to his theme, he rules that the real criminal is her for raising it.Cue opening titles of ITV’s big new Sunday night detective drama: HATHAWAY.In any sane world – I know, right? – this show would already be in production, because that’s the way it has always been, meaning it’s the RIGHT way. First, there was Inspector Morse, starring Inspector Morse, and he was deferentially assisted by Sergeant Lewis. Then, when Morse went to the great whodunnit in the sky, Sergeant Lewis made inspector and, in due course, he got his own show: Lewis. Inspector Lewis was in turn deferentially assisted by Sergeant Hathaway, who I assumed was real, but was apparently played by the actor, musician and thought leader Laurence Fox. In due course, Inspector Lewis himself bowed out, by which point Hathaway had been promoted to inspector.And yet: no eponymous Sunday night show of his own. No deferential sergeant of his own. It’s a scandal. This was the way things were – but now they are not. Similarly, just as there had always been iconic roles for James Fox back in the day, so there would surely always be the same for his son Laurence.But now, evidently, there aren’t. So I want you to forget everything you think you know about what happened since Laurence went on Question Time last week and told a mixed-race audience member she was being racist to him by making boring charges of racism. Tempting as it might be to misdiagnose, this is not just the sort of midlife crisis you would expect from one of the lesser telly chefs.No, THIS is the reality: Laurence’s story is a tale from acting’s rust belt, about the hollowing out of the theatrical heartlands, where the job and dignity your father could count on have been stolen. By whom? I don’t know. Sikhs maybe? We’ll get onto that later. For now, it is increasingly clear that the old certainties have evaporated. And there are some people who are going to feel very, very left behind. We should listen to these actors.Indeed, this is why Laurence could be found on Julia Hartley-Brewer’s TalkRadio show by Monday morning, expanding on his QT rant, going: “We lay all our troubles on the working man. And the working man has had enough of it.”Damn straight. I’ve always felt Laurence has huge second-toughest-at-Rada energy to him. And just like him, I’m sick of these elites who have never done a tough day down t’acting pit. The hardscrabble truth is that the theatrical economy no longer works in the way it did for your daddy or his daddy before him. Or, to put it more specifically re Laurence’s situation: how come HE’S not admiring Hitler in Remains of the Day, while Tony Hopkins has to miss his own dad’s death because he’s got the dinner to serve? Instead, Laurence feels as if his only choice is going on James Delingpole’s podcast to lose his shit that there’s a Sikh in Sam Mendes’s 1917 movie. I mean, I guess it’s zeitgeisty. But set against his dad’s zeitgeisty stuff, it’s not exactly sharing some acid and a French chick with Mick Jagger in Performance, is it?And, of course, when hope moves out, Trump moves in. I think this is why Laurence recently announced that he put on a Maga hat and walked round wherever he lives in south London. He says one woman told him he was crazy. A bit like that scene in Die Hard 3 where Bruce Willis has to stand in Harlem wearing a racist sign or everyone’s going to get blown up by villain Jeremy Irons. (Sidenote: a contempo version of that is exactly the sort of part Laurence should have had. But they have skipped him and gone straight for Tom Hiddleston, haven’t they? The shits.)As for what attracted Fox to Trump, maybe it was the president’s deathless comment: “I love the poorly educated.” And putting my own public school heritage to use, I want to attain the levels of empathy Laurence rose to on Question Time. So I’ll just inform him definitively that a huge amount of his bitterness springs from the fact he went to a minor public school. (Harrow. I will not be taking letters on this classification thank you.)Certainly his outsider shtick is my favourite since Jacob Rees-Mogg (who didn’t go to a minor public school) told last year’s Conservative party conference: “But as I grew up in the British establishment, I know how awful it is. I see its faults perhaps more clearly than most do, and its determination, its anti-democratic wish to cling to its power come what may.” Then again, I think we all have to make a lot of time for the latest effusion from Lily Allen (Bedales), who reacted to Laurence’s nonsense by announcing she was “sick to death of luvvies forcing their opinions on everybody else” and advising him to “stick to acting”. Say what you like about this story, but it really has brought all the preposterous pricks to the yard – and yes, I certainly count myself in that.As for where Laurence could have gone after QT, I suppose he could have donned the Black Poloneck of Poorly Essayed Contrition. I refer of course to the night that Dapper Laughs opted to become Dapper Tears, and appeared on Newsnight to apologise for “pushing the boundaries”.Instead, Fox decided to double down, telling Delingpole of the “oddness” of casting a Sikh in 1917. “It is kind of racist,” he honked, “if you talk about institutional racism, which is what everyone loves to go on about, which I’m not a believer in, there is something institutionally racist about forcing ersity on people in that way.”When the contribution of Sikh soldiers to the first world war was later mentioned to him, he replied: “I’m not a historian.” But luv: you don’t NEED to be a historian. You honestly just need access to the website google. Because if you search the words “Sikhs” and “first world war”, every single result from the very first one down will tell you how Sikh soldiers arrived on the Western front from 1914, how they were instrumental at Ypres, and so on for miles and miles. It literally couldn’t be easier to find out about. But you see, basic investigations aren’t the Hathaway MO. The Hathaway MO is to be profoundly incurious, to not ask any questions at all, or attempt to learn anything, or to think that people with different experiences may have a different point to make from yours. You just accuse the Sikh of ruining the movie.As for where people of colour go after their latest tedious schooling, perhaps they could take #inspo from Laurence himself. After all, this is a man who has repeatedly hawked his orce experiences round the TV interview sofas, in return for the show plugging his band or whatever – yet who begrudges people of colour having the temerity to have their own problems.Yet again, I think the conclusion is that people of colour need to be EVEN more creative in the way they talk about their experiences to snowflakes like Laurence. Just spitballing here, but would it help if they got caught up in a celebrity orce, then had a crap album to promote? Because I feel like then it might finally be permissible for them to speak. Until then, his message is clear: you’re still doing it wrong, guys! Pipe down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1512f449c6871d94ada8daca16c4f9ce3b8b5a25/0_1580_6200_3719/master/6200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38448d65f97c8b3cfff6bcd0eefd3178","title":"victoria derbyshire says not told bbc axing show","story":"Presenter ‘devastated’ by move, which is part of wider changes to be unveiled next weekThe BBC’s decision to axe Victoria Derbyshire’s award-winning BBC show faced a severe backlash on Thursday led by the presenter herself, who said she was “devastated” by the news and revealed that she had not been informed of the decision in advance.As politicians, BBC staffers and guests on the show on Thursday declared their dismay at the decision to axe the BBC Two current affairs and investigative show, an internal email revealed that the move was part of a wider series of changes to be unveiled next week.Derbyshire expressed pride in what she and her team had achieved in less than five years. In her tweets she referred to “breaking tonnes of original stories (which we were asked to do) attracting a working class, young, erse audience that BBC radio \u0026amp and TV news progs just don’t reach (which we were asked to do) \u0026amp smashing the digital figures (which we were asked to do).Derbyshire spoke out on social media around the same time that an email went to all BBC staff from the broadcaster’s director of news and current affairs, Fran Unsworth, confirming the show was ending and telling them the move was part of a “wider series of changes” the BBC would be announcing next week.BBC insiders had suggested the axing of Derbyshire’s show was part of a package of cuts but bungling had caused the news to leak.Closing the show had “not been an easy decision”, added Unsworth, who said it was “exactly the type of journalism we need to continue, reaching audiences who are often underserved by the BBC and we will be retaining some of the programme’s journalism roles to enable us to continue this work”.Further details of that will be unveiled next week, and Unsworth said Derbyshire would be taking “a wider role” across the BBC’s broadcast and digital output and continue to lead on some of the “high-profile audience events and original stories she has championed”.Unsworth continued: “However, audience behaviours are changing. Linear television viewing is declining, and as we progress with our £80m savings target, it is no longer cost-effective to continue producing the programme on television.”However, there was disbelief among those working on the show as Unsworth’s email was digested. One argued that their innovative use of social media, digital reach and ability to do “Panorama-type investigations on a shoestring budget” fitted with what the BBC needed to do as it sought to evolve and survive.It was also suggested that the show – commissioned when James Harding was the director of BBC news and current affairs – had lacked a champion in the BBC’s upper echelons when it came to decisions about cuts.Louisa Compton, the show’s former executive editor and now a commissioning editor at Channel 4’s Dispatches, said its importance could not be underestimated, adding: “It’s probably the only programme across all channels that gives a particular voice to the voiceless.”It had set out to reach an audience that included working-class viewers, stay-at-home mothers and those who were not served by Newsnight or Today, she added, through coverage such as that of domestic abuse and Grenfell.As a petition to save the show gathered pace, journalists and media figures including the radio presenter James O’Brien and Piers Morgan expressed regret at the decision, and the TV presenter Dermot O’Leary described the move as “bewildering” and “plain wrong”.“A brilliant show that puts real people and difficult subjects at its heart. It works. Odd, and just plain wrong,” he tweeted.A former guest of the show, a survivor of sexual abuse who spoke on it last year about the impact of the double jeopardy rule – a legal principle which prevented people being tried for the same crime twice – said she was “devastated” to hear it had been cancelled, as it “was such a big moment for us”.“It helped us tell our story on a much wider platform – it was in the news, on Twitter, on Facebook,” she added.Kelly Ward, who spoke on the show on Wednesday about her brother, who took his own life last year, said: “Without the show, his story would have never fully got out there … It touches taboo subjects in a positive way.”Journalists from the programme also voiced their disappointment. Ellie Costello, a reporter on the programme since September, emphasised the strengths of the “talented, creative” senior women who led the team and added: “It is devastating to be told that such a trailblazing team could be taken off-air.”Tracy Brabin, the Labour MP and shadow culture minister, will write to the outgoing director general, Tony Hall, to urge a “rethink” of the decision and ask for a commitment to the type of journalism that has become associated with it.Describing the show as “brave and courageous journalism at its very best”, she spoke of how it often brought attention to the issues that MPs find in their surgeries “but wouldn’t find their way into the mainstream press”.The Conservative MP Damian Collins, who is seeking re-election as chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said it was “disturbing” to hear of reports of planned cuts to BBC News.But another Tory MP, Michael Fabricant, said: “Personally, I am pleased the Victoria Derbyshire programme is being axed. I found it turgid, mostly dull, and trivial.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f757a5227b018e64eac33dc80c7ec021ba7174dd/0_534_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3d5375ede5584e0b819af6a6beac413","title":"j hus big conspiracy album review","story":"(Black Butter Limited)More introspective and subdued following a spell in prison – though with libido intact – J Hus is still masterfully blending stylesThat someone believed there were people out there willing to spend a tenner in order to hear an album – or a version thereof – three days before they could stream the real thing for free tells you something about the degree of anticipation surrounding Big Conspiracy. The Top 10 success of Common Sense represented a coming-out ball for a London sub-genre that no one could seem to decide what to call: Afro swing, trapfrobeat, Afro bashment. The struggle to find a name for it made a weird kind of sense, because the contents of Common Sense were hard to pin down: its sound kept shifting from hard-hitting to melodic and commercial, from music rooted in bashment or Afrobeats to stuff not unlike 90s US hip-hop. What it didn’t sound like was anything else UK rap had to offer – no mean feat given the sheer quantity of artists achieving crossover success.Understandably, expectations for its successor run high, stoked by the fact that J Hus spent three months of the two-and-a-half years since its release in prison for carrying a knife. It did nothing to dent his popularity – the first single from Big Conspiracy, Must Be, reached No 5 – but listening to the album itself, the episode seems to have impacted on his work.Big Conspiracy is more introspective and subdued than its predecessor. The distorted vocals on Fortune Teller snarl, but there’s nothing here quite as upfront and raw as Common Sense’s Clartin. The lyrics, too, frequently suggest a man who’s had a considerable amount of time on his hands with not much to do but think. There’s a lot of contemplative stuff about knowing yourself – “how do you live your life when your life’s a facade?” he ponders, backed by melancholy piano chords, on Deeper Than Rap – and references to a grab-bag of spirituality that ranges from the aforementioned juju to Rastafarian ideas about the “Babylon system”. Then again, not everything on Big Conspiracy deals with an ascetic life of contemplation. There’s a fairly phenomenal amount of shagging involved too, not least on Play Play, his collaboration with Nigerian star Burna Boy.What hasn’t changed is his ability to switch between an array of musical styles – the Afrobeats-flavoured Love Peace and Prosperity Repeat’s collaboration with current dancehall queen Koffee the mesh of live guitar and bass that underpins Helicopter. More impressive still is that the album’s musical transitions never jar. As on his debut, they feel natural and unforced, an expression of growing up in London surrounded by an array of different cultural influences, tied together not just by J Hus’s flow, but his pop smarts – he has an unfailing ability to come up with earworm choruses. The latter skill is among his more overlooked, but it means that no matter how sombre his meditations on race, crime and identity get, virtually everything here feels like a single. The latest one is No Denying, and the ability to make something radio-friendly out of samples of high-tension soundtrack strings, scrabbling sax improv and ebombing bass is not to be sniffed at.When the news of the album’s leak initially broke, J Hus seemed to take it hard, announcing that if he couldn’t be in control of his own music, he might give up making it entirely and concentrate on developing his fashion line. After you hear Big Conspiracy, that seems very rash. For one thing, he sounds completely in control throughout. For another, it would be a waste: the charts are currently packed with British rappers, but not all of them have their own niche quite as clearly delineated as his. Big Conspiracy leaves you wanting to hear even more.Thundercat – Black QuallsAbetted by 80s soulgospel hero Steve Arrington, Thundercat’s return throws up rubber-limbed funk with a side-order of psychedelic weirdness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2763f0efa8c50f2ec6b8255405575b2fc09d7/62_582_1513_908/master/1513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb313e9571496990d6b5c3439fc2b017","title":"zoe brock my case against harvey weinstein podcast","story":"Like dozens of women in the entertainment industry, the actor, model and writer Zoë Brock has claimed she had a traumatic encounter with the film producer Harvey Weinstein.

Cases have been reported in the US, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong.However the World Health Organization’s emergency committee said on Thursday that it was “too early” to declare an international public health emergency over the outbreak.Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, said: “Make no mistake. This is an emergency in China. But it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.“I wish to reiterate, the fact that I am not declaring a public health emergency of international concern today should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious, or that we are not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth. WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.”Referring to the Scottish cases, Prof Jürgen Haas, the head of infection medicine at the University of Edinburgh, said he believed there would be many more in other parts of the UK.The Scottish patients all travelled from Wuhan, where the outbreak is thought to have originated, within the past two weeks and were showing symptoms of respiratory trouble – a red flag for the virus.A Scottish government spokesman said: “Following travel to Wuhan, China, two people confirmed as diagnosed with influenza are now being tested for Wuhan novel coronavirus as a precautionary measure only. Three further people are also undergoing testing on a similar precautionary basis.”Haas said there were “robust arrangements” in place to manage emerging diseases and they were monitoring the situation closely.He said the cases emerged overnight, adding: “The situation will be pretty similar in pretty much all UK cities with a large number of Chinese students. It’s not too surprising. My suspicion is that there will probably be many more cases in many other cities in the UK.”Haas said there was only one laboratory testing for the virus, operated by Public Health England, and that the cases had been flagged up through the PHE infection guidelines as the patients had travelled to Wuhan within the last 14 days and were showing signs of respiratory symptoms.Universities with links to China have issued warnings to staff and students travelling to and from areas affected by the coronavirus. Nine UK institutions have partnerships with Wuhan University in Hubei Province in central China, where the outbreak began.Earlier in the day, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, told MPs there was an increased likelihood that the coronavirus would arrive in the UK, but said the authorities were well prepared and would remain vigilant.It\u0027s a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. Antiviral drugs may be used, but usually only lessen the severity of symptoms.\u0026nbspChina’s health ministry has confirmed human-to-human transmission. As of 23 January the Chinese authorities had acknowledged 571 cases and 17 deaths. Those who have died are known to have been already in poor health - but mild cases may not be reported at all.There are fears that the coronavirus may spread more widely during the Chinese new year holidays at the end of January, when millions of people travel home to celebrate. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. But the authorities will be anxious that the virus will become more potent than so far appears and will be keen to stop the spread.Hancock told the Commons that the UK was one of a few countries to have developed a test for the latest coronavirus, so any suspected case could be diagnosed quickly. However, the symptoms do not develop for five to seven days, and sometimes even up to 14, meaning the virus can circulate undetected.The UK has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan, where all the deaths so far have occurred and which is now under lockdown by the Chinese authorities. While the UK has put in place measures to check passengers at Heathrow airport arriving from Wuhan, the Chinese government has stopped flights out of the city.“The chief medical officer has revised the risk to the UK population from very low to low and concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well-prepared and well-equipped to deal with them,” Hancock told MPs.Some people arriving on the last flight from Wuhan on Wednesday said they had not received any health checks at Heathrow, MPs pointed out. Handing out information was the key thing, Hancock replied. “The most important part of the monitoring is to ensure everybody knows what to do if the symptoms arise.” Several MPs said there were substantial numbers of Chinese students at universities in their constituencies. There was no specific advice for students, other than the general advice, Hancock said.“I’m very happy to take away the point that we will ensure we are communicating through Universities UK with all universities, to make sure the message gets to all students directly and they hear the advice that is there for everybody.” The Labour MP Hilary Benn asked what advice would be given to the public about the use of face masks, which they would see being used in China and elsewhere on the television. “People look at what people are doing in countries where the disease has taken hold and ask the authorities, ‘Why aren’t we doing the same?’” said Benn.Hancock replied: “The wearing of face masks is not deemed clinically necessary now, but we will keep that under review and will be guided by the science.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7039799b7c94b898158e1fcf9d73ed45559bea82/0_124_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc27f99944627a1159b3b83998a5db83","title":"space baked chocolate chip cookies","story":"Astronauts on the ISS baked chocolate chip cookies from raw ingredients for the first time although no one has yet tasted themThe results are finally in for the first chocolate chip cookie bake-off in space.While looking more or less normal, the best cookies required two hours of baking time last month up at the International Space Station. It takes far less time on Earth, under 20 minutes.And how do they taste? No one knows. Still sealed in inidual baking pouches and packed in their spaceflight container, the cookies remain frozen in a Houston-area lab after splashing down two weeks ago in a SpaceX capsule. They were the first food baked in space from raw ingredients.The makers of the oven expected a difference in baking time in space, but not that big.“There’s still a lot to look into to figure out really what’s driving that difference, but definitely a cool result,” Mary Murphy, a manager for Texas-based Nanoracks, said this week. “Overall, I think it’s a pretty awesome first experiment.”Located near Nasa’s Johnson Space Center, Nanoracks designed and built the small electric test oven that was launched to the space station last November. Five frozen raw cookies were already up there.Luca Parmitano, an Italian astronaut, was the master baker in December, radioing down a description as he baked them one by one in the prototype Zero G Oven.The first cookie – in the oven for 25 minutes at 300F (149C) – ended up seriously under-baked. He more than doubled the baking time for the next two, and the results were still so-so.The fourth cookie stayed in the oven for two hours, and finally: success.“So this time, I do see some browning,“ Parmitano radioed. “I can’t tell you whether it’s cooked all the way or not, but it certainly doesn’t look like cookie dough any more.”Parmitano cranked the oven up to its maximum 325F (163C) for the fifth cookie and baked it for 130 minutes. He reported more success.Additional testing is required to determine whether the three returned cookies are safe to eat.As for aroma, the astronauts could smell the cookies when they removed them from the oven, except for the first.That’s the beauty of baking in space, according to Mike Massimino, a former Nasa astronaut. He now teaches at Columbia University and is a paid spokesman for DoubleTree by Hilton. The hotel chain provided the cookie dough, the same kind used for cookies offered to hotel guests. It’s offering one of the space-baked cookies to the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum for display.“The reminder of home, the connection with home, I think, can’t be overstated,” Massimino said. “From my personal experience ... food is pretty important for not just nutrition but also for morale in keeping people connected to their home and their Earth.”Eating something other than dehydrated or prepackaged food will be particularly important as astronauts head back to the moon and on to Mars.Nanoracks and Zero G Kitchen, a New York City startup that collaborated with the experiment, are considering more experiments for the orbiting oven and possibly more space appliances. What’s in orbit now are essentially food warmers.There’s an added bonus of having freshly baked cookies in space.“We made space cookies and milk for Santa this year,” Nasa astronaut Christina Koch tweeted.

The capsule parachuted back to Earth, splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean at 1038 EST.The Nasa administrator, Jim Bridenstine, told the press conference afterwards that Crew Dragon had passed “another amazing milestone” and that more tests would happen before it could carry astronauts.

Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be 4,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 1,000 and 9,700.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and two other Chinese cities are in lockdown. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. A key concern is the range of severity of symptoms – some people appear to suffer only mild illness while others are becoming severely ill. This makes it more difficult to establish the true numbers infected and the extent of transmission between people. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and will be anxious that the virus could become more potent than it so far appears.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World Health Organization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Healthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.

china virus flu scotland testing wuhan live news updates","story":"Patient in Hebei has died possible cases in Scotland and Belfast come as World Health Organisation committee says ‘too early’ to declare emergencyAs the death toll from the new coronavirus climbs, questions remain about how it spread to humans and how much of a threat it poses across the world.Cases have been confirmed in the US, Japan, South Korea and Thailand, while there are understood to be at least fourteen suspected cases tested in the UK, with five confirmed negative.Now, fears are growing that the increased travel expected over the upcoming Lunar New Year period could aid the spread.But just how worried should we be in the UK?- How does this compare with previous outbreaks?Several experts say the new coronavirus appears to be less severe than its predecessors.Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said typical flu epidemics can kill tens of thousands of people, but that previous new coronavirus outbreaks have led to fewer deaths.For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) killed about 800 people, while Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) led to about 450 deaths.Prof Hunter said: “This new strain seems to be rather less lethal than the previous two outbreaks, however this could still change.“All new outbreaks are worrying, especially in the early weeks when it is not clear how the outbreak could progress.“I think it unlikely that the Wuhan coronavirus will cause a major public health issue in the UK, in large part because of our existing health system.”US researchers writing in the journal JAMA also said the fatality rate appears to be lower than that of Sars or Mers.The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday it was “too early” to declare a public health emergency of international concern.Dr Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University, said it is not clear how contagious the virus is.He said: “This is important in determining the risk of a much larger outbreak developing, with spread to people who have not travelled to Wuhan.“It is likely that the US and other countries will be considering what further measures are needed to limit the risk of more cases arriving from China.”- What is the risk to the UK?England’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, has revised the risk to the UK population from very low to low.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK is one of the first countries to develop a test for coronavirus and the NHS is ready to respond to any cases.He added: “The public can be assured that the whole of the UK is always well prepared for these type of outbreaks and we will remain vigilant and keep our response under constant review in light of emerging scientific evidence.”The Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan, but has not changed its advice on other destinations which have reported cases.- Could cases be confirmed in the UK?A handful of cases have been identified abroad, including in Japan and the US, but there have been no confirmed cases in the UK.Officials from Public Health England have been monitoring direct flights from Wuhan city to the UK.Professor Neil Ferguson, director of the Medical Research Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, said the UK is not a major destination of visitors travelling out of Wuhan.In addition, the screening will only catch people already showing symptoms.Dr Nathalie MacDermott, NIHR academic clinical lecturer, King’s College London, said: “It is wise to implement checks at this stage given the evidence on increasing spread of the virus to other countries and across continents, but largely for the purpose of being in contact with travellers from affected regions in case they become unwell.“If they were to be unwell at the airport or become unwell in the future it will allow more prompt isolation and testing of the patient, with appropriate tracing of any people the patient may have been in contact with.“This will hopefully limit the amount of people the person may have contact with while unwell and so limit the spread of the virus.”Japan’s health ministry said it had confirmed the country’s second case of a novel coronavirus strain in a man who travelled from Wuhan.In a statement, the ministry said the man in his 40s was a resident of the Chinese city where the outbreak began and arrived in Japan on January 19.He reported having had a fever for several days before his arrival but said his condition had stabilised by the time of his arrival in Japan.On January 22, he reported a fever and he is now in a Tokyo hospital receiving treatment, the ministry said.The statement added the man denied having visited the market in Wuhan identified as the source of the outbreak and said he had worn a medical mask while travelling.Fourteen people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus, Public Health England said.Five people tested negative and nine are still awaiting the results.A person in Australia has been quarantined and will undergo testing after being suspected of contracting the coronavirus, according to reports.The person was placed into quarantine in an unnamed hospital and will have tests on Friday, a New South Wales Ministry of Health spokesperson told news.au.The inidual arrived on a flight to Sydney. As the flight touched down, passengers and crew reportedly wore face masks and those who raised concerns about their health had their temperature taken.Authorities in Texas are investigating a second suspected case on US soil of the coronavirus virus, officials said. Brazos County, northwest of Houston, “is investigating a suspected case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),” officials wrote in a statement on Facebook.“The patient traveled from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus originated. “Health care providers were aware of public health guidance on novel coronavirus and quickly recognized that the patient met the criteria for coronavirus testing and is being kept isolated at home, while the precautionary testing is done.” A blood sample from the patient has to be tested at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) before the case if confirmed. If confirmed, the patient would be the second person to be infected with the virus in the US after a man in his 30s near Seattle reported himself to authorities on January 19. He is said to be recovering well and health officials have said he will be released soon.Martin Hibberd, Professor of Emerging Infectious Disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has given his view on the World Health Organisation not declaring the coronavirus outbreak a global emergency. He said: “This announcement is not surprising as more evidence may be needed to make the case of announcing a PHEIC.  “WHO were criticised after announcing the pandemic strain of novel H1N1_2009, when the virus was eventually realised to have similar characteristics to seasonal influenza and is perhaps trying to avoid making the same mistake here with this novel coronavirus.  “To estimate the true severity of this new disease requires identifying mild or asymptomatic cases, if there are any, while determining the human to human transmission rate might require more evidence.  “However, all this new evidence needs to be rapidly obtained over the next few days if the world is to be as prepared as possible, so WHO should issue a different type of alert to mobilise a full investigation.”Programmes to speed up the development of vaccines against coronavirus have received a funding boost.The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), partially financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, will fund three programmes with the aim being to advance nCoV-2019 vaccine candidates into clinical testing as quickly as possible.CEPI aims to develop vaccines for new and emerging diseases before they become global health emergencies.It said it has moved with great urgency to promote the development of new vaccines against the emerging threat of nCoV-2019, adding that the novel coronavirus represents the first new epidemic disease of note to emerge since CEPI’s founding at Davos in 2017.Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI, said: “Given the rapid global spread of the nCoV-2019 virus the world needs to act quickly and in unity to tackle this disease.“Our intention with this work is to leverage our work on the MERS coronavirus and rapid response platforms to speed up vaccine development.“There are no guarantees of success, but we hope this work could provide a significant and important step forward in developing a vaccine for this disease.“Our aspiration with these technologies is to bring a new pathogen from gene sequence to clinical testing in 16 weeks - which is significantly shorter than where we are now.”An 18th person in China has died from the virus.The 80-year-old man died in Hebei province, near the capital Beijing, on Wednesday.It is the first confirmed death outside Hubei province, in central China.  Dr Jeremy Farrar, a medical researcher and director of The Wellcome Trust, said it respects the advice of the World Health Organization’s Emergency Committee to not declare a global emergency but says this must be kept under constant review.He said: “Countries should act now on the recommendations made by the committee on how best to prepare and respond to this epidemic. There is no need to wait. “The decision does not change the fact that the urgent focus must remain on identifying the gaps in understanding of this virus, and on a continued robust, coordinated global public health response. “This outbreak and the speed with which this new virus has spread in China and travelled across borders, is a reminder of how vulnerable we are globally to outbreaks of infectious diseases known and unknown. “Travel restrictions may be important in buying time, to signal the seriousness of the situation and may help reduce the impact, but are unlikely stop this epidemic.”An Italian singer was hospitalised after showing “suspected symptoms’’ of the coronavirus including a cough and fever. She started feeling sick after returning home from a tour of Asia that included the area of Wuhan.Tests for the virus that infected the singer, who has not been named publicly, are proceeding. “The patient is currently in contact isolation at the Infectious Diseases Department,’’ a note from the hospital read.“She is receiving the necessary treatments pending test results’.”Universities across the UK say they are monitoring the coronavirus outbreak as one institution warned students thinking of heading home for the Chinese New Year that they would face being quarantined on their return.The University of Chester said it has notified its students currently in the UK that if they return to China for Chinese New Year they will not be readmitted without a suitable quarantine period. The University of Aberdeen, which has a partnership with Wuhan University, said it was not aware of any students in Wuhan - where the outbreak is thought to have originated - who have returned from the area recently. But a spokesman said: “The university is aware of five members of staff who have visited Wuhan during the outbreak, four of whom returned to the university three or more weeks ago. “The remaining member of staff has a non-teaching role and is working from home as a precautionary measure. “Advice regarding travel precautions has been issued to staff and students in line with Government guidance.” A Newcastle University spokesman said it had issued protection advice to around 300 students who have links to the Hubei province at the centre of the health scare, as well as offering support for those concerned. A spokesman said: “We have arranged a dedicated health event for any student arriving from China in the last month, ensuring they register with a doctor.” Universities have followed Foreign Office advice warning people not to travel to the region affected. A spokesman for the University of Dundee said it has issued advice to students recently in China and said they should be careful if receiving items, especially food, from areas where the virus is present. It runs a joint education partnership with Wuhan University, with 34 students on the programme in Dundee who arrived in September. Five staff returned from a visit to Wuhan last week, the spokesman added. He said no health concerns have been raised among either group, adding: “We will continue to monitor the situation, taking advice from the relevant agencies as to appropriate action.” A spokesman for the University of Nottingham, which has a campus in the Chinese city of Ningbo, said: “We are not aware of any staff or students in the affected areas in China. “However, the university is keeping students informed of the latest advice by UK and Chinese health authorities, including precautionary measures such as good hand and respiratory hygiene.”Top experts on infectious diseases held a hastily-arranged press conference on the Coronavirus at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier today.Jeremy Farrar, of the Wellcome Trust, gave reporters a swift explanation -- about how the virus probably jumped from bats to humans at a market in Wutan, before then starting to spread between humans. The fact the virus spreads between humans through the respiratory route makes it particularly serious, Farrar explained experts have been worrying about this happening for some time. Farrar said: “We want to keep a calm, moderated approach, but we need to take this incredibly seriously”. Farfer, who says he’s “very concerned” about the situation, also warned against thinking of it as a China-only problem.“This will become a global issue. This isn’t just a China issue, it’s going to affect us all.” Richard Hatchett, Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI), announced that three new partnerships with vaccine producers have just been agreed. “Our hope is to have these vaccines developed very rapidly and moved into human trials soon, maybe as soon as this summer,” Hatchett said. Hatchett and Farrar both spoke about the importance of using non-pharmaceutical interventions, until a vaccine is developed. That includes public health measures - hand-washing, keeping people apart, masks, and travel restrictions. Farrar’s hunch is that the coronavirus will have a lower mortality rate than the SARS epidemic 28 years ago, which killed 788 people. But if it spreads faster and further than SARS, and isn’t controlled in time, then the deathtoll could be higher than SARS. But there’s a lot of uncertainty. He reminded reporters that the influenza epidemic a century ago had a low mortality rate, but killed 50m people because it spread so far.Advice from the WHODr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation, said 584 cases have been reported to the WHO including 17 deaths, which is lower than the previously reported figure.Some 575 of the overall cases and all the deaths reported are in China. Other cases have been reported in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, the US and Vietnam.Ghebreyesus said it is known the virus can kill “although for most people it causes milder symptoms”, adding: “We know that among those infected, one quarter of patients have experienced severe disease. “We know that most of those who have died had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease that weakened their immune systems.“We know that there is human-to-human transmission in China, but for now it appears limited to family groups and health workers caring for infected patients.“At this time, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen.“There is still a lot we don’t know. We don’t know the source of this virus, we don’t understand how easily it spreads and we don’t fully understand its clinical features or severity.”Ghebreyesus added it is likely that we will see more cases in other parts of China and other countries.Peter Piot, professor of global health and director of the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, believes we are at a critical phase in the outbreak. He said: “Regardless of the decision not to declare this a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, intensified international collaboration and more resources will be crucial to stopping this outbreak in its tracks.  “National authorities and the World Health Organisation will need to continue to monitor developments very closely.“There are still many missing pieces in the jigsaw puzzle to fully understanding this new virus which is spreading rapidly across China, and most probably around the world.“The good news is that the data to date suggest that this virus may have a lower mortality than SARS, we have a diagnostic test and there is greater transparency than decades gone by.  “And that is essential because you cannot deal with a potential pandemic in one country alone.”The Boarding Schools Association (BSA) has issued guidance to its members that while there seems to be “no immediate cause for concern” over the coronavirus outbreak, the situation needs to be monitored carefully.It said: “In particular, schools might wish to consider planning for the eventuality that some boarders either cannot or choose not to travel home at half-term or, more likely, Easter.“BSA would advise schools to consider erring on the side of caution to minimise the risk to students and staff.”The guidance recommends that schools needing case-specific information contact the relevant public health authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/849eb328655d898fe035a173d3774bfc275f2735/0_81_1787_1072/master/1787.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8acd0eadd40bc9622d5bee413388e6c1","title":"a mountain of culture your guide to austrias ski juwel alpbachtal wildschonau","story":"If you’re looking to immerse yourself in the local customs and traditions of a new place while enjoying the slopes, Ski Juwel Alpbachtal Wildschönau in the Austrian region of Tirol has plenty to offerWhen it comes to skiing holidays, you won’t find me battling down a black run in a blizzard or getting up at dawn to carve fresh tracks on virgin powder. But atmosphere is something I am choosy about I want to go somewhere that has charm and character, somewhere that has life both on and off the piste. Just a 45-minute drive from Innsbruck, the Wildschönau and Alpbach valleys tick all of those boxes. Steeped in Tirolean culture, the mountains are dotted with pretty villages, handsome wooden farmhouses, onion dome churches and a great choice of family-run hotels and restaurants serving up hearty Austrian fare. And it’s good value too, making it an ideal choice for families and first-timers.SkiingThe Ski Juwel Alpbachtal Wildschönau is one of the larger ski regions in the Tirol, with 68 miles of pistes. At its heart are two mountains, the Wiedersbergerhorn (2,128m) and the Schatzberg (1,903m), which are linked by cable car. Between them they can cater for most levels of skier, but families and novice skiers will particularly appreciate the wide, gentle nursery slopes around the villages of Inneralpbach and Niederau. Intermediate skiers can take their pick from a variety of attractive, meandering runs, such as the 2.5 mile tree-lined run that sweeps down from the Pöglbahn station towards Inneralpbach. Those in search of more challenging terrain will find some rewarding black runs and off-piste skiing above Niederau and at the top of the Wiedersbergerhorn. There are two snow parks where boarders and skiers can work on their tricks, and you can try night skiing at the Reither Kogel, whose slopes are floodlit every Friday and Saturday from Christmas until the beginning of March.Where to stayThe villages of the Wildschönau and Alpbachtal valleys offer a perfect antidote to bland purpose-built resorts. For chocolate-box Tirolean charm, few places can rival Alpbach, which has been voted Austria’s “prettiest village”. New for this ski season is Die Alpbacherin, a four-star boutique hotel with smart rooms, a spa, infinity pool and restaurant specialising in regional food. If you want to be right on the slopes, the hamlet of Inneralpbach, a little higher up the valley, is a good option, with a smattering of family-friendly hotels, a small microbrewery and direct access to the lifts. Niederau is perfect for first-time skiers, with a string of good-value family-run hotels, many of which are a short walk to the slopes. We enjoyed the warm hospitality and excellent home-cooked food of the Wastlhof hotel in Niederau, which has spotless rooms and a great indoor pool and spa. The hotel recently opened a new wing across the road with family-friendly apartments overlooking the ski slopes.Where to eat and après-skiIf downing shots and dancing into the small hours is your idea of après-ski heaven then you might want to look elsewhere. The scene here is lowkey: think cosy mountain huts serving locally-brewed beers and hearty meals brought to your table by lederhosen-clad waiters. This is dairy farming country so cheese and cream get star billing on menus. I still daydream about the brezensuppe (pretzel soup) I tasted in the Gasthaus Thalmühle in Oberau – a rich beef broth laced with pretzels and topped with melted cheese and fried onions. Another great place to try out regional specialities is the Böglalm hut in Alpbach. On sunny winter afternoons skiers queue for schnitzel and spazln (the Austrian answer to gnocchi) cooked up in huge pans on outdoor stoves. Wash it down, like the locals do, with a shot of krautinger schnapps, which is distilled from turnips and which only a handful of families in the Wildschönau valley are licensed to make.Things to doWhen you tire of hurtling down the slopes on skis or a board, you can hurtle down them on a toboggan – there are runs in Niederau and Auffach. Or you can buckle up for a ride on the Alpbachtaler Lauser-Sauser – an Alpine coaster that gives the thrill of high-speed sledging on rails. Learn how to drive a piste basher at Reith im Alpbachtal or to build an igloo in Niederau. The Alpbachtal Seenland card and the Wildschönau card offers lots of discounts and benefits, including unlimited travel on the ski bus, free guided snowshoe walks and free use of the cross-country ski trails.Find out more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/251b5a3161ba1ef48984dbf7096f211b6ba20c22/0_278_5477_3286/master/5477.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e09cf67aec4de76ea5d2068a0d3c6b7c","title":"england south africa wanderers pace vic marks","story":"A sense of eager anticipation is justified when a Test match is at the Wanderers. Stuff happens: a bouncy pitch excites fast bowlers as it did Allan Donald (in 1999), and Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel (2010). Some batsmen revel in the extra pace such as Marcus Trescothick and Herschelle Gibbs (2005) as the humidity increases and thunderstorms threaten, the ball can swing as it did for Matthew Hoggard (2005) wickets can fall in quick succession as for Stuart Broad (2016) and yet it is stillpossible for there to be a heroic rearguard action on a monumental scale (Michael Atherton, 1995).Since South Africa’s re-entry the tally stands at two wins per side at the Wanderers plus the AthertonJack Russell inspired draw. For there to be another draw in the fourth Test quite a lot of rain will have to fall, which is a possibility. More likely there will be a shootout with the pace bowlers to the fore on a well-grassed pitch that seldom disappoints.Neither captain was able to finalise their XI on the eve of the match. They will wait to look at the pitch, the weather forecast and, in the case of England, the fitness of their pacemen.Faf du Plessis did confirm one change: Temba Bavuma replaces Zubayr Hamza, which means Rassie van der Dussen, an adhesive presence in this series despite his white-ball prowess, will move up to No 3.Du Plessis could not say much else. Having been replaced as the one-day captain by Quinton de Kock, initially without any explanation as if he had not been leading the one-day side for the past three years, he declined to look beyond this Test, which is likely to be his last at home it may be his last anywhere.The optimism generated by the victory at Centurion has dissipated rapidly – almost to the extent some South Africans seem to have forgotten that a win can level the series, which would be no disgrace.England are now the favourites to prevail but anything is possible even though South Africa will be denied the presence of their star bowler, Kagiso Rabada, whose celebration of Joe Root’s dismissal in Port Elizabeth, earned him a fateful demerit point to add to the list. For the spectator his absence is a shame since Rabada roaring in at the Wanderers is well worth watching.Without Rabada South Africa’s likeliest match-winner is Vernon Philander, who is playing his 64th and final Test. The Wanderers should suit him rather more than the sluggish surface at Port Elizabeth and this time there is no reason for Du Plessis to restrict his use on the grounds he wants to save him for another day.Philander, 34, has been a wonderful throwback. In the 21st century it is very rare to find an opening bowler in Test cricket who barely bowls at 80mph but such is the magic in his wrist and fingers that if there is movement for the new ball, Philander will find it. He has taken 222 wickets at 22.29 in Test cricket. His batting average is higher than that (24.51), which means he can be regarded as a formidable all-rounder. Next summer he heads to Somerset as a Kolpak cricketer, one of the last ones since new Kolpaks will not be permitted after next July, which will be a much-needed relief to South African cricket.Root must decide how many pacemen to play at the Wanderers and who will be the most effective. Especially if the forecast suggests rain interruptions and gloomy conditions they are expected to dispense with their spinner, even though Dom Bess was so successful in Port Elizabeth.In 1995 and 1999 England made do with Graeme Hick and Michael Vaughan providing semi-professional spin in 2005, 2010 and 2016 they had Ashley Giles, Graeme Swann and Moeen Ali respectively. None of them managed to take more than two wickets in an innings.Root himself may decide to take on the burden of providing the spin option with a little help from Joe Denly. The statistics now suggest – as does the naked eye – that Root can, at least, be regarded as a superior bowler to Hick and Vaughan.Mark Wood and Jofra Archer are unlikely to play in the same side, which would be a shame. Moreover Chris Woakes, a blameless spectator throughout this series, could yet be drafted into the side if doubts about the fitness of Wood or Archer remain.There will be much justifiable sympathy for Bess if he is omitted but it is infinitely preferable to be left out after taking six wickets for 87 runs in your previous Test rather than 0 for 110. Come what may his stock has risen rapidly on this tour and he is guaranteed a trip to Sri Lanka, which will surely include a place in the final XI in Galle in two months’ time.Win toss..and bat (probably). There is grass but there should be pace throughout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49c1c4b1254b155e344af606ee32969dfb77dfcf/0_387_3485_2091/master/3485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6f6e188841d69eb3356e0250f22bb4f","title":"the best of the winter youth olympic games in pictures","story":"All the colour, drama and skill of the competitors are captured here in the best photographs from Lausanne"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bca5a6a6fa519bd00abec74a08d3e6b26f09c462/0_93_4136_2483/master/4136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed134f061eebdd1b672e3e56a5da7b52","title":"australian open 2020 day five live","story":"First set: Barty* 3-2 Rybakina (*denotes server): An ace and some more magical backhand slicing sees Barty once again go up 30-0 on serve. Rybakina finds a winner to narrow the margin but Barty keeps her at arm’s length with an unreturnable serve. Game point is a long methodical affair and eventually the Kazakhstani finds the net. After five games we have the first service hold. Barty in front for the first time in the match. First set: Barty 2-2 Rybakina* (*denotes server): Rybakina begins her latest service game with an ace followed by a double fault in a neat summation of the match so far. She slices a backhand into the net for 15-30 but when she returns to her huge forehand she quickly levels the score. That shot is a heck of weapon, consistently putting Barty on the defensive. The Australian does defend brilliantly, lobbing her way imaginatively out of trouble, but she misses her mark when the opportunity presents itself to strike the winner. Rybakina can’t capitalise though, erring without provocation to gift Barty deuce.The first deuce point is superb, both players hammering forehands from corner to corner, Barty covering down the line then nailing that backhand slice to set up the winner. Rybakina hits straight back then enjoys another game point after Barty returns long. She can’t take it though, and concedes a break point of her own after missing a forehand drive volley. And Barty secures the fourth break of the match! All the spins and slices on display in the vital point from the Queenslander, bamboozling her opponent. First set: Barty* 1-2 Rybakina (*denotes server): Barty is easing into her work now, cruising to 30-0 and looking fluid on both flanks. A lovely running backhand winner brings Rybakina back into the game and she steps up another level with a brilliant drop shot from the baseline that catches Barty off guard following a long precise rally that showed both women in excellent touch. Another rally goes Rybakina’s way when Barty tugs a forehand wide, but she saves break point with an ace right on the stem of the T. The 29th seed quickly earns another break point with a rasping return winner - and she seals it on the second attempt with a couple of massive forehands into the right corner eventually proving too strong for her Australian opponent. All three games have gone against serve so far but the standard of tennis is high. First set: Barty 1-1 Rybakina* (*denotes server): Barty gives no indication her opening game will have any lasting effect, racing to 0-40 with a string of points including a superb forehand winner. Rybakina nails a serve to grab a point back but Barty secures the immediate break back. First set: Barty* 0-1 Rybakina (*denotes server): In perfect conditions on centre court Rybakina begins strongly, controlling the opening point from the baseline before striking a crosscourt forehand winner. Very uncharacteristically Barty then dumps a hat-trick of unforced errors into the net to concede her opening service game to love! Rybakina looks assured out there, striking her shots from the baseline very deep, restricting Barty’s ability to execute her trademark backhand slice. If you’re interested in that kind of thing, Barty, the No 1 seed, is currently third-favourite for the title, behind Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka.Ash Barty walks out to warm applause around Rod Laver Arena. And here comes her opponent, Elena Rybakina. She will be no pushover today. The 29th-seeded Kazakhstan representative (she formerly competed under the Russian flag) has already won the Hobart International this season, and at just 20-years-old she is on a rapid rise to the top. This is already her best performance at a grand slam. Rybakina is tall and broad, and she uses that frame to good effect on serve. She is currently second only to Karolina Pliskova for aces sent down this season so far. This pair have never met before in competition. Missed anything from yesterday or overnight? Fear not.After a topsy-turvy few weeks in south-eastern Australia featuring ash-laden smog, golf ball sized hailstones, and gale-force winds, the forecast is settled for the next week or so. Today will be cool (17-23C) and mostly sunny with a westerly breeze causing flags to flutter but hopefully not interfere with play. Thereafter the forecast is for warm dry days with the temperature ramping up into more familiar Aus Open territory towards the back end of next week. Days at the tennis don’t come much better than this. First out on Rod Laver Arena is home favourite and world number one Ash Barty, up against rising star Elena Rybakina. Serena Williams will then look to continue her impressive form against 27th-seeded Wang Qiang. Novak Djokovic rounds the session off as clear favourite against Japanese outsider Yoshihito Nishioka.We’ll also be keeping an eye on Margaret Court Arena where a host of even seed v seed contests are taking place. While over on Melbourne Arena, Lleyton Hewitt is in action early in the doubles before Caroline Wozniacki again bids to delay her retirement. Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of day five of the Australian Open. Today marks the start of round three in the singles draws and action will be underway at 11am.Our attention will focus on Rod Laver Arena where a mouth-watering schedule offers first world No 1 Ash Barty, then 23-time grand slam champion Serena Williams, followed by the current holder of the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup, Novak Djokovic. There will be updates from around the Melbourne Park precinct with the likes of Petra Kvitova and Caroline Wozniacki also in action.It’s been a remarkably stable tournament to date. For the first time since 2007 the top ten seeds in the women’s singles are all through to round three, while only two of the top-16 seeds in the men’s singles have suffered upsets. That means every contest from hereon is likely to be much harder to call as the last-32 in each draw is packed with big match pedigree.If you want to join in at any point throughout the day, you can reach me by email: jonathan.howcroft.casual@the or Twitter: @JPHowcroft."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8abb307176386d4d50b874e6938fcb37ac36b303/0_141_3148_1889/master/3148.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b3378fcbb9eca50cf386899a55af0d3","title":"uncle vanya review harold pinter theatre london toby jones","story":"Harold Pinter theatre, LondonIan Rickson’s exquisite production is enlivened with expertly weighted humour and a modern beatLast year, David Hare teamed up with Rupert Everett to stage an Uncle Vanya that drew much humour from out of the gloom. Everett claimed Chekhov wrote it as a comedy and played his buffoonish Vanya for laughs. What does Conor McPherson bring to this new adaptation? A different kind of laughter, it turns out: deeper, more poignant and perfectly weighted.Ian Rickson’s exquisite production is full of energy despite the play’s prevailing ennui. It does not radically reinvent or revolutionise Chekov’s 19th-century story. It returns us to the great, mournful spirit of Chekhov’s tale about unrequited love, ageing and disappointment in middle-age, while giving it a sleeker, modern beat.McPherson’s script has a stripped, vivid simplicity which quickens the pace of the drama, and despite its contemporary language – Vanya swears and uses such terms as “wanging on” – it does not grate or take away from the melancholic poetry.Rae Smith’s set is a thing of beauty which raises the theme of environmental damage visually rather than having the modern-day resonances spelled out more crudely in the script. This sitting room contains all the faded grandeur of the household. Garden foliage climbs into the room through the open door and windows, as if nature were reaching into this manmade space, serving as a subtle visual backdrop to the climate message.Richard Armitage, as Dr Astrov, speaks of his love of nature and the dangers of deforestation, but he does so with an ardour that is metabolised fully into character. Toby Jones’s Vanya is a vaguely dissolute type in sunglasses whose shirt is always untucked. He is variously ridiculous, self-pitying, and made to look a fool by his unrequited passion for Professor Serebryakov’s young wife, Yelena (Rosalind Eleazar). But Jones brings a tortured truth to the role that renders him eminently likeable, even in these moments, and he never fails to move us.His rages against the pomposity of the professor and his academic achievements have a tone that suggest he secretly hates his own failure. “I could have been another Schopenhauer, a Dostoevsky,” he says, and it is both funny in its echoes of Brando’s “I coulda been a contender” and a middle-aged moment of reckoning filled with nostalgia and pathos.Armitage plays Astrov as a romantic idealist while Eleazar emanates the indolent boredom of Yelena, but shows what lies beneath in a sudden, volcanic eruption of passion with Astrov. Aimee Lou Wood is a goofy but lovable Sonya, also in love with Astrov, and painfully aware of her limitations. Every character is fully realised, including the ancillary roles that bring more than comic relief.“God will smile on us,” says Sonya, as the household steps back from the brink of despair at the end, and it is the perfectly bittersweet ending to a perfect tragicomedy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5ce39d227d831c434210cdf35977916f8f876e/0_0_5124_3073/master/5124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e00d6b308231638bc427a46750c8d36","title":"tell us about the websites your children visit","story":"We want to hear from parents and young adults about the non-mainstream sites they and their children accessWith new rules for technology companies to protect children online announced by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, we want to hear about the non-mainstream sites children and young people access.Some of these principles include:We want to know about the surprising sites that children and young people visit.

The retreat specialises in improving diet and resting the digestive system. There are lots of skilled practitioners on hand, offering extra treatments such as Tibetan bowl therapy and deep tissue massage. The place is in lovely countryside close to the sea.

Vitosha is a great place for hiking and alpine fun and there’s the Boyana waterfall a couple of hours’ hike away – good for your lungs and your waistline. I usually either walk up the mountain and take in the fresh air or hire a mountain bike and do a few of the routes in the area. You can cycle into Sofia via the National Theatre park route or head up into the forest. After all this activity, the free spa access at the hotel is most welcome!

But in Latvia there’s no special term for it. “We don’t need one – this is just normal behaviour for Latvians,” said Sigita Klētniece, our walk leader in a crisp, cold Gauja national park in the country’s north-east.We stood and breathed deeply, as light dappled through the snow-speckled pines. “Let being in the forest relax you,” said Sigita. “Listen to the sounds and sense nature around you.”It felt like the forest was a spiritual place, where Latvians came to meditate.My own foray into these immense woodlands was a four-day tour of the Vidzeme region, which covers central and northern Latvia. Despite being home to the capital, Riga, Vidzeme is characterised by forest, rolling hills (including Mount Gaiziņš, Latvia’s highest point at 311 metres), morainal lakes, the cliff-lined Gauja River and historic towns with medieval castles. It is a proud region, known as the “cradle of Latvian culture” for its rich artistic heritage.I was on a short small group tour of the country with guide Amanda Kokoreviča of Experience Baltics. The forest was captivating: quiet trails among soaring trees and abundant wildlife. Equally fascinating were the people we met: the local pioneers using Latvia’s forest to create a new wave of green tourism and eco-friendly business.Latvia’s tourism board is fully behind this shift. It wants to encourage visitors away from Riga, which is popular with both rowdy British stag-dos and city breakers enticed by the medieval old town and art nouveau architecture. It wants tourists to use Riga as a launch pad for trips into Latvia’s green lands for bird-watching, forest hiking and bog walks.“It’s such a shame many tourists are in a mad rush, visiting Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania in just a few days,” said Amanda, as we arrived at Mālpils , a classical 19th-century manor with baroque-style grounds and now a design hotel and restaurant. “But things are changing – people are becoming more interested in Latvia’s nature.”The next day, after lunch at stylish Cafe Zeit, housed in a former Soviet factory, we arrived at the Woodcraft Museum in the riverside village of Līgatne. Ponytailed proprietor Rihards demonstrated how he makes bowls using locally harvested wood and traditional techniques. Even the peppermint leaves floating in my tea cup were from the local woods.Forest foraging is almost a national sport in Latvia, with mushrooms, berries, herbs, leaves for tea and birch sap juice on the menu. With half of the nation’s forests state-owned, and favourable public access laws, filling your basket is completely legal. Families are even permitted to take one Christmas tree from the forest every December. As we checked in that evening at HE Vanadziņš – a contemporary restaurant and hotel next to Cēsis’s old town – I wondered whether the owner had personally felled the tree decorating the reception.“My grandmother taught me how to forage,” said Sigita the following day, as we set off on foot past sandstone cliffs into Gauja national park – the oldest and largest of the four in Latvia. “And we pass on that knowledge and passion to our children.”Sadly we had missed the August-October mushroom season, but the forest still provided. While we picked wild cranberries, a family with a young daughter collected pine cones for a Christmas wreath and others filled large containers with spring water. This closeness to the forest is rooted in Latvia’s history: for centuries the forest has represented safety and security for Latvians, particularly in the 1600s and 1700s when people fled to the woods during conflicts between the Russian, German and Swedish empires.That afternoon, as we explored the towns of Cēsis and Valmiera, the Latvian love of nature was still clear. At Valmiermuiža brewery a “forest cola” – made with cranberries, pine blossom and heather – was lauded as a new children’s drink, while at Veikaliņš, a pop-up shop selling handcrafted produce from 35 creatives, the shelves were stocked with items such as biodegradable reed straws and textiles made from recycled linen.“Thanks to the younger generation, more and more Latvians are buying ethically sourced, eco-friendly goods,” said Lelde, the shop’s founder.Jānis, a moustachioed ice-cream maker from near Dunte, echoed this when we visited his farm. “Latvians love local produce,” he told us, as we tucked in to his Gogelmogels ice-cream. He gets milk from his neighbour’s cows, eggs from his own chickens, and flavourings such as sea buckthorn and bee pollen from his fields.Later I headed for the sauna at Lantus, a farmhouse where guests can experience a traditional Latvian bathing ritual. This turned out to be a part-aromatherapy part-massage treatment: the masseur covered my face with pungent eucalyptus leaves before pummeling my body with leafy twigs of birch and oak.Half an hour later I emerged from the sauna, covered in leaf fragments. “Your body and soul should feel cleansed,” said Amanda, glowing from her own treatment. That sums up what the forest means to Latvians. • The trip was provided by the Investment and Development Agency of Latvia (latvia.travel).

Seismic activity in Britain is rarely strong enough to knock even a picture off the wall, so no one is on alert for “the big one”.This might help explain why Britons react with such shock and good humour when earthquakes do strike, as they did on Teesside on Thursday morning when a 3.0 magnitude quake hit a suburb of Stockton-on-Tees.We should not be quite so surprised. According to the British Geological Survey, about 20 earthquakes which are strong enough to feel occur each year in the UK.The biggest earthquake to hit in the UK in the past 36 years was a 5.2 magnitude quake in Market Rasen in Lincolnshire in 2008.The worst damage reported was a collapsed chimney and a cross falling off the church. But the imagination of a resident, Adrian Campbell, ran wild. “We went to see a film last week about a giant lizard loose in New York, and I honestly started to wonder if something like that had come for us,” he told the  at the time.The quake prompted some other vivid descriptions. Kirstie Silson, who was 16 at the time, said: “You know that noise radiators sometimes make? Well, ours was making it, but it was shaking and dust was flying off it as well.”Similar domestic imagery was used to explain what it felt like to experience a 3.5 magnitude aftershock in Rutland in April 2014. “It really rattled the doors of my shower!” said Dave Stevens from Oakham.Just over a year later a 3am quake measuring 4.3 sparked some surreal dreams in Kent.“Either a giant just bounced on my roof, or I just felt a little earthquake,” tweeted a musician, Jake West, from Canterbury. He added: “It was very odd. It felt like there was someone very heavy who was stomping down the stairs.”A 4.4 magnitude earthquake in south Wales briefly stopped a Welsh League football match between Port Talbot and Taff’s Well.A 3.9-magnitude earthquake in June 2018 made Grimsby the focus of shocking jokes such as this one:Last month’s 3.2 magnitude tremor in Somerset made the windows shake in Taunton, Siobhan Pestano from Langport said: “It briefly felt like somebody had dropped a bit of Stonehenge on the house.”Another Somerset resident said: “My ears were ringing. Smaller objects in the house were moving. Our wifi cut out and the dog was going crazy. Absolutely amazing.”The 3.0 Teesside tremor occurred a day after Jessie Jacobs launched her campaign to become Tees Valley’s Labour metro mayor. “I said I wanted to come into politics to shake things up,” she joked."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Gript\u0026rsquos arrangement with Cambridge-Analytica-linked business is under scrutinyAssembly Commission determined it was not legally possible to prevent the pay increaseJury make six recommendations to garda\u0026iacute at inquest of man who killed Jastine ValdezChairman of Legal Aid Board says income thresholds for support should be reviewedChairman of Property Services Appeal Board Anthony Ensor ceased practising as solicitorA Labour voter, Sue Redmond is thinking of switching to Sinn F\u0026eacutein due to pension reformLocals have been opposing plans by developer Crevkav to build the units on the landHealth officials claim there is low likelihood of cases of the virus occurring in IrelandCandidates try to avoid campaigns going up in smoke while country is king in MayoGript site, which is backed by anti-abortion lobby, says AggregateIQ is helping to \u0026lsquoprofile\u0026rsquo readersGroup call on politicial parties to commit to extra funding to address \u0026lsquocrisis\u0026rsquoLargest union wants age of State pension to revert to 65, and that a forum discuss the \u0026lsquowhite hot\u0026rsquo election issueVerdict of natural causes recorded at inquest where father recalls son saying \u0026lsquoAll the best\u0026rsquoParty proposes \u0026lsquovastly improving entitlement to parental leave and flexible work options\u0026rsquoSoc Dems TD says potential for centre-left government, but is unlikely this election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4149501.1579815882!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"donegal poll finds sinn f%C3%A9in may take seat from independent or fianna f%C3%A1il","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty: he may receive a quota and a half in Donegal. Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill  The It comes as retiring Independents predict the election will be difficult for non-aligned candidates. The number of Independents running in this election is down on the last general election in 2016, when 159 stood. There are about 115 Independent candidates running across the country in the February 8th election, representing just over a fifth of all contenders.The poll conducted for TG4 by IpsosMRBI found Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty is likely to receive a quota and a half, with 27 per cent of first preference votes. Fine Gael’s Joe McHugh is in second place at 17 per cent of first preference votes. Mr MacLochlainn, on 12 per cent, could regain the seat he lost in the 2016 general election from Mr Doherty’s surplus. There remains a possibility Fianna Fáil could win two seats in the five-seater constituency, where the party’s candidates are Charlie McConalogue, on 12 per cent in the poll, and Pat “The Cope” Gallagher, on 10 per cent.The last seat looks like a battle for transfers between one of the Fianna Fáil candidates and Mr Pringle, on 6 per cent.Independent Peter Casey got 2 per cent in the poll, and Green candidate Michael White recorded 4 per cent.The poll was conducted on Monday and Tuesday. A sample of 550 attaches a margin of error of up to plus or minus four percentage points. Martin Harley of Fine Gael got 3 per cent Aontú’s Mary T Sweeney 3 per cent Independent John O’Donnell 4 per cent and Independent Niall McConnell 1 per cent. It is one of a series of three polls that TG4 is carrying out in the Gaeltacht constituencies of Donegal, Galway West and Kerry. Left alliance Meanwhile, a retiring Independent TD has said he would like to see unaligned TDs on the left come together with like-minded parties to form a broad left alliance. Outgoing Dublin Bay North TD Tommy Broughan said his ambition in politics was always to make the Labour Party capable of being the majority party in a coalition.Mr Broughan, who lost the Labour Party whip in 2011 after voting against the then government on the bank guarantee, said unaligned TDs could miss the discipline of a political party. “I had a party discipline for so long,” he said. “You miss all of that.”In the 32nd Dáil, Mr Broughan, first elected as a TD in 1992, was part of a group of Independents which included Mr Pringle, Galway West’s Catherine Connolly and Maureen O’Sullivan, who is also standing down as a TD for Dublin Central at this election. Ms O’Sullivan followed in the tradition of Tony Gregory, who held an Independent seat between February 1982 and his death in 2009.Mr Broughan said his ambition was always to get Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael out of government, or at least relegate them to the status of junior coalition partners. Difficult Finian McGrath, also stepping down as an Independent for Dublin Bay North, predicted this election will be difficult for those who are not standing for political parties. “It is going to be very difficult for Independents and particularly new Independents starting off,” said the Minister of State for Disability Issues.“There is a swing to some of the bigger parties like Sinn Féin and the Greens and a swing back to Fianna Fáil. I do think there will be a group of Independents elected, and I hope some of the group will have the bottle to go into government and don’t sit on the fence.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4149378.1579805092!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 outtakes absent mary lou comes out on top","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Leader Mary Lou McDonald at Sinn Féin’s general election candidate launch in the Mansion House, Dublin.

So, there really will be no joint administration.Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell told Newstalk she “smoked some cannabis” when at university but said she had “never taken a chemical synthetic drug”.As a pharmacist, she “fully understands the difficulties but also the safety aspect,” she added.The Green Party’s Pippa Hackett said she smoked cannabis while at college and Sinn Féin’s health spokeswoman Louise O’Reilly also confessed to using it in the past.– Varadkar declines to detail what type of illegal drugs he may have taken in the past.The number of constituencies in which businessman Seán O’Leary, from Kerry Pike in Cork, has declared as a general election candidate. The total deposit to register in the five Dublin constituencies, five Cork constituencies as well as one in Kerry comes to €5,500.Fine Gael’s Michelle Mulherin has inadvertently reported her director of elections to the gardaí, it appears.After 40 of her posters were removed in Kilkelly near Knock, Co Mayo, this week, the Senator called in the cops.But Tom Garvey, the law and order party’s electoral director in the county, told Midwest Radio that the posters were lawfully removed on his instruction.Significant analysis had gone into carving up the constituency between the party’s three candidates in an attempt to maximise votes, and posters could only be erected in each candidate’s “internally agreed” areas, he said.Mayo puts country before all elseFears abounded in former taoiseach Enda Kenny’s heartland that the election count would scupper a hooley at Castlebar’s Royal Theatre.Midwest Radio’s sold-out Night with the Stars – featuring Mike Denver, Declan Nerney and Dominick Kirwan – has been long billed for February 10th.With the count starting in the same venue the day before, a sweat was on as to whether it would be concluded in time for the big show.Management was forced to issue a statement to The Connaught  reassuring fans that contingencies are in place.

In a letter to the Assembly Speaker from the five parties represented on the Assembly Commission following a meeting on Thursday, they said they had agreed that “inflationary increases to MLA salaries and any salary increase should not be retained by MLAs until the review of the work of the Independent Financial Review Panel (IFRP) is completed or until the end of the mandate.”They also said it was “vital to protect the principle that MLA salaries should be determined independently and not by MLAs.”The £1000 pay rise came into effect following a determination by the IFRP in 2016. It was part of an annual uprating, and should have been awarded in £500 increments in 2018 and 2019, had the Assembly been sitting.The uprating - which raises MLAs’ total salary to £50,500 per year - automatically came into force once the Assembly was restored. Their salaries are due to rise by a further £500 in April.Many MLAs had expressed their opposition to the pay increase, which they said was unjustified. A number, including all of the SDLP’s MLAs, had already said they would donate the money to charity. In the letter, which was signed by the DUP, Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Ulster Unionist Party and Alliance, they said that at the meeting of the Assembly Commission they “recognised the understandable public concern in relation to the payment of inflationary increases to MLA salaries and used the opportunity to clarify a number of points in relation to the legal position. “As was noted, no MLA or party sought or has supported an increase in MLA salaries and the inflationary increases arise automatically from the 2016 Determination by the Independent Financial Review Panel. “It was also noted the 2018 Determination introduced by the then Secretary of State Karen Bradley preserved the inflationary increases but suspended them until an Executive was formed. “Therefore, following the appointment of Ministers to the Executive, the inflationary increases automatically took effect and the Assembly Commission is legally required to pay them to MLAs. We acknowledge that the Assembly Commission has no legal discretion in implementing the inflationary increases.” The Speaker, Alex Maskey, said that following “my meeting with representatives from the five parties on the Assembly Commission this afternoon, I have received a joint position from those parties. “I am encouraged by the constructive cooperation which the parties have shown to deal resolutely with this difficult issue.”The SDLP chief whip Colin McGrath said the commission had been unable to stop the rise being implemented. “That money is going to come to us, that is set in law,” he said. “But the parties have worked hard together today and have now set in stone a process which will enable us to give that money back.” He said a new salary review panel was due to be constituted. Should it not make any determinations before the end of this mandate, Mr McGrath said, “each of the increases that come in on the first of April will move into this scheme, so there will be extra money for charities or extra money for the public purse. It is unjustifiable at this stage that it goes to MLAs,” he said.

Photograph: STRVietnam News AgencyAFP via Getty ImagesFour people in Scotland are being tested for suspected coronavirus and another person is being treated for for symptoms associated with the illness in Belfast.A man, who had recently arrived from China, presented at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast with symptoms which could be linked to the virus.He was isolated as a precaution and is believed to be responding well to treatment.The Belfast Health Trust said it could not comment due to patient confidentiality.The news follows confirmation on Thursday that four people in Scotland are being tested for suspected coronavirus after travelling to the country from Wuhan, China.Professor Jurgen Haas, the head of infection medicine at the University of Edinburgh, said he believes there will be many more cases from other cities in the UK.Eighteen people have died, and more than 630 have been infected, mostly in China.However, the emergency committee of the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday evening it was “too early” to declare an international public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak.Prof Haas said three of the suspected cases in Scotland were in Edinburgh and the other was believed to be in Glasgow.Tests are currently being carried out and none of the patients have been confirmed as having the disease.They all travelled to Scotland from Wuhan, where the outbreak is thought to have originated, within the past two weeks and are showing symptoms of respiratory trouble, a red flag for the virus.The WHO held a meeting of scientific experts on Thursday to consider whether a co-ordinated international response was required.“It is a bit too early to consider that this is a public health emergency of international concern,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva, adding that the organisation’s Emergency Committee of 16 independent experts had been ided in its conclusion.“Make no mistake, though, this is an emergency in China. But it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.”Chinese authorities moved to isolate three cities that are home to more than 18 million people in an unprecedented effort to contain the deadly new virus that has sickened hundreds and spread to other parts of the world during the busy Lunar New Year travel period.Police, Swat teams and paramilitary troops guarded Wuhan’s railway station, where metal barriers blocked the entrances at 10am.Only travellers holding tickets for the last trains out were allowed to enter.Normally bustling streets, shopping centres, restaurants and other public spaces in the city of 11 million people were eerily quiet.In addition to shutting down the railway station, authorities closed the airport and halted ferry, underground and bus service.The city made no mention of a ban on private vehicles leaving but one resident told Reuters she could not drive out of the city because guards were blocking the entrance to a highway she hoped to drive on. Authorities have advised residents not to leave the city.Authorities announced similar measures would take effect on Friday in the nearby cities of Huanggang and Ezhou.In Huanggang, theatres, internet cafes and other entertainment centres were also ordered closed.In the capital, Beijing, authorities cancelled “major events” indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of holiday celebrations, in order to “execute epidemic prevention and control”.Wuhan connection“To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,” Gauden Galea, the WHO’s representative in China, said in an interview.“It has not been tried before as a public health measure.“We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.”The illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in central China’s Hubei province.The vast majority of mainland China’s more than 570 cases have been in the city.Other cases have been reported in the US, Japan, South Korea and Thailand.Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong reported their first cases on Thursday.Most illnesses outside China involve people who were from Wuhan or had recently travelled there.Seventeen people have died, all of them in and around Wuhan. The oldest was 89, the youngest 48.Images from Wuhan showed long queues and empty shelves at supermarkets, as residents stocked up for what could be weeks of isolation.Lunar New YearLocal authorities in Wuhan demanded all residents wear masks in public places and urged government staff to wear them at work and shopkeepers to post signs for their visitors, Xinhua news agency reported.Xinhua quoted the city’s anti-virus task force as saying the measures were taken in an attempt to “effectively cut off the virus spread, resolutely curb the outbreak and guarantee the people’s health and safety”.The sharp rise in illnesses comes as millions of Chinese travel for the Lunar New Year, one of the world’s largest annual migrations of people.Chinese are expected to take an estimated three billion trips during the 40-day spike in travel.Analysts predicted cases will continue to multiply.The coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the Sars outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or Mers, which developed from camels.Many countries are screening travellers from China for illness, especially those arriving from Wuhan.Ireland’s Department of Health, relying on a previous assessment, described the risk of a case in Europe as low at present.The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised Irish travellers that, while the risk of contracting the disease in China remains low, their travel could be disrupted by increased quarantine and containment measures there.It says the Irish Embassy in China will continue to monitor the situation. – Additional reporting ReutersAssociated Press"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4149448.1579811754!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain s strategy causes confusion ahead of next phase of eu talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson at 10 Downing Street in London, England. Photograph: Peter SummersGetty ImagesJust days ahead of Britain’s exit from the European Union, both sides claim to be well prepared for the forthcoming negotiations about their future relationship. Downing Street says Boris Johnson would happily start the talks the day after Brexit Day, if only the EU didn’t have to wait until February 24th to agree its negotiating mandate.Whitehall sources recall that the EU complained that Theresa May’s government was never clear about what it wanted, adding that Johnson’s approach would present no such problems. Britain wants a Canada-style free trade deal, they say, citing the Conservative manifesto’s promise that the future arrangement should involve no “political alignment”.The EU is unsure, however, what London means when it says it wants no alignment, and some in Brussels wonder if Downing Street itself knows.We will get an idea of the EU’s approach to the negotiations in the days after Brexit Day, when the European Commission publishes its “negotiation directives”. These will be the commission’s proposals for the negotiating mandate that must be approved by the 27 member-state governments.If Downing Street thinks the commission’s proposals represent an outlandish opening bid that will be substantially watered down by the member states, it is likely to be disappointed. Michel Barnier, who is leading the EU’s negotiating team, has been consulting the 27 governments to ensure that the commission’s proposals contain no surprises and the directives he publishes are likely to be close to the final negotiating mandate.Johnson will outline Britain’s approach in a speech in early February, which could also sketch out what he hopes to achieve in a trade deal with the US.Scaling downDespite warnings from Brussels about the tight timetable for the negotiations, both sides agree that it is possible to agree a deal by the end of this year, although the EU insists that such an agreement will have to be very limited. This could involve a dramatic scaling down of ambition a few months into the negotiations, prioritising progress in those areas where a cliff-edge at the end of the Brexit transition period at the end of December would be most damaging.Britain and the EU have a mutual interest in securing a free trade agreement covering goods and a security arrangement that allows them to continue to share information on criminal suspects and to extradite them with ease.The EU believes it is making Britain a generous offer of zero-tariff, zero-quota access for goods to its market of 450 million people. What it demands in return is a commitment from Britain to maintain a “level playing field” on state aid, social and environmental standards and taxation.Speaking in Davos on Thursday, chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid said Britain was leaving the single market and the customs union to gain control of its rules and laws.“We will be a sovereign and independent country, not a rule-taker. But we’ll always protect the interests of British businesses throughout this process and we’ll maintain high standards – not because we are told to, but because we want to,” he said.Voluntary arrangementJavid’s remarks reflect a view in Downing Street that Britain can voluntarily maintain high standards but it cannot agree to anything that would mean automatically adopting new rules set in Brussels. This rules out “dynamic alignment” with EU rules but it does not necessarily exclude a commitment to “non-regression” by maintaining at least the same high standards when the transition period ends in December.In May’s deal, which the EU regards as the starting point for negotiations, Britain agreed to dynamic alignment on state aid rules but only to non-regression on social and environmental standards. On taxation, Britain agreed to remain aligned with a number of directives.In reality, Britain spends much less on state aid than other big European countries, so a major expansion in its support for businesses would probably be possible even if it agreed to non-regression with the EU. EU member states watched with alarm Johnson’s swift intervention to rescue the airline Flybe and they will want any free trade agreement to include a cast-iron commitment on limiting state aid.Despite Johnson’s wish to de-dramatise the negotiations, they will inevitably hit turbulence, particularly on issues such as fish, which raise passions in a number of countries, including Britain. Any deal which is agreed within the few months available this year is certain to be a narrow one with major costs to Britain’s economy and to some member states. But neither side has yet adopted a position that makes a deal by December impossible.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The public address system announced another flight delay or cancellation every other minute.I had heard rumours that the city was shortly to be locked down entirely and on a Whatsapp group for British expats, one panicked member had told me his flight out the next day had been cancelled. “The rumours are true, they’re locking us down!” he said. I was hit by a wave of relief as I finally sank into my seat on my plane to Shanghai. My face was sore and sweaty from the clammy face mask I\u0027d been wearing all day, but I’d made it out in time - just.When I had arrived a couple of days earlier Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, was eerily deserted. A few residents with basic face masks were casually finishing up their Spring Festival shopping as the country wound down for the Lunar New Year holiday this weekend. There had been dozens of confirmed cases by that point and a handful of deaths linked to the coronavirus.A token string of police tape flapped in the wind at the shuttered market where the virus was first discovered on December 31. A camouflage containment tent and a pile of used face masks on the floor beyond the barricade was the only hint that I was at ground zero of an international epidemic.According to residents the market sold live wolf pups, porcupines and other exotic animals. Fresh game killed \u0027warm\u0027 in front of shoppers has been partly blamed for creating prime breeding grounds for diseases like the coronavirus.Coronavirus everything you need to know puffA mile away I stumbled across another similar market, stacked high with colorful fruit and veg, and fat cuts of raw meat swinging on hooks in the stiff  breeze. “It’s quiet today because a lot of people have left for Chinese New Year,” Rong Bao, a 27-year-old stall holder told me. “The virus is serious but it’s under control.”At the airport the flight cancellations were stacking up and the rumours were mounting that a lockdown was imminent. But as I dashed for my plane I still breezed through security with no additional screening.Staff members disinfecting at the Yingtan North Railway Station in NanchangHours after I got out authorities ordered a total and unprecedented shutdown of Wuhan and two surrounding cities. All trains were cancelled, flights were grounded and roads were blocked in and out.As I sat on the Shanghai metro after arriving home, tussles were breaking out over the last bag of rice or the final bottle of milk in Wuhan’s supermarkets. The streets were once again abandoned.The wholesale market where the virus was discoveredBy mid-morning on Thursday, trucks were slowly roaming the streets spraying disinfectant into every crevice while lines of soldiers stood stoic, masked and silent outside the entrances of all major transport hubs with a looped recording on loud speakers warning residents to stay away.A rare silence blanketed my metro carriage as I looked up to see a sea of face masks and furrowed brows glued to phones. The death toll was climbing and new cases appearing around the country - and as far away as the US. Wuhan may have been quarantined but the deadly disease has not stopped at the city limits.HS2 over-budget because Government \u0026#39underestimated\u0026#39 the scale of project, damning new report claimsBritain\u0026#39s small birds have been boosted by warmer winter, says RSPB ahead of annual surveyAirport-style body scanners to be rolled out to prisons after trials cut drug useInsys founder John Kapoor sentenced to five and a half years in prison for opioid bribesHarry Dunn: US Secretary of State rejects extradition request for woman charged with the teenager\u0026#39s deathFourteen people in Britain tested for coronavirus, as Health Secretary says UK is prepared for virusNicola Sturgeon\u0026#39s civil servants continuing to draw up independence \u0026#39White Paper Two\u0026#39 despite referendum refusalPlanting trees cannot offset burning wood, warn experts after government advisers recommend it as renewable fuelComment: China has quarantined 20 million to contain the coronavirus – but it could be too lateOxford University professor given security guards for lectures after threats from transgender activistsCrime figures: Theft \u0026#39decriminalised\u0026#39 as police fail to pursue all prosecutionsComment: Distracted by indyref2 and in denial about crumbling public services - all is not well with Sturgeon\u0026#39s government Comment: The Davos crowd could learn a thing or two from Boris\u0026#39s new liberal Conservatism  John Bercow faces investigation over bullying allegations after House of Lords agrees to change rulesSchool leaders accuse ministers of \u0026#39eroding\u0026#39 their confidence after two major data issuesNato\u0026#39s purchase of five drones is \u0026#39first concrete sign\u0026#39 of moving away from USIsrael accuses the BBC of \u0026#39belittling the Holocaust\u0026#39 on eve of major Auschwitz ceremonySussex becomes first council to ban fishing along coast to cut greenhouse emissions following Attenborough-backed campaignSaudi star escapes jail time in London following accusations of animal crueltyDonald Trump told his actions \u0026#39shame\u0026#39 even Nixon in Day 3 of impeachment trialTrump invites Netanyahu to Washington for Israeli-Palestinian peace plan talks We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"israel accuses bbc belittling holocaust eve major auschwitz","story":"The BBC has been accused by Israel of “belittling the Holocaust” on the eve of a major ceremony to remember the liberation of Auschwitz.Jewish leaders suggested a report on the News at Ten had fuelled antisemitism by appearing to link Israel’s treatment of Palestinians to the Nazi murders of six million people.A former BBC chairman demanded that the corporation’s director general make clear whether he supported the “gratuitous and insensitive” broadcast, while the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism issued a formal complaint.The row came as Prince Charles joined world leaders in Jerusalem to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Auschwitz-Birkenau’s liberation by the Soviets in January 1945.Prince Charles met with Israel President Reuven Rivlin, left, and Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis at his official residence in JerusalemShown on Wednesday evening, the segment was narrated by the BBC’s international correspondent Orla Guerin, who has previously faced accusations of anti-Israel bias.After interviewing a tearful Holocaust survivor whose entire family was murdered in death camps, Ms Guerin ended her report by showing images of young Israeli soldiers entering Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem. In a voiceover she said: “The State of Israel is now a regional power. For decades it has occupied Palestinian territories. “But some here will always see their nation through the prism of persecution and survival.”BBC correspondent Orla Guerin faced accusations of anti-Israel bias while reporting from the Middle East Her report sparked an immediate backlash from Jewish groups who said it fell within the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism adopted by the British government, which includes drawing comparisons between Israeli policy and the Nazis.Ms Guerin’s sign off was also condemned by the Israeli government. “The remarks made by BBC News reporter Orla Guerin at the end of her report about an event dedicated to commemorating the Holocaust and fighting antisemitism, do exactly the opposite,” said Lior Haiat, spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.“They belittle the Holocaust by aggressively pushing an irrelevant issue. Shameful and disgusting.”A BBC spokesman last night defended the report, adding the corporation would not wish any comparison to be drawn between the Holocaust and Israel’s policy toward Palestine.But the Board of Deputies, which represents British Jewish community, demanded an apology for the “crass and offensive” remarks.Meanwhile former BBC chairman Lord Grade called on Lord Hall of Birkenhead, the corporation’s director general, to announce whether he supported or disavowed Ms Guerin’s remarks.“It was an extremely gratuitous and insensitive piece of commentary,” Lord Grade told the .“In the circumstances I believe that the director general - as the editor-in-chief - should say publicly whether he supports what was said.”Ms Guerin, 53, has won multiple awards since joining the BBC in 1995, but has previously faced accusations of pro-Palestinian leanings.While she was working as the BBC’s Jerusalem correspondent in 2004, the Israeli government accused her of displaying a total identification with the goals and methods of the Palestinian terror groups and a deep-seated bias against Israel over a report on a 16-year-old would-be suicide bomber. The complaint was later said to have been discussed by then-director general Mark Thompson with the late Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon.In 2015 Ms Guerin faced further accusations of “directly misleading” viewers by failing to acknowledge the involvement of militant Palestinian groups in a spate of stabbings. On both occasions the BBC defended her coverage.The BBC appointed Malcolm Balen, a former editor of the Nine O\u0027Clock News, to produce an internal report in 2004 examining whether the corporation was biased in its coverage of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. It then spent £200,000 on a successful eight-year battle to suppress the report’s findings.A spokesman for the BBC said: “The brief reference in our Holocaust report to Israel’s position did not imply any comparison between the two and nor would we want one to be drawn from our coverage.”Ms Guerin declined to comment.HS2 over-budget because Government \u0026#39underestimated\u0026#39 the scale of project, damning new report claimsBritain\u0026#39s small birds have been boosted by warmer winter, says RSPB ahead of annual surveyAirport-style body scanners to be rolled out to prisons after trials cut drug useInsys founder John Kapoor sentenced to five and a half years in prison for opioid bribesHarry Dunn: US Secretary of State rejects extradition request for woman charged with the teenager\u0026#39s deathFourteen people in Britain tested for coronavirus, as Health Secretary says UK is prepared for virusNicola Sturgeon\u0026#39s civil servants continuing to draw up independence \u0026#39White Paper Two\u0026#39 despite referendum refusalPlanting trees cannot offset burning wood, warn experts after government advisers recommend it as renewable fuelComment: China has quarantined 20 million to contain the coronavirus – but it could be too lateOxford University professor given security guards for lectures after threats from transgender activistsCrime figures: Theft \u0026#39decriminalised\u0026#39 as police fail to pursue all prosecutionsComment: Distracted by indyref2 and in denial about crumbling public services - all is not well with Sturgeon\u0026#39s government Comment: The Davos crowd could learn a thing or two from Boris\u0026#39s new liberal Conservatism  John Bercow faces investigation over bullying allegations after House of Lords agrees to change rulesSchool leaders accuse ministers of \u0026#39eroding\u0026#39 their confidence after two major data issuesNato\u0026#39s purchase of five drones is \u0026#39first concrete sign\u0026#39 of moving away from USSussex becomes first council to ban fishing along coast to cut greenhouse emissions following Attenborough-backed campaignSaudi star escapes jail time in London following accusations of animal crueltyDonald Trump told his actions \u0026#39shame\u0026#39 even Nixon in Day 3 of impeachment trialTrump invites Netanyahu to Washington for Israeli-Palestinian peace plan talks We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/15/16/love-island-sr6-ep1-23.jpg","title":"love island fast fashion 20 pledges environment","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.I’ve decided to give up fast fashion for 2020.

Coffee bean salesman Conor comes from Brighton but has been living in Australia for the past four years. He\u0027s had two big relationships, one good, one bad. His celebrity crush is Maya Jama.Police officer Mike thinks his charming nature will attract attention in the villa. His mum is hoping he\u0027ll meet someone and move out of her house. Celebrity crush? Beyonce and Rihanna. Callum is a scaffolder from Manchester who claims to have builders\u0027 banter – whatever that is. He\u0027s a cheeky chap but down-to-earth as well. His celebrity crush is Megan Fox.Sports science graduate and builder Nas claims to be different to the guys who have been on the show before. He describes himself as funny, caring and considerate – a well-rounded person. His celebrity crush is Aladdin star Naomi Scott.Ollie is an estate owner and heir to the Lanhydrock estate in Cornwall. He claims to be an alpha male but expects to be the butt of all jokes. He\u0027s a self-confessed attention-seeker who wears his emotions on his sleeve. His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it is only a hint, since scientists are not able to produce anything like speech.It relied on a host of technology, including precise CT scans that gave a picture of the vocal tract that could then be printed out and used to synthesise a voice.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSuch a breakthrough is impossible for most remains, because it relies on perfect preservation of the bodies\u0027 soft tissues, and in most cases only the skeleton is left over. But the mummified body of the ancient Egyptian priest\u0026nbspNesyamun\u0026nbspwas so well preserved that researchers could build a precise recreation of the unique vocal sounds.The scientists behind the research noted that Nesyamun\u0027s voice would have been integral to his life: living during the unstable\u0026nbspreign of pharaoh Ramses XI, around 1100 BC, he worked as a scribe and a priest who would have used his voice to speak and sing during rituals.Created with Sketch.Mummified animals discovered in Egyptian necropolis Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mummified cats on display after their discovery at the Saqqara necropolisA mummified lion wrapped in linenA crocodile mummy on displayA casket containing the mummy of a catSome of the 75 wooden and bronze statues of cats discovered at the Saqqara necropolisThe head of a cat statueVisitors examine the display of mummified felinesA large statue of a scarabA mummified cat wrapped in linenMummified cats on display after their discovery at the Saqqara necropolisA mummified lion wrapped in linenA crocodile mummy on displayA casket containing the mummy of a catSome of the 75 wooden and bronze statues of cats discovered at the Saqqara necropolisThe head of a cat statueVisitors examine the display of mummified felinesA large statue of a scarabA mummified cat wrapped in linenThe researchers could only produce a single sound: a vowel that they describe as being between the English words bed and bad. But it offers a hint of what the rest of his voice might sound like.In Ancient Egypt, the afterlife came with a guidebookIt might also lead to future breakthroughs that will allow the public the chance to hear what ancient iniduals might really have sounded like.Scientists questioned whether making\u0026nbspNesyamun speak again was ethically responsible, especially given mummies are treated not as objects but as the remains of once-living people.But they decided it would be good to do so in part because his coffin includes inscriptions that make reference to the ancient Egyptian view that to speak the name of the dead is to make them live again and that he communicated a wish to be able move and speak in the afterlife as he did when he was alive.The team concluded that the potential benefts outweighed the concerns, particularly because Nesyamun’s own words express his desire to ‘speak again’ and that the scientifc techniques used were non-destructive, they write in the paper published in Scientific Reports.Given Nesyamun’s stated desire to have his voice heard in the afterlife in order to live forever, the fulflment of his beliefs through the synthesis of his vocal function allows us to make direct contact with ancient Egypt by listening to a sound from a vocal tract that has not been heard for over 3000 years, preserved through mummification and now restored through this new technique, they conclude.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After the initial 18-month period comes to an end – which for many people will be next month – those who have not brought down their balances could be put on to a payment plan or face more severe options.Akansha Nath, credit expert at Credit Karma, which commissioned the survey, said: “It’s daunting to think that we might be well into April before we’re consistently back in the black, but rather than using ‘quick fixes’ to free up some extra cash, there are lots of simple ways to get back in control of our finances, from creating a new budget to reviewing all outgoings or transferring debts to a 0 per cent balance transfer card.”Borrowers seeking a zero per cent credit card now have less choice available to them as banks have withdrawn some cards from the market and reduced the interest-free periods.This month, Bank of England research showed that the length of balance transfer deals reduced markedly and the availability of unsecured debt decreased towards the end of 2019 as lenders became more nervous about the UK economy.Financial website Moneyfacts says the number of cards that allow balance transfers has dropped by more than a third in the past three years to reach a record low.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

The share of companies warning in 2019 hit 17.8 per cent, just surpassing 2008’s figure at the peak of the financial crisis. A third of FTSE-listed retailers issued warnings in 2019.The figures came as the retail industry said shops shed 57,000 jobs in 2019 as employment in the once-vibrant high street and shopping centre contracted for the fourth successive year.The British Retail Consortium said the total number of retail employees fell by 1.8 per cent in the final three months of 2019 compared with a year earlier. Full time employment fell by 3.0 per cent and part-time by 1.2 per cent.This was the 16th consecutive quarterly fall, which the BRC said was “proof” that the transformation of the retail industry was ongoing.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive said it was essential the government used its review of the business rates system for a reform of a tax that fall disproportionately heavily on retailers.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After the initial 18-month period comes to an end – which for many people will be next month – those who have not brought down their balances could be put on to a payment plan or face more severe options.Akansha Nath, credit expert at Credit Karma, which commissioned the survey, said: “It’s daunting to think that we might be well into April before we’re consistently back in the black, but rather than using ‘quick fixes’ to free up some extra cash, there are lots of simple ways to get back in control of our finances, from creating a new budget to reviewing all outgoings or transferring debts to a 0 per cent balance transfer card.”Borrowers seeking a zero per cent credit card now have less choice available to them as banks have withdrawn some cards from the market and reduced the interest-free periods.This month, Bank of England research showed that the length of balance transfer deals reduced markedly and the availability of unsecured debt decreased towards the end of 2019 as lenders became more nervous about the UK economy.Financial website Moneyfacts says the number of cards that allow balance transfers has dropped by more than a third in the past three years to reach a record low.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They mean that our planet is ablaze with elusive particles that stream up to its surface – but are entirely invisible to our eyes.Astronomers solve mystery of element that helped create life on EarthThe Borexino detector located at the underground\u0026nbspLaboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy aims to see that invisible flow of particles. Scientists have been watching for neutrinos since 2007, and have been collecting informaiton over that time.By last year, the researchers had spotted the new stream of ghost particles as well as making their measurements more certain.Geoneutrinos are the only direct traces of the radioactive decays that occur inside the Earth, and which produce an as yet unknown portion of the energy driving all the dynamics of our planet, said\u0026nbspLivia Ludhova, one of the two current scientific coordinators of Borexino, in a statement.The new discoveries could help shed light on those mysterious processes, which help create the unexplained heat that comes from the centre of the Earth. The world beneath our feet gives rise to a host of strange phenomena – such as the Earth\u0027s spectacular volcanos and magnetic field – which are not like any other seen in the solar system.The new data helps refine scientists\u0027 understanding of how those processes happen. It shows that it is very likely that radioactive processes inside the Earth are generating more than half of its heat, with the rest coming from the original formation of the planet, meaning that those radioactive processes are responsible for those volcanos and earthquakes that change life on the surface.Scientists hope they can learn yet more about those mysterious processes, by measuring the ghost particles with more precision. In China, an experiment called Juno is currently being built that will be 70 times bigger than Borexino and could give vastly more insight.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I thought why not make a sport of it, and murder over beats? So before you jump the gun, please allow me to explain,” he wrote.Created with Sketch.

Like all\u0026nbspCondé\u0026nbspNast brands, the website is based out of One World Trade Center, which was built after the original site was destroyed in the 911 attacks.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNBC reporter Ben Kesslen highlighted that fact in reaction to Halsey’s tweet, writing:\u0026nbsp”Losing my mind thinking about the person on Halsey’s team who had to tell her she just called for the collapse of One World Trade.”Halsey eventually deleted the tweet and explained she had chosen to remove it after becoming aware of the situation.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The 50 best albums of 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate.

On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion.

She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past.

Instead, the European Commission could decide to force them to with new regulation, MEPs suggested.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The voluntary agreements between different industry players have not yielded the desired results.Apple set to release cheaper and smaller iPhone, report saysBut Apple rejected that characterisation, suggesting that phone manufacturers had actually unified around two different ports. All iPhones have used its Lightning cable for nearly a decade, and most new Android phones use USB-C, it pointed out, claiming that this approach does work.Apple is unlikely to license its proprietary Lightning port to other phone manufacturers, meaning that any new EU rule would almost certainly mean the company would be forced to switch to a new port. That would mean Apple customers throwing away their wires and other accessories, the company claimed, which would have a direct negative impact by disrupting the hundreds of millions of active devices and accessories used by our European customers and even more Apple customers worldwide, creating an unprecedented volume of electronic waste and greatly inconveniencing users.Instead, Apple suggested that regulators should\u0026nbspfocus on the other end of the wire, where the charging cable plugs into the power. Unifying those ports would allow users to plug their charging cables into similar ports\u0026nbsp– in hotel rooms or\u0026nbspcafés, for instance – no matter what plug was on their phone.We do not believe there is a case for regulation given the industry is already moving to the use of\u0026nbspUSB\u0026nbspType-C through a connector or cable assembly, Apple said in its statement. This includes Apple’s\u0026nbspUSB-C\u0026nbsppower adapter which is compatible with all iPhone and\u0026nbspiPad\u0026nbspdevices. This approach is more affordable and convenient for consumers, enables charging for a wide range of portable electronic products, encourages people to re-use their charger and allows for innovation.The Lightning port was introduced in 2012, with the iPhone 5, as a replacement for Apple\u0027s old 30-pin connector. Since then it has been used on almost every one of Apple\u0027s portable devices, though the recent iPad Pro uses the industry standard USB-C port.Apple gave no firm indication that it would stick with the existing Lightning port in its iPhones. It has been rumoured that the company is moving towards getting rid of the charging port entirely, and recent handsets have included wireless charging that does away with the need for a wire.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No-one says that Boris Johnson sneers at people.“Somebody like me who comes from a council estate and from a single parent background, I don’t sneer at people, I listen to them.”Ms Thornberry said she had been “laughing at Dawn saying the most extraordinary things”, adding: “I have never sneered and it’s not right to say so, and I do not accept that.”Challenged over her decision to send her son to a partially selective comprehensive school 14 miles away from their north London home, Ms Thornberry replied: “As a politician, what I want to do is make sure we have good schools up and down the country.“But as a mother, I will never apologise for doing the best for my kids. Any mother watching this will agree with me.“As the victim of selective education who failed her 11-plus and went to a secondary modern, I feel very strongly about this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

The petition, addressed to Mr Trudeau, reads: “Canadians wish the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, all the best as they seek financial independence. That goal is important because Canadian taxpayers shouldn’t have to cover the couple’s bills.”The Canadian island rallying to protect Meghan and Harry’s privacyAaron Wudrick, federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, a campaign group “dedicated to lower taxes, less waste and accountable government” told The Independent there was no personal animosity aimed at the royal couple, who are living in the town of North Saanich, 20 miles north of Victoria, the largest town on Vancouver Island.“In the last two weeks I received lots of phone calls from people saying the couple were welcome here, but that they did not want to pay for them,” said Mr Wudrick.\u0026nbsp“I think in recent weeks, that feeling has become more clear. Canada is a welcoming country, but some people excited they are here are viewing them as wealthy celebrities, rather than official members of the royal family where there is a protocol.”Meghan Markle’s father accuses daughter of quitting royal family for moneyHe added: “They are coming here because they want to leave the royal family, but part of that is paying their own bills.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailEarlier month, the Globe and Mail quoted security experts who suggested the annual cost of protecting Harry, Meghan and their eight-month-old son Archie, could reach C$10m (£5.8m).The point made in Mr Wudrich’s petition, first reported by the New York Post, was echoed by many residents in the part of Vancouver Island where the royal couple are living. While having offered them a warm welcome, and even helping them avoid media scrutiny, there is a view Canadians should not pay.“I think the point is, they are either private citizens or members of the royal family,” said Bruce Welsh, 70, a former musician and radio show host in Sidney. “If they are private citizens, they should not need security guards. Either way, Canada should not be paying.”Royal family: Is Prince Harry still in the line of succession?Canadian shopkeeper who served Prince Harry glad he returned ‘home’Oprah defends Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s royal exit Meghan Markle’s father admits he lied to Prince Harry about photosMena Brash, a retired political scientist who was having coffee in the Georgia Cafe on Thursday morning, said Mr Trudeau would be required to study what laws existed.\u0026nbsp“If there’s an agreement in place, we will have to pay it. A petition will not make any difference,” she said.Michael Phillips, 73, who moved to Canada from Britain three decades ago, described himself as an arch anti-royalist. He said he thought the media should leave the couple in peace, but said Canadians should not bear the cost of that privacy.“Canadians should not pay a single cent,” he said. ‘The royal family should be disbanded and they should all be allowed to live their own lives.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University. She had flitted easily between both sides, up until recently, when she moved to Shanghai. “I think the situation in Hong Kong is quite sensitive now, which is easy for people to have conflicts due to different political stands,” she says. “That’s why I’ve decided to leave Hong Kong to work and get away from the intense environment.”Even though the protests in Hong Kong show no sign of abating, Ke remains optimistic unity will overcome ision. She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The eventual wording\u0026nbspof the amendments also brought surprises. In particular, they offered no obvious constitutional short circuit\u0026nbspfor Mr Putin to exercise\u0026nbspformal power outside the presidency. Far from weakening the powers of a successor in favour of parliament or some new body, the changes actually strengthen the role. Any future president will be able to fire constitutional judges, and will also get an extra veto to block parliamentary votes.\u0026nbspSo what exactly are Mr Putin’s intentions? And if we assume that he is leaving the presidency, where does he want to end up?\u0026nbspThe honest answer is nobody knows. The Russian president has kept his cards close to his chest, and is unlikely to reveal them for some time.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFor the time being, his most likely post-2024 destination seems to be\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsprole\u0026nbspas head of a beefed-up State Council, a federal body comprised of regional governors\u0026nbspwhich up to now wielded only limited power. At his state of the nation address, Mr Putin suggested strengthening the council further. Many experts surmised that meant it could grow into a\u0026nbspcommittee\u0026nbsplike\u0026nbspthe Soviet Politburo, with a broad purview covering most policy areas.\u0026nbspRussia looks to prospect of future without Vladimir PutinThe constitutional amendment passed on Thursday fell roughly in line with such expectations. The State Council’s role was determined as follows: “Ensuring proper functioning and interaction between state bodies, and determining the main directions of domestic, foreign and socio-economic policy.” The exact scope of its powers will become clear in a separate law yet to be published.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Putin\u0026nbsphas also appeared to rule out the very\u0026nbspidea of him carving out a supervisory role above any successor.\u0026nbspSpeaking on Wednesday, Mr Putin said he did not intend to stay on and “mentor” in the way Sinagapore’s long-time leader Lee Kuan Yew did in the 1990s.\u0026nbsp“In different countries there are different situations, different histories, different cultures,” he said. “In Russia, if you put an institution above the president, it would mean dual power – a fatal situation for a country like ours.”\u0026nbspAll of which brings us to a more logical inference of Mr Putin’s constitutional rewrite: that he may, in fact, be paving the way for a genuine successor in 2024.\u0026nbspViewed from this perspective, the complicated constitutional\u0026nbsptrickery\u0026nbspmakes much more sense. The changes look to be geared less towards ensuring the continuation of Mr Putin as they are of guaranteeing the survival of Putinism and its\u0026nbspideologies.\u0026nbsp“The changes do not limit presidential prerogative in any real way and do not offer an obvious way for Putin to stay on,” says Tatyana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Centre. “What they do is strengthen the authority of the centre, as well as creating a transitory period in which Putin can observe a chosen successor from afar.”Wherever he ends up in 2024, Mr Putin will retain hold of three important levers of informal power, the expert says. He will remain the most popular politician in the land. He will be able to exercise power via United Russia, the ruling party he set up (and is likely to head). And he can act via the hundreds of people he appointed to high office.In today’s\u0026nbspRussia, such levers\u0026nbspcount\u0026nbspfor an awful lot.\u0026nbsp“It\u0026nbspshould be enough for him to remove a successor and try another one if he thinks it is necessary,” Ms Stanovaya says.\u0026nbspSocial media has been awash with possible theories as to why the president is acting in such a rush. Is he ill? Is he spooked by falling popularity? Is he acting on the advice of a psychic who advised him it was now or never? Or, more bizarrely: is there a lady, a Meghan Markle type, dragging him from the limelight?\u0026nbspHow 20 years of Putin has shaped Russia and the worldPolitical analyst Konstantin Kalachyov suggests\u0026nbspMr Putin’s haste is most likely provoked by a “combination” of factors.\u0026nbsp“We obviously cannot discount the idea that Mr Putin has a diagnosis of some kind, one that may not have a clear expiry date,” the analyst says. “At the same time, he’s already made it clear that he does not want to go down in history as a bumbling old Brezhnev-type figure. He understands it’s better to arrange these things while there is time and opportunity to do so.”\u0026nbspThe Russian president seems to be using the moment to ensure that a successor doesn’t change course.\u0026nbsp“All the amendments are about extending the life of Putinism. The central idea of national independence. The exclusion of external influence. The continuation of statism and a\u0026nbspconservative ideology,” Kalachyov says. \u0026nbsp“The one thing Putin doesn’t want is a repeat of what he did to Yeltsin – which was to rip up an entire legacy.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

On the contrary, it is an abdication that has sadly plunged him into turmoil.He is a man pulled in opposite directions, torn between patriotic duty and his deep love for his we, between his loyalty to the monarchy and his desire for a new, less constrained role.That explains why, throughout the recent crisis that he and Meghan inflicted on the House of Windsor, his stance has been so confused and contradictory.He speaks of his devotion to Britain but seeks a fresh start in Canada.He expresses his desire to serve but gives up the commitments that go with his position.He trumpets his yearning for privacy, yet he and his we appear keen to set themselves up as a millionaire celebrity couple - hardly the way to avoid attention.He continually wails about media intrusion, yet he resigns as Captain-General of the Royal Marines so he can spend more time on his social media accounts.He and the Duchess endlessly talk about their need for emotional support, yet they have shown little concern for the needs of their own families.Those inconsistencies were graphically exposed in the speech he made on Sunday night at a charity dinner in London to try and justy his recent conduct.His address was given in the immediate aftermath of the deal reached at Sandringham, where he and Meghan agreed to the loss of public funding and the use of their titles infor their independence.It was clear that the saga had exacted a heavy toll on him. In a voice often cracking with emotion, he told his audience that they would “hear the truth from me”.But what they actually heard was a catalogue of embittered anguish.As often, he moaned about the press, which he painted as a sinister, powerful force which needs to be curtailed.Unfortunately, despite all his professed love of Britain, Harry appears to have no understanding that a free, open media is essential to our democracy.He has proved unable to handle any criticism at all – even when it is justied, as in the hypocrisy of his green campaigning while indulging in the use of private jets.It is ashe thinks the media should be filled with fawning sycophants who never scrutinise but just lavish him with praise.That is the kind of regime that belongs to a totalitarian dictatorship, not traditionally liberal Britain.Much of Harry’s hostility to journalists stems from their relationship with his mother. But, however understandable, this is another myth.Princess Diana was not naïve when it came to the press. She was a shrewd, sometimes ruthless operator, who was quite willing to exploit the newspapers when it suited her.With some indignation, he complained that the Sandringham deal was not what he wanted. But it was foolish of him to believe that he and Meghan could have semi-detached Royal status, enjoying its privileges without its obligations.The Queen could never have tolerated that, especially because any commercial deals reached by the Sussexes could have badly compromised her family, just as their cherished fashionable causes could have undermined the Crown.Royalty cannot be a vehicle for self-enrichment or political posturing.The Duke’s inner agony was at its most obvious when he spoke of his regrets for the le he is leaving.Having revealed that he and Meghan were excited to “fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride”, he referred to his “great sadness” at the step they have taken.Yet he claimed that they had “really no other option”. It was another moment of self-deceit, for there were certainly other courses open to them.They could have either stuck to their Royal positions without creating such a psycho drama about themselves, or,they really wanted freedom without scrutiny, they could have retired to live quietly as ordinary citizens, as some other members of the Royal family have done in the past.But such modesty would not have fulfilled their ambitions to be globe-trotting celebrities.It is this craving for fame that highlights the emptiness of Harry’s language about his devotion to service. “I will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his le to supporting the causes, charities and military communities so important to me,” he declared at the charity dinner.Yet this is the same man who was revealed to have touted his we’s voiceover skills to Disney bosses at the London premiere of the Lion King last summer.In the eyes of their critics, the real dedication that Harry and Meghan will probably soon show is to TV deals, book advances, and brand partnerships.In a further attempt to justy their actions, Harry implied that they had been suffering for a long time through the crushing restrictions of Royal le.The final move had been made, he explained, “after so many months of talks and so many years of challenges.”He and Meghan have only been married for  months. A true model of stoical determination, the Queen has been on the throne for almost  years without any public complaint.That just illustrates Harry’s lack of perspective. Insulated by privilege, he has little understanding of the lives of ordinary British citizens, many of whom have endured far greater struggles than anything he has ever experienced.After the Queen had been so publicly generous about him and Meghan in her statement from Sandringham at the weekend, saying that “they will always be much loved members of my family,” it was bad manners of Harry to complain about the deal he had just accepted.He should have responded to his grandmother’s generosity in the same spirit.But what’s done is done. Our monarchy has survived its latest crisis. The moment for recriminations has passed now that a new chapter is about to begin.As he settles in Canada, Prince Harry is bound to miss aspects of his old le in Britain, which even now he describes as “my home and the place I love.And the British public will miss him. At his best, he brought a lovable humour, spontaneity and lack of convention to the Royal Family.We can only hope that now, after taking this drastic decision, he finds the peace that he and Meghan crave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which makes Hall’s defence of the licence fee even more ridiculous.In an era of multiple-choice subscription TV it is absurd for one broadcaster to be funded by a tax enforceable by criminal penalty.It is even more laughable to claim it “ensures independence­ . . . obliges us to serve everyone and reflect every part of the UK”.Hall’s BBC spent his entire tenure turning a deaf ear to half the UK. Hence its shock at last month’s Tory triumph.Hall’s decision to rob over-s of the free licences he agreed to in  was equally outrageous.The idea that the £million cost will harm vital BBC services, when so much of its content amounts to needless competition with commercial rivals, is fatally flawed.His successor must run a smaller Beeb, more in touch with the public, less in the grip of suffocating “wokeness”, focused not on gratuitous expansion but the high-quality shows it does best.This new chief should accept that non-payment of the licence must be decriminalised and the levy finally replaced with a voluntary subscription.Only then will the BBC join the st Century.THE problem with Harry saying he and Meghan had no option but to move abroad to avoid our “powerful media” is that not a word of it is true.It is sheer paranoia to say the Press has done anything but legitimately scrutinise a publicly-funded couple.And the reality is they do not want to avoid media. They want to avoid criticism.Indeed they crave media attentionit meekly writes their PR puff pieces. Corbyn’s Labour is the same.As for having no choice, what drivel.They could have grown up, developed a thicker skin and done their royal duty as they first promised.To pretend that dark forces made them seek a vast fortune as A-list celebs in the LA sunshine is self-serving cobblers.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You have to be creative and aggressive and think two steps ahead of the celebrity.”And therein lies the rub. Largely stripped of his royal status, Harry is now a common-or-garden celebrity who has to take his chances with the rest of them in the jungle of hustling for work amid bustling premiere crowds.Then there’s news website TMZ and its myriad wannabe imitations. They’ll be dogging his every move with a video camera, hoping to catch a magical clickbait moment.Its website — together with a frenzied voiceover — is already jokingthat Meghan might sign up for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.As a former actress on cable show Suits,Meghan was of little interest to the Hollywood glitterati and the parasites that feed off them.But now  She’s gold-dust — particularly as her inner circle includes A-listers such as the Clooneys, Serena Williams, Oprah and the Obamas. And therein lies yet another rub. If you attend premieres of movies you’re not in, holiday on rich people’s jets and yachts and hang out at members-only clubs where the hoi polloi are only allowed in to clean up after you . . . then you are wilfully choosing a “celebrity le” and, with that, comes media attention, particularly from the Wild West of online.They need you for clickbait, and you need them to maintain the “popularity” upon which you trade and, without which, you are nothing .Unless, of course, you have a God- given talent like Meryl Streep, Judi Dench, Gary Oldman, Benedict Cumberbatch etc, etc — all of whom put on a suit frock when they have a film to promote but otherwise live a perfectly normal, unremarkable and, therefore, largely “peaceful le” unbothered by the media.Or a member of the British Royal Family who can retreat to one of their many estates for a spot of fishing and contemplation.So . . . “a more peaceful le” outside the protective environs of the monarchy  Dream on.But then, deep down, one suspects that Harry and Meghan both know that and are simply using it as a smokescreen for the real story.His we was homesick, found royal duties restrictive and dull and wanted toto her old le with royal knobs on.And because Harry loves her: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”Good luck to them. Genuinely. But let’s not pretend they had no other option because of something this country did or didn’t do.HARRY and Meghan might be forced to ditch their proposed Sussex Royal brandThe Queen sees it as cashing in on their former royal status.As they’ve already registered it for everything from magazines to mugs, dropping it altogether could prove expensive.So perhaps a little tweak — to  Sussex Royle — might be an easy and appropriate compromise As the incomparable Jim Royle, aka Ricky Tomlinson, might say: “Have their cake and eat it  . . My a***.”SHORTLY after actor Laurence Fox’s sterling, anti-PC performance on Question Time last week, he was predictably hosed down on Twitter by the usual virtue-signalling suspects.Including this from singer Lily Allen.“Sick to death of luvvies like aLawrence Fox going on TV and forcing their opinions on everybody , when he’ll never have to deal with what normal people have to deal with in his gated community.“Stick to acting mate.

That narrative doesnt include the creativity, vibrancy, and cultural impact I experienced.Alig spent  years in prison for killing Melendez, a drug dealer, and dismembering his body before tossing his mutilated corpse in Manhattans Hudson River.When asked why he committed the murder, the nightle legend said he didnt know and that the killing was not done on purpose.No, there is no reason, Alig told Rolling Stone in .Not only is there no reason, theres no justication.

It follows a nationwide Wetherspoon policy, which inidual managers can choose to enforce.The poster read: As part of our licensing it is our responsibility to ensure that we are protecting children from harm.Therefore adults in charge of children will be allowed to have one alcoholic drink and a further alcoholic drink with a sit-down meal.It went on to add after the limit had been reached staff would have the legal right to refuse service of alcohol to customers.The boozer said the policy had not been followed rigorously in the past, but it would be taking the ban seriously this year.Being drunk while in charge of a child under the age of seven in a public place is illegal according to the  licensing act and drinkers can face a fine or even a month in prison in more severe cases.The poster has sparked debate on social media.Customer Jonjo OConnell said he agreed with the rule in principle although warned it could be open to abuse.He said: Considering the type of parent it is aimed at, a pub is not a creche and I think some parents seem to forget that!Although I anticipate the rule will be circumvented by some just going around the corner to The Goose and staying there or ing later to the Pocock when a dferent sht arrives.A JD Wetherspoon spokesman said: The manager took the decision to put the poster in the pub to emphasise to customers that she would not allow parents to drink while their children were running round uncontrolled in the pub.The notice had a positive effect, with mostly good feedback."},{"url":null,"title":"queen sick cold engagement cancel","story":"Her Majesty cancelled her trip to the meeting in Norfolk at West Newton village hall with just  minutes notice because she was not feeling up to it.The -year-old monarch usually joins the WI ladies for tea and cake, then listens to a speech, which was made this year by BBC newsreader Huw Edwards.But around half-an-hour before her expected arrival at West Newton Village Hall on Thursday, a member of her security team told assembled reporters and photographers that she will not be coming this year.They told waiting media the Queen was not feeling up to it.The Queen has attended the WI groups meetings since  and took over as President from the Queen Mother, who in turn took over from Queen Mary.She was last seen over the weekend, heading to church in Sandringham with her son Prince Andrew.Todays cancellation comes after a tumultuous few weeks for the Royal Family which saw Prince Harry and Meghan Markle quit as royals.Harry sat down with his grandmother to thrash out details of the so-called Megxit - with it decided the couple would pay back the £.m of taxpayer money spent on refurbishing Frogmore Cottage.They will also live in Canada part-time.Announcing the decision, the Queen said the pair,and their eight-month-old son Archie, would always be much loved members of her family.She said: I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent le.I want to thank them for all their dedicated work across this country, the Commonwealth and beyond, and am particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family.It is my whole family’s hope that today’s agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new le.It came after Prince Andrew was forced to step down from public duties last year after his disastrous Newsnight interview in which he failed to show empathy to the victims of his paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein.But he attended church with the Queen at Sandringham as the monarch beamed following the conclusion of discussions over the future of Harry and Meghan.The Duke is said to have been a “tower of strength” behind the scenes in the last two weeks and has been supporting his parents in their hour of need. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He will be sentenced on February .As Mihai was convicted of fraud, Ms Oruwari said: It has reiterated the fact I am vulnerable and more susceptible to crime and being taken advantage of.The Nigeria-born singer was a finalist on BBC talent show All Together Now, where she brought Geri Halliwell to tears.She has toured the world as a solo soprano and performed at the Royal Opera House.Ms Oruwari, who lost her sight as a child, said: To lead a full le I have to trust people.

Which they are on ­commercial rivals like Nick Ferrari on LBC or Julia Hartley-Brewer on TalkRADIO.At least those stations don’t start from a position of: “Brexit is evil and a majority Tory government isn’t much ­better.”No one is proposing for a single second the BBC be axed. But the poll tax that funds it should be.Its websites that write clickbait about TV shows like Love Island — well ­covered by other online outlets — should be stopped too. Not to mention its recent push into the already saturated podcast market.The BBC’s job is not to be a monolith, shutting out commercial organisations and dominating the entertainment and news industries.That’s what makes yesterday’s decision to axe Victoria Derbyshire’s BBC programme ridiculous.Her award-winning morning show is one of the only news programmes on the ­corporation to properly cover the working class.It is unbiased, feisty, fair and will cover entertainment stories or whatever happens to be the splash of The Sun that day, without the snobbery of the rest of BBC News.That sort of non-commercial show is just the type the Beeb should be making. But — of course — under its latest cuts, it is the first to go.The next Director-General must be an outsider who understands the madness of the BBC’s current priorities and is ­prepared to enact real change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And climate change, whether the prince wants to acknowledge it or not, is an innately political issue.Two of the world’s biggest players – the US and China – are nowhere close to where we are on the so-called crisis.It’s up to Boris Johnson to criticise them and for Charles to calm them down with ceremonial State visits.Sure, Charles should be offering his support and sympathy to the people of Australia impacted by bushfires, for example.Perhaps he could even visit the area and talk about the damage.But offering a ten-point solution politicians should enact is insane – especially given he flew to Davos on a £, private jet trip that emitted six tonnes of carbon.If the hypocritical prince is so impetuous that he can’t see the time has come for his role to change, I genuinely fear for the Royal Family.The last thing the country needs is another two-bit political wannabe trying to gain popularity on the back of Greta.What we desperately need is a future king who can bring us together beyond politics and beyond the embarrassing PR mess engulfing his family.CHRIS MARTIN swore at fans this week who were trying to get his autograph following a Coldplay gig in LA.Shocking, isn’t it  Who asks for an autograph these days How vintage. ORLANDO BLOOM will voice Prince Harry in a comedy cartoon called The Prince for US broadcaster HBO, which is set to poke fun at our calamitous royals.I hope the actor has put in the hours perfecting how to whinge relentlessly. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mostare controllable, but this time I am scared.The expert claims he had to escape Wuhan yesterday after witnessing the jaw-dropping lack of preventative measures enforced by local officials.Now several major cities, including the capital Beijing, have followed Wuhan in banning public gathering during the New Year celebrations.This is another sign that China is expanding its efforts to contain the virus which started last month – but is it too little too late Many residents in Wuhan think so.Social media users in the city have blasted authorities on Weibo for waiting weeks to put the metropolis on lockdown.Xiao, , a primary school teacher in Wuhan, told : When I saw the news when I woke up, I felt like I was going to go crazy. This is a little too late now. The government’s measures are not enough.Others criticised local authorities on the social media  Weibo as #PrayforWuhan was trending.One said: It’s been a month since the first case was discovered and only now do they think of closing the city  This Wuhan emergency response is a little slow, right   Another added: The government needs to address this. If things become too expensive, people will definitely panic and when people feel unsafe, terrible things happen. Right now people are fighting over supplies, soon they may just be fighting.”Locals have shared images of their stockpiles of instant noodles and snacks on the social media  Weibo.One wrote: No more going out ... so I won’t get sick. Hope Wuhan can get some support soon.It is unusual of citizens to express such outrage at the Chinese government on the countrys microblogging site.Supermarket shelves are empty as residents have started stockpiling goods to keep themselves isolated at home to avoid contracting the virus.Images shared online show food prices have spiked in Wuhan.Cake Liu left Wuhan last week after visiting her boyfriend there and said everything was normal then, things have changed rapidly.She said:didnt sleep much yesterday. He disinfected his house and stocked up on instant noodles. Hes not really going out. If he does he wears a mask.Police, SWAT teams and paramilitary troops have been out on the streets patrolling the railway stations as authorities have banned travelling on subways and ferries.The airport and train stations have been shut down to outgoing passengers travelling after am local time.Petrol stations have been rammed with motorists trying to get as much fuel as possible amid rumours reserves had run out.Pharmacies have sold out of face masks, residents said.An Irish teacher in Wuhan has describe the city as a ghost town as hes been hold up in his flat.Ben Kavanagh told RTE Radio’s Morning Ireland: “You are allowed out, but there are so many rumours and people are worried, it’s better not to.“It’s almost like a ghost town.I have enough water for a few more days, but I will probably have to head out to the shops for food.“I have no idea what to expect.Seven million people in Huanggang, which is  miles away, have been told not to leave after there were confirmed cases.Public transport stopped running at midnight local time.Dr W. Ian Lipkin, a US epidemiologist at Columbia University who advised China and the World Health Organisation during the SARS epidemic, said infected victims outside Wuhan would continue to spread the disease.He said: “The horse is already out of the barn.Coronavirus is an airborne virus, spread in a similar way to colds and the flu.The virus attacks the respiratory system, causing lung lesions.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract , it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.There is no vaccine for coronavirus.In  an outbreak of a similar virus, SARS, infected more than , people in  countries before it was brought under control, killing  of those worldwide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That windfall came to be dependent on Anthony Sootherans death. And she got impatient, and worried that the windfall might elude her.”He added: “With a view to securing his inheritance and with Wayne Rickard’s assistance, Lynda Rickard precipitated Anthony Sootheran’s death.“In short, for their own gain, they killed him by isolating him, neglecting him, failing to obtain appropriate medical help for him and depriving him of food and drink.“In short, they starved him to death.”Mr Saxby said the Sootherans, who had signicant land ownership in Yorkshire and “substantial savings and investments moved in with the Rickards, in , to be cared for.Mary Sootheran died aged  in August , and the couple continued to care for Mr Sootheran.But when a doctor called at the farm they shared in South Newington, Oxfordshire, on March  , she discovered Mr Sootheran dead in his bed with sores.The jury heard Mrs Rickard admitted to using between £, to £, worth of Mrs Sootherans money as her own and £, to £, of Mr Sootherans “over a period of time”.The jury were told she had previously pleaded guilty to four fraud charges, two counts of forgery, two counts of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and possession of articles for use in fraud.Mrs Rickard is further charged with the manslaughter of Mr Sootheran through gross negligence and also abusing her position as carer by using his money for her own purposes.Mr Rickard, , is accused of causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable adult.The couple are both accused of a single count of fraud by  representation relating to Mrs Sootheran.Michael Dunkley, , of Bloxham, Oxfordshire, and Denise Neal, , of Lower Tysoe, Warwickshire, are charged with one count of fraud by  representation after allegedly claiming Mr Sootheran’s will was genuine.Shanda Robinson, , of Banbury, Oxfordshire, is charged with one count of fraud by  representation claiming Mary Joy Sootheran’s will was genuine and witnessed in her presence.Mrs Robinson is also accused of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.All five defendants deny all the outstanding charges against them. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mostare controllable, but this time I am scared.The expert claims he had to escape Wuhan yesterday after witnessing the jaw-dropping lack of preventative measures enforced by local officials.Now several major cities, including the capital Beijing, have followed Wuhan in banning public gathering during the New Year celebrations.This is another sign that China is expanding its efforts to contain the virus which started last month – but is it too little too late Many residents in Wuhan think so.Social media users in the city have blasted authorities on Weibo for waiting weeks to put the metropolis on lockdown.Xiao, , a primary school teacher in Wuhan, told : When I saw the news when I woke up, I felt like I was going to go crazy. This is a little too late now. The government’s measures are not enough.Others criticised local authorities on the social media  Weibo as #PrayforWuhan was trending.One said: It’s been a month since the first case was discovered and only now do they think of closing the city  This Wuhan emergency response is a little slow, right   Another added: The government needs to address this. If things become too expensive, people will definitely panic and when people feel unsafe, terrible things happen. Right now people are fighting over supplies, soon they may just be fighting.”Locals have shared images of their stockpiles of instant noodles and snacks on the social media  Weibo.One wrote: No more going out ... so I won’t get sick. Hope Wuhan can get some support soon.It is unusual of citizens to express such outrage at the Chinese government on the countrys microblogging site.Supermarket shelves are empty as residents have started stockpiling goods to keep themselves isolated at home to avoid contracting the virus.Images shared online show food prices have spiked in Wuhan.Cake Liu left Wuhan last week after visiting her boyfriend there and said everything was normal then, things have changed rapidly.She said:didnt sleep much yesterday. He disinfected his house and stocked up on instant noodles. Hes not really going out. If he does he wears a mask.Police, SWAT teams and paramilitary troops have been out on the streets patrolling the railway stations as authorities have banned travelling on subways and ferries.The airport and train stations have been shut down to outgoing passengers travelling after am local time.Petrol stations have been rammed with motorists trying to get as much fuel as possible amid rumours reserves had run out.Pharmacies have sold out of face masks, residents said.An Irish teacher in Wuhan has describe the city as a ghost town as hes been hold up in his flat.Ben Kavanagh told RTE Radio’s Morning Ireland: “You are allowed out, but there are so many rumours and people are worried, it’s better not to.“It’s almost like a ghost town.I have enough water for a few more days, but I will probably have to head out to the shops for food.“I have no idea what to expect.Seven million people in Huanggang, which is  miles away, have been told not to leave after there were confirmed cases.Public transport stopped running at midnight local time.Dr W. Ian Lipkin, a US epidemiologist at Columbia University who advised China and the World Health Organisation during the SARS epidemic, said infected victims outside Wuhan would continue to spread the disease.He said: “The horse is already out of the barn.Coronavirus is an airborne virus, spread in a similar way to colds and the flu.The virus attacks the respiratory system, causing lung lesions.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract , it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.There is no vaccine for coronavirus.In  an outbreak of a similar virus, SARS, infected more than , people in  countries before it was brought under control, killing  of those worldwide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Janis Winehouse delivered a ,-signature petition to Downing Street, with campaigners demanding action from the Prime Minister. They are calling on Mr Johnson to fix the process for claiming Personal Independence Payments . The benefit, which replaces Disability Living Allowance, is designed to help with the extra costs of a long-term health condition or disability. But there are concerns about the assessment process and the complexity of forms. Mrs Winehouse, who has secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, said she wanted to “support the people living with MS whose voices still aren’t being heard”. The late singer’s mother added: “Some of my closest friends have been through the exhausting and demoralising process of claiming PIP and it can’t go on any longer. “MS is relentless, painful and disabling, and right now PIP is costing many people their independence rather than giving it to them.” After handing over the petition on her th birthday, she blasted how “disgusting it is” that applicants are interviewed by people “with no knowledge of the condition”. While she has not personally suffered dficulties with PIP, her friends have seen “absolute horrors”. Ms Winehouse urged the PM: “Please help us - get the Health Minister to listen and understand what we are saying.” MS Society head of campaigns Jonathan Blades said: “The UK’s welfare system is in crisis, leaving thousands of disabled people suffering as a result. “A process that was designed to protect society’s most vulnerable is now too often doing the opposite.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailEmily Thornberry declares she is more radical than Jeremy Corbyn as she outlined a bold plan for housing reform.The Labour leadership contender’s idea is a lottery in each council area for -somethings who want to live in a subsidised block of flats.Her plan would involve charging tenants up to half their salary - rather than the exorbitant more than two-thirds many are forced to shell out. Thornberry says that they would have to move out as soon as they turned  but it would give them the time to save up for a deposit. She believes the scheme would “begin to change the conversation”. “I thinkwe started building blocks like that you’d start getting people in their s actually quite interested in housing policy and local councils and turning up at Town Halls and going ‘that block of flats for  year old, it’s full build another one’ and it will be really popular,” she said. She added: “Youngsters aren’t priority need when it comes to council housing so you can’t get a council house and they can’t afford to buy. “So they end up in the private rented market and in very many areas, it’s so expensive that they can’t rent a house by themselves and they can’t get the security that they need in order to be able to set up a family.” She told the Mirror: “Part of the problem when it comes to housing is that people have such a lack of confidence in government they don’t believe that such a major problem can actually be addressed by government - that’s why it’s so important that we put forward real ideas.” The London MP also vowed a crackdown on empty properties, saying “you use it or you lose it” in a similar way to dormant bank accounts. There are , empty households and , have been empty for more than six months. She said: “You go down the Thames at night, and you see all these luxury flats and none of them got the lights on and they’re laughing at the people sleeping in doorways.” Other plans include stopping land banking by developers who sit on plots by helping them to build so long as it’s affordable housing or council housing. Andthey don’t build within five years then it gets taken over by the council. She said: “We have to be radical and we have to be not afraid.”  She said: “People say ‘do you agree with everything in Jeremy’s manesto’ I say yeah yeah but it is a question of priorities and, you know, and they also say ‘are you in any way more radical than Jeremy ’ maybe I am in some ways and when it comes to housing I am. And in my burning desire to sort out social care. I’m probably, you know, quite radical about that too.”Thornberry, who holds the neighbouring seat to Jeremy Corbyn, has struggled to find her place in the contest with Keir Starmer already occupying a lot of the London Remainer MPaposs natural territory.She said: “People say ‘do you agree with everything in Jeremy’s manesto’ I say yeah yeah but it is a question of priorities and, you know, and they also say ‘are you in any way more radical than Jeremy ’ maybe I am in some ways and when it comes to housing I am. And in my burning desire to sort out social care. I’m probably, you know, quite radical about that too.”  Unlike many Labour politicians Thornberry, who has been an MP since  does not oppose Right to Buy which was introduced by Margaret Thatcher. My mum never bought our council house - she didnapost believe in the right to buy, she said. But as I said to her, itaposs all very well for you, Mum, is because you got a rich daughter who will buy your flat. We gave our council house back to the council and she felt very strongly that we have been saved by a council house and we wanted to make sure that there was a council house available for another family. I think Iaposd take a slightly dferent view, which is, I donapost mind people buying their council houses, so long as the money coming from the council houses are then used to build another one, you know like for like, so long as the councilaposs housing stock doesnapost isnapost depleted whataposs the problem   The shadow foreign secretary - who is yet to make it on the ballot paper for Labour members - is unlikely to get the trade union backing and instead will be relying on the nominations of local Labour parties. She described the two frontrunners Rebecca Long-Bailey and Keir Starmer as machine politicians and hinted that her rivals had their minds on the leadership during the elction.She admitted: I’m a bit of a late starter in that I didn’t start my campaign to launch the general election and so I did go from literally a standing start.“I think the way it’s turning out is that we seem to have kind of sort of two machine, sort of politicians, and, you know, we’ve got one who’s perceived to be on the left and one who’s perhaps perceived to be more on the right, and they had these great monolithic campaigns and, you know, and there’s a bit of a squeeze going on in the middle but in the end, it’s up to the members to decide.” But despite lagging behind Keir Starmer and Long-Bailey, both Thornberry and underdog Lisa Nandy fared well when Channel Four asked a focus group of former Labour voters who theyaposd vote for. Asked why she cuts through she replied: Itaposs authenticity. Itaposs speaking from the heart. Itaposs saying what you mean and meaning what you say, you know, itaposs basic really.  Thornberry has argued against the navel-gazing which the Labour Party often indulges in when a leader quits. She said: I donapost think that we need to have some sort of existential crisis about who we are, we all know who we are. But what we need to do is we need to do it in a way which is competent and, and so that people believe because itaposs all very well are saying there is another way it doesnapost have to be like this. Butpeople donapost believe that we can deliver it. I meanthey say well you canapost even solve anti- Semitism, you know, how can you deliver, you know, hundreds of thousands of homes that we need in this country.  Asked what Thornberryism means, she said: What we want is - and I think itaposs actually what the British people want is they want Britain to be a place where we look after each other when they are down on their luck. Unlike much of the doom and gloom in the party, Thornberry thinks there is a positive future for Labour. I think that whoever is the new leader, there will be a huge amount of goodwill towards them. Thornberry, who has been critical of people surrounding the leadership, has vowed to have a clear outshe wins. But she has also said she would end the factionalism that has blighted the party for the last few years. So, you have to have a Shadow Cabinet and front bench which is populated by people who are good. And they arenapost there because theyaposve come from one particular faction or another particular faction.  We need to bring all our talent together and they do them they are lots of dferent people from all over the country, lots of dferent types of people. And they come from dferent wings. Because in the end, you know, I mean we may disagree on % will we agree on %.  And it really doesnapost it isnapost necessary. I mean I do I feel I come from the heart of the party I have never been factional, I never would be. Although she refuses to promise people jobs she strongly hinted this could mean her leadership rivals serving alongside her on the frontbench. I think that we are quite a team, potentially, and we have a lot to do. And weaposve got to make sure that we use all all of our talents. What happens is that whenever thereaposs a new leader elected they bring in their own people. And yes, thataposs what I would do, too. Iaposm not somebody who briefs, and I donapost leak - the criticisms that I have an accident open. People know what it is that I disagree on yeah and Iaposve been straight about it. And I will expect people to behave like that when Iaposm a leader as well. You know,youaposve got something to say say it to my face.

The ex-Speaker went to war with Downing Street as he complained No had no intention of honouring the centuries-old convention of putting him in the Lords. A Downing Street source hit back: As Speaker, he wasnapost always as concerned with convention. Mr Bercowaposs hopes of a peerage were hurled into doubt after the former Clerk of the House - the most senior Commons official - filed a formal bullying complaint. Lord Lisvane handed a dossier of allegations to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, which the Mirror understands alleges both he and former colleagues were bullied. The document - whose existence was revealed by The Times - is said to accuse Mr Bercow of having bullied and humiliated staff, including using inappropriate language. In a y statement today, Mr Bercow categorically denied bullying and hit out at the timing of the complaint. He said: It has become increasingly obvious that the Government has no intention of honouring the centuries old convention that a departing Speaker is promptly elevated to the House of Lords. Indeed, it has been suggested to me that the Government actively seeks to block any other attempt to nominate me for membership of the Upper House. I have seen in the media that Lord Lisvane is formally complaining that I bullied staff. For the record, I categorically deny that I have ever bullied anyone, anywhere at any time. He said Lord Lisvane had ample opportunity to raise concerns in the five years they worked together and never did so.  Moreover, as Chief Executive of the Commons and Head of the House Service, he had a duty of care to all House staff, Mr Bercow said. Therefore, he had not merely a right but a responsibility to acthe thought that he witnessed misconduct. Even though he frequently disagreed with me on a wide range of issues, he did not once complain to me and neither did any other official on his behalf. He added: In  years as a Member of Parliament and over  years as Speaker, I was fortunate to work with superb staff who served me to great effect. They were loyal to me and I was similarly loyal to them. I was elected as Speaker on a  of reform and modernisation. The vast majority of people I interacted with strove unsparingly to support my change agenda. There is no secret that a small minority did not.  Labour are thought to have nominated John Bercow for a peerage after he was snubbed by Downing Street.But No questioned the nomination, saying the convention would be for Bercow - a former Tory - to be nominated by his own party. Tory Andrea Leadsom, who clashed with Mr Bercow when she was Leader of the House, said today any proven allegations should have an impact on the decision to give him a peerage. Any new peers have to be cleared by the House of Lords Appointments Commission, which can block the £-a-day job. She told Sky News: “When I was leader of the Commons we worked cross party very hard to create a harassment and bullying complaints helpline.

However, I was ­incensed by the ­posturing Laurence Fox, proving that empty vessels really do make most noise. The shoot-from-the-lip actor sounds a real bigot with the stupid assertion that Sam Mendes’ Oscar-nominated war epic  is “institutionally racist” and “forcing ersity” because it includes a turbaned Sikh soldier in the trenches. Having studied for my MPhil in History, let me give Fox a British history lesson. The scion of a distinguished family – who ranted on Question Time last week that to call him a “white privileged male” was racist – he is either forgetting what he wastaught at Harrow School, or his parents wasted a small fortune sending him there.  I, proud to be the first turbaned Sikh elected to sit in the House of Commons, as Labour MP for Slough in Berkshire, will take no lessons in patriotism or military service from a thespian blinkered by prejudice.My grandfather’s brother, my grandmother’s brother and another family member all fought voluntarily for Great Britain. One lost a leg. We know the price of freedom, including a defence of freedom of expression. Here are a few facts for floundering Fox to learn before –he’s a man of honour – issuing an unqualied apology. More than . million people from what is modern-day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh rallied to the cause and took up arms in what was the largest volunteer army in history. Sikhs, famed around the globe for their military tradition, made up only % of the population of British India – yet they formed % of the British Indian Army during the First World War. More than , turbaned Sikh soldiers laid down their lives and more than , were injured during the First and Second World Wars. The acts of bravery were exceptional – Victoria and Military Crosses were won. Sikhs lived and died on the Western Front, just like troops born in Slough and Sunderland, Stirling and Swansea.  Their blood was spilled too at Gallipoli and on the Somme. Their families too received the telegrams informing them a beloved husband, son and brother would neverhome. Their bodies too were lost to the end of time, blown to smithereens by German shells or landmines.These facts might be inconvenient for Fox’s distorted view, but they are veriable facts, as photographs from the conflict testy. It is why a motion I tabled in the last Parliament, which “appreciates the extraordinary bravery and sacrice of Sikh soldiers in service of Great Britain, including during both World Wars”, was signed by -plus MPs from all parties – a record for that parliamentary session – including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the Father of the House and leaders of all opposition parties. I fear for the safety of anybody standing near Fox when he discovers our campaign for a war memorial in central London to turbaned Sikh soldiers has succeeded. Plans for a statue in a very prominent place are to be unveiled shortly. In Gravesend, Kent, thanks to a community campaign I led, there is already a statue to Squadron Leader Mahinder Singh Pujji DFC. He was a turbaned Sikh Hurricane pilot, who took on Hitler’s Luftwaffe and survived several crashes.I applaud Sam Mendes for making a start by including at least one Sikh on the Western Front when in our arts and culture, and particularly our war movies, there is a noticeable lack of black and brown faces. Fox is guilty of inciting a poisonous culture war on steroids, imitating the toxic tactics of Donald Trump.Whitewashing history is a crime against the truth isive tactics betraying the fair play and decency of the overwhelming majority of our country who appreciate a rich tapestry. Telling the truth about Sikhs and others in the military, including Muslims, Hindus and Black soldiers from the Caribbean and Africa, is to pay tribute to that past, to shape the present and future.

John Leonard had traumatic head injuries and died at Hull Royal Infirmary on July , . Known as Lenny to his friends, he had served as a carpenter in the Royal Engineers, and was described by his ex-partner as a “genuinely nice guy”. John’s best friend Michael Cox had spent the day drinking with him on the day of his fall and described his mate as a man with “no enemies”.On Friday, July , , John and Michael started their drinking session at noon, Hull Live reports.The inquest heard the pair drank lager together regularly in the city centre bars and that John’s drink of choice was Carling. Between the hours of pm and pm, John drank between  and  pints of beer while the pair socialised with friends in Hull’s “new town”. Mike said: “We could drink, we could drop them. It could have been  pints.” At the end of their evening, the friends parted ways to head home. Mike said: “I offered to walk with him but he was a proud man and wasn’t having any of it.” At around pm, a woman, who had been searching for her missing cat, was driving slowly when she spotted John “laid in the middle of the road”. He was breathing heavily but unresponsive. Another resident came outside and tried to help move John from the road but found he was bleeding from the back of his head. Emergency services attended the scene and John was taken to  Hull Royal Infirmary where he received emergency surgery in the early hours of Saturday morning.But he never recovered from the injuries and on Wednesday, July , John began palliative care, dying two days later. A criminal investigation was launched into the circumstances surrounding his injuries but was later dropped after police obtained CCTV footage showing John falling into the road. Mike added: He was a great loyal friend and always enjoyed a drink. Although he lived alone, he liked to be with his mates and have a laugh.

Footage of the incident went viral and the officer was charged with assault by beating following an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

It’s a tribute to people with Down’s syndrome, and to the fact they have a chance extra copy of ­chromosome . Fragile X, a smoky .% porter, is also the name of a genetic condition that can lead to someone having learning disabilities. Meanwhile, Spectrum refers to autism. Undiagnosed, a hoppy beer, is there to “raise ­awareness of all those out there unable to get a diagnosis”. All of the beers are a source of pride to Spotlight’s workforce on a converted farm in Goole in East ­Yorkshire. Neil Elston, , is part of the brewing team, spending two or three days a week making and monitoring the next batch. He has Down’s syndrome and loves making the beer, and especially tasting it. He also has his own shed there and is repairing paths around the site. Before the brewery, Kev McMinn, , was struggling after losing his mum. Now, he is smiling widely as he shows us how to test the beer and where dferent equipment is kept. “I was sad about mum,” he says. “But I’m a lot happier now.” He takes pride in keeping the place clean, scrubbing and sterilising giant steel kegs. Matthew Cottingham, , who also runs his own greetings cards business, is in charge of sales. “I love it,” he says. “It’s great having things to do.” His favourite part of the job is marketing the beers – visiting pubs and bars to sell them. Head brewer and support worker Ric Womersley, , was working at the residential centre next door when he had the idea of creating a micro brewery. “I do some home brewing and I thought this could be a way of us working together,” he says. “It’s all about having some fun and learning new skills.” The brewery started from scratch exactly two years ago. Spotlight was given an old storeroom rent free, which the team set about clearing and patching up. Then, when a brewery down the road folded, they were gted the equipment, and Ric used some of his own money to get them started. Now they sell  to  casks or kegs a month to nearby pubs, and as far afield as Swindon, Wiltshire, plus there are plans to open a tap room. Almost  miles south of Goole, in Sydenham, South London, Nick O’Shea at Ignition Brewery has taken the idea a step further. An economist who has volunteered at a local Mencap branch for  years, including running its Tuesday Club disco, Nick, , realised most of the people he volunteered with were unemployed. “I’d be talking to people about what I’d been up to, and when I asked the same question back people would say they hadn’t done anything,” he says. “I felt that wasn’t right, that I could help create more opportunities.” In , despite having no brewing experience, he won some small grants and set up the brewery. He put up posters for the Tuesday Club and gave jobs to the first five people who came forward. They all earn the London Living Wage. “We’re saying to people, ‘you’re worth £. an hour’,” he says. “People can have lots of needs butwe can meet them there’s no reason why we can’t become colleagues. We are all skilled and we all learn in dferent ways. “Benedict has very little speech but can fill a bar and draw people in with his high fives. Michaela is a great brewer. She’s a porter connoisseur who loves trains – specically watching old films of train journeys across the South East – and visits craft breweries in her own time. By trainpossible.”  He also introduces Chris, a brewer and bar worker who is also Ignition’s resident rapper and DJ. “He is also the strongest member of the Ignition team, which makes him indispensable in the brew room,” Nick says. He admits brewer and bar worker John tends to drink Ignition’s South of the River beer mixed with orange squash. “But despite John’s peculiar taste in drinks, he’s a valued member of the Ignition team and he excels at bottle-labelling,” Nick says. “His quality control is second-to-none and he puts the rest of the team to shame with his stealth, dedication and steady hand. He can also tell you about most television shows and music from the s and likes to put this knowledge to the test at quizzes.” "},{"url":null,"title":"earthquakes most likely uk after","story":"NewsWhere earthquakes are most likely to it UK after Teesside tremor rocked homesThe number of earthquakes in the UK hit a -year high last year, with more than  tremors in Blackpool, where many have blamed fracking for causing an increase in disturbancesShareCommentsByClaire MillerMatthew Dresch:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsBlackpool is the earthquake hotspot of the UK \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Residents were woken up by a loud bang and a aposshudderapos in Stockton-on-Tees this morning, leading some to fear that an asteroid had hit the area.However, it turned out to be just the latest in a series of increasingly frequent earthquakes to strike the UK. Blackpool, the earthquake capital of Britain, saw more than  tremors in , with many blaming the phenomenon on fracking. The Government stopped fracking across England in November, saying it would only allow its resumptioncommunities and scientists were in favour of it. In total, there were  earthquakes across the whole of the UK last year, the same amount as in , which was the last highest year on record. After todayaposs quake rocked homes in the north, here are the hot spots for seismic activity in the UK: Blackpool Up to November last year, Blackpool experienced  tremors, according to data from the British Geological Society . That is more than anywhere  in the UK and comes on top of  more in . Most of the earthquakes reported in the Blackpool area happened during fracking, a process that releases gas from shale rock. This included a . magnitude tremor in August.  The BGS said this quake had an intensity of six - meaning it would be felt by most people indoors and many outdoors and could cause minor damage such as small cracks and falling objects. The Oil and Gas Authority halted fracking indefinitely at Blackpoolaposs Preston New Road site following the August earthquake. The high number of tremors in Blackpool is likely also due to the string of BGS monitoring stations in the area. Surrey The area around Newdigate, in Mole Valley, Surrey, witnessed  earthquakes up to November last year, the BGS said. A . magnitude quake which struck Newdigate in February was dubbed the aposSurrey swarmapos. The BGS believes the tremors in Surrey are natural - in comparison to the ones linked to fracking in Lancashire.  There was a . magnitude quake on April , , followed by five others above . on the Richter scale. Seven of the earthquakes in the area were felt by residents, with some raising concerns that they could be linked to a nearby oil production operation. However, BGS found there was no link. The high number of seismic incidents in the area may also be due to the prevalence of BGS monitoring stations in the area.

Murderers, torturers, hardened criminals… but, to their mother, Violet, twins Ronnie and Reggie Kray were her “lovely boys”. It was a sentiment shared by the identical twins themselves. “They were classic narcissists... image was important to them,” says world renowned criminologist David Wilson, who took a fresh look at their le and crimes. Wilson, a professor of criminology at Birmingham University, adds: “The Krays were very able manipulators. “There is still a fascination with them and the organised crime associated with them from the s.” They were arguably the most notorious criminals of the decade, heading a criminal empire, built on intimidation and brutality. When they moved to Bethnal Green from nearby Hoxton as children, Ronnie and Reggie quickly became involved in juvenile crime. Both were promising amateur boxers. Yet this and National Service in the Army did little to instil discipline or control the violence that would become their trademark. In the s they first moved into “protection” – demanding money with menaces from businesses who would face brutal reprisals for not paying up. And it paid off handsomely for the twins. By the following decade, their Firm had spread its operations west, open gambling club Esmeralda’s Barn in wealthy Knightsbridge. There they wined and dined celebrities, including Judy Garland and Barbara Windsor flocked to the club.It is said Reggie, the charming one, could have been a straight businessman, but his brother’s psychotic tendencies made that impossible. Ronnie loved the gangster image, insisting the pair had identical suits and slicked-back hairstyles. Unlike most villains the pair revelled in the spotlight. “They came managed to create an image for themselves in a way that nobody  had done,” says criminology lecturer Dr Ruth Penfold-Mounce of York University. “Most criminals become famous when they get go to jail. They achieved it while they were still active.”  When rumours about homosexual Ronnie’s friendship with Lord Boothby surfaced in  he became front page news on the Sunday Mirror. A portrait of the twins taken by David Bailey cemented the twins’ position in the public consciousness. Despite their growing fame, they continued their reign of terror, seemingly beyond the reach of police. But the law finally caught up with them as their ruthlessness reached new heights.  First, Ronnie shot George Cornell in Whitechapel’s Blind Beggar pub in . “He was a drunkard and a bully and I done him,” Ronnie would later say. “Me – not my brother.” In December that year, the Krays, helped Frank Mitchell escape from Dartmoor Prison. Once out, they put him in a friend’s flat in East Ham. But Mitchell, known as the “Mad Axeman”, became hard to control. He disappeared without a trace. Then, in , Reggie murdered Jack “The Hat” McVitie, a minor member of the Firm who had failed to fulfil a contract to kill Leslie Payne."},{"url":null,"title":"hs2 costs spiralled because blundering","story":"NewsHS costs spiralled because of blundering ministers, watchdog rulesThe National Audit Office blasts the Government and HS Ltd after new estimates suggested the final cost of the controversial project could be £billionShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  JAN NewsProject chiefs and ministers have come under fire \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

I think the nearest Sainsbury’s is a couple of miles away so it’s not exactly close and we are certainly not competition. “I am just a small business owner trying to make a living. “People keep stopping in their cars to take pictures with the sign and I’ve had many nice comments. “I have heard nothing from a supermarket which has a similar name, so I see no problem with it. “It’s a dferent logo, a dferent colour, a dferent company. Its a completely dferent.  The former sandwich delivery driver, who opened the store last month, has even registered ‘Singh’sbury Local’ on Companies House. In  businessman Jel Singh Nagra renamed his North Tyneside shop Singhsbury’s. After Sainsbury’s threatened legal action, he renamed the store Morrisinghs – and Morrisons backed the idea.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailMeghan Markle was naive for thinking her role in the royal family came with instant popularity, a royal commentator has suggested. Royal commentator Omid Scobie said the Duchess believed there would be a honeymoon period after she joined the royal family - in which she would be allowed to falter and make mistakes. Speaking with fellow expert Victoria Arbiter on their Heripod podcast, he said there may have been unrealistic expectations from both Meghan and the royals when it came to her new role. The Duchess has come under a great deal of scrutiny since announced her plans to step back from the Firm along with husband Prince Harry . Both are due to leave from their roles as senior royals and give up their HRH titles. On Meghanaposs short time as a senior royal, Omid said: I think one of the biggest mistakes Meghan made, and I’ve heard this from sources close to her, is that she naively went in thinking this role came almost with an instant popularity, he said on the Heirpod podcast.you start in a good place and there is this, no matter what, there is a honeymoon period that comes with marrying into the royal family that allows you to falter at times, or figure something out, or whatever it is. I think that that was one of the key things, and I think that towards the end she felt she wasnapost given that by the press or members of the royal family, by aides or courtiers within the households.  I think everyone somehow had this level of expectation from her from the get-go that was perhaps somewhat unrealistic, and perhaps she herself had some unrealistic expectations from the role too. Omidaposs comments mirror those made by Meghan herself in the ITV documentary Harry  Meghan: An African Journey. In the programme the Duchess spoke about how the intensity of the media scrutiny had caught her off guard and that she naively didnapost foresee what was to come. Speaking to Tom Bradby, she said: I never thought that this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair and thataposs the part thataposs really hard to reconcile.  Harry and Meghanaposs announcement that they plan to step back from the royal family and move to Canada is their bid to move out of the spotlight. Once their departure from the royal front line is complete in the spring, they will spend more than half of their time in the North American country.

Tina McGuire, , was brought to court over a Facebook post she shared in February  comprising the photo of a man and a caption purporting to identy the man in the picture as Venables. Alongside the picture McGuire posted the message: share before Facebook removes it....meet AKA John Venables. Venables and his accomplice, Robert Thompson, were each detained at Her Majestyaposs Pleasure in  after the pair were convicted of murdering two-year-old James Bulger - after first abducting him in Bootle. The two boys, who were aged just ten at the time, became the youngest murderers in modern British history.  But they were released on licence in , since when a world-wide court injunction has been in force barring publishing any information that could identy them or their whereabouts in the interests of rehabilitation. Despite the ban several people have over the years claimed to have published information relating to the pair over the internet. In March last year Shameless star, Tina Malone, was handed an eight-month suspended prison term after sharing an apparent photo of Jon Venables online.  McGuireaposs case reached Londonaposs High Court as the Solicitor General, Michael Ellis QC, acted against her for contempt of court. Katherine Hardcastle, the Solicitor Generalaposs barrister, pointed out that the February  post was not an isolated incident, with McGuire having distributed a similar incendiary post three months earlier, purporting to identy an entirely dferent man as Venables. On  November  she made a post to her Facebook account which was a photograph of an adult man with accompanying text as follows: This is Jon Venables as he looks today. Share this image as much as possible as this photograph I posted this morning was removed, the barrister said. McGuireaposs November  post was extensively distributed, the court heard, being shared over , times and attracting , comments. McGuireaposs case came before Lord Justice Davis today, who noted that she was not being prosecuted for the November post - only over the February  post. He said it was worrying that the photos in the two dferent posts were clearly of dferent men, creating dangerous potential for the wrong man being identied as Venables.  McGuire, from south Wales, has a preoccupation with preventing child sex abuse and a particular interest in the Bulger case, said the judge. But she has now expressed remorse for her actions, also openly admitting her contempt of court. She appears to have withdrawn from all relevant campaigning groups and withdrawn from social media in this respect, said Lord Justice Davis. Thereaposs no evidence to suggest that serious harm, or any harm, appears to have been done to Venables or Thompson - or anyone  - due to her posting, he added.

Tilli Buchanan, , is battling criminal charges after being charged under Utahaposs lewdness law. She stripped down to her underwear and removed her bra after doing DIY in her garage with her husband. When his three young children asked why she was topless, she responded thather partner could go bare chested, she could too. It ended up in front of a court after the mum of the children - who were aged ,  and nine - complained to detectives. But the case has now started a legal row in the US, after a judge ruled that by exposing her breasts, Buchanan had broken the law. Legislation in Utah states that lewdness includes revealing “the female breast below the top of the areola”. Free the nipple campaigners have branded the law sexist, saying dferent standards are applied to men and women. But in a ruling this week, Judge Kara Pettit brushed away objections to the case being brought forward. Her ruling said: The Court finds the government has an important interest in enacting laws to protect the health, safety, welfare, and morality of children, and to prevent them from being exposed to lewdness.

Her racy snaps and videos have made her a huge hit online, but sheaposs still single and on the lookout for aposThe Oneapos. While her fans love her youthful looks, Gina says she actually thinks sheaposs rather odd looking. The mother-of-four and grandmother-of-one said: I wouldn’t describe myself as glamorous – I’d say I’m quite odd looking. But I am single right now. And sheaposs even offered some advice for anyone trying to impress her. She said: The best way to get my attention is to know a good grandma joke. Then they might be in with a fighting chance. American accents have always done it for me,” she tells us. I love guys who talk like Mathew McConaughey or Patric Swayze – I guess it’s that southern drawl, or charm. Or sometimes just a glint in the eye, that captures my attention.  Gina, who lives on the Gold Coast in Australia, has just helped raise , to aid rescue efforts for stricken wildle in the wildfires that have ravaged her native country. And she says she isnapost bothered by her hot gran nickname. She said: It was never a dream of mine to be labelled the ‘worlds hottest grandma’ That wasn’t even my idea.  But I do actually really love the label ‘grandma’, as I consider it the ultimate reward for raising happy, healthy children. It certainly does seem to raise eyebrows with people – all I do is sit back and laugh at it all.Last year Gina blasted Instagram after they banned her from posting some of her most saucy photos on the .One of her posts, which showed her completely naked with her long hair covered her breasts, was removed as it reportedly violated guidelines.She then posted the same picture on  Twitter  and it appeared to be deemed okay as she complained: This photo was just deleted by Instagram for contravention of community guidelines.

She said: This post met guidelines - Iaposm confused as to what the problem was with the photo. Itaposs pretty tame in comparison with a lot of posts on Instagram these days - it compiled with Instagramaposs nudity guidelines and showed nothing a swimsuit wasnapost show. So I feel it has been taken down for hypocritical reasons I canapost fathom - is it ageism, or because Iaposm a grandmother   Gina said she felt censorship on Instagram is a contentious issue as it has become aposauthoritative and dictatorialapos. She pointed out there were posts in which breasts were clearly on display which had not been removed. In its response to Gina, Instagram said the post breached guidelines on nudity and pornography. Gina explained: I have felt forced to take a stand as the aposworldaposs hottest grandmaapos, and show what is happening to me. Iaposm not only fighting for my rights, Iaposm fighting for everyone. Next censorship will tell us what we can and cannot write on Instagram and social media in general.  The rules are arbitrary and could even be seen as a form of bullying.

The Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan is now under scrutiny after Chinese officials said the coronavirus originated for wildle sold illegally at the food emporium – now labelled as “ground zero”. Photos taken before its closure in December show a price list of  exotic animals – from snakes to civet cats – were available for sale, says the South China Morning Post. The list included live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, koalas and game meats.“Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door,” said the price list for the vendor called Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Massesm, which also listed a price of  RMBfor koala meat. When asked about claims of a food market selling koalas, a Chinese community leader based in the UK told the Daily Mirror: “I doubt that it’s unlikely you would be able to smuggle them into China.” There were also reports of cages packed with porcupines on sale, alongside endangered pangolins. Sellers saying trade in wildle took place up until the market was shut for disinfection after the outbreak began. It has put the country’s poorly regulated wild animal trade, driven by demand for exotic delicacies and ingredients for traditional medicine, under the spotlight. Conservationists have long denounced the trade in wildle for its impact on bioersity and the potential for spreading disease. Wild, exotic and farmed animals are packed together, described as a breeding ground for disease and an incubator for a multitude of viruses to evolve and make the jump to humans. “The origin of the new coronavirus is the wildle sold illegally in a Wuhan seafood market,” Gao Fu, director of China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Preliminary research suggested that the Wuhan virus was passed on to humans from snakes.  But government medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, also identied badgers and rats as possible sources. It is understood a number of the early sufferers of the coronavirus were employees of the wet market. Hu Xingdou, an independent political economist, said Chinese people’s love for eating wildle had deep cultural, economic and political roots. He said: “While the West values freedom and other human rights, Chinese people view food as their primary need because starving is a big threat and an unforgettable part of the national memory.”  The Cultural Revolution, lasting from  to , a period of political and social chaos caused by Chairman Mao, saw two million people die and millions more left battling starvation. It followed a widespread famine between  and  estimated to have killed tens of millions of people. A large Chinese city can have a few hundred wet markets, the main outlets for poultry and meat.  Many cities including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Beijing have banned sales of live poultry and animals in their downtown area. But the markets are still common across the country. While most urban homes now have refrigerators, many in rural areas and low income urban renters still do not own one. Mr Hu added: “While feeding themselves is not a problem to many Chinese nowadays, eating novel food or parts from rare animals or plants has become a measure of identity to some people.” Trafficking of wild species requires special licenses but regulations can be loosethey are commercially farmed. Bats are thought to have spawned the coronavirus SARS, which in  - killed hundreds of people in Asia.

Daria, , and Ivan, , have appeared on TV in Russia ahead of their babyaposs arrival to share details of their relationship. According to the children they met each other a year ago and fell in love at first sight. Daria, who is just eight weeks pregnant, said during the On Air show, which they appeared on with parental permission: A friend of mine introduced us and two days later we started dating. Ivan said he was in love with me. We tried to spend as much time together as we could. We like walking down the streets holding hands and kissing. But there are some questioning whether the -year-old boy could have fathered a baby at all. Local paediatrician Nikolai Skorobogatov said: Theoretically both children could have reached reproductive age. But Dr Evgeny Grekov, a urology and andrology expert, says Ivan could not be the father. He said: We rechecked the laboratory results three times so there cannot be any mistake. There cannot be sperm cells. He is still a child.  There is even no testosterone. And just to add, he still has childish sex organs. Puberty has not started. So we have a lot of questions. According to the girl, who is planning on keeping the child, she and her boyfriend take care of each other and set their social media as aposmarriedapos. The schoolgirl said: Ivan has gastritis and I do not allow him to drink carbonated beverages. Sometimes I worry about my weight but he says that I am in perfect shape and do not need to go on a diet. He is very kind. Daria revealed that she and Ivan had sex at his home when his mother was away. She said: After we did it for the first time, we hid from each other under the blanket out of shame. Soon after Daria started to feel sick and had nausea most days. The girl’s mother Elena took her to hospital for examinations but doctors failed to find the cause of her aposillnessapos. Finally, Elena bought a pregnancy test kit for her daughter. Elena, who was also participating in the show, said: The test showed that Daria was pregnant. After that, she confessed to having sex with Ivan.  I was in shock. I could not say a word. When we started talking she said she would not kill the baby and I support her decision. I do not want her to go under the kne. Ivan and his mother Galina, , are planning to help Daria to raise the child. Galina said: I did not know what to say after learning that my -year-old son fathered a child. I think Ivan himself does not quite understand what happened. He said they came to our apartment and Daria offered him to have sex.  They did not use any contraceptives and obviously did not realise the possible consequences. Some of the familiesapos neighbours express doubts over whether the boy is indeed the father. A man living next door said: I think somebody  got the girl pregnant and now they want to put all the responsibility on the boy. And a woman said: I do not believe the boy is the father of the child. I doubt he is developed enough for that. Father-to-be Ivan said: Daria has never been with another man. I know that for sure. I am the father of her baby.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

But what it will be is something that is modular that we can add ontowe need to for capacity and we will want to talk to the community about what  we might want to put into that site.A consultation will take place asking for local feedback on community space and the possible provision of health and social care.She added: ldquoSome people have said to me that they want to knock all of the school down including the fairly new bits, realistically that wonrsquot happen and itrsquos not the right thing to do. I think itrsquos important that we make sure people understand the parameters within which we are working so we can have some sensible conversations and that we try and accommodate as much as we can in there.Meanwhile, a major operation is underway to get the students back to their classrooms at the beginning of February.The Chief Executive said: ldquoWe put in arrangements for  plus pupils to be accommodated at locations in Peebles, Galashiels Academy and the Langlee complex.ldquoThat has been generally very successfully and the feedback from that has been positive. I absolutely acknowledge that itrsquos not perfect but it has done the job we needed it do to.Senior students are currently sitting prelim exams in the Sports Complex and this will continue until the end of January.Temporary classroom units are being erected within the school grounds and pupils are to be accommodated in unaffected areas of the building.ldquoThere are still huge amounts of work going on and we will go right up to the wire but Irsquom confident we will achieve it, added Ms Logan.The Council has decided on a phased approach with S to S students starting on Monday, February  and S to S working from home and ing the following day.Ms Logan said that there has been ldquocompromises in the education offer over the last few weeks but is assuring parents that from the beginning of February it will be ldquobusiness as usual.Demolition work on the damaged building has been completed and restricted access has been implemented.The council boss has assured parents that children will only be able to access safe routes throughout the school building.Ms Logan added: ldquoOne of the things we did lose in the fire was the vast majority of pupil toilets so what wersquove now got on site is the long term temporary arrangements supplemented over the course of January.To ensure pupil safety, traffic will enter the site from a new access via Craigerne Road located at the back of the school.Ms Logan is meeting with insurers this week to discuss a settlement figure which will help form the direction of the future of Peebles High School.She added: ldquoAll of what we are doing is going to be sustainable for whatever we do in terms of the proper rebuild.\"What Irsquom trying to reassure you is that wersquore not doing things that are very temporary, whatever we do, we will be looking to the future.Community councillor Graham Mackie commended the local authority on doing a ldquoremarkable job and said any criticism of the Council during this trying time was unnecessary.He said: ldquoIt has been thought for several years that we needed a completely new high school but possibly therersquos a silver lining here in that we can end up with a high school that will meet the needs of the current population.\"But the council chief told members that ldquoessentially this is the replacement.She explained: ldquoWhen it comes to looking at high schools and replacement we would always look to retain what is still workable.\"In the case of the bits we are talking about in terms of Peebles High site they are really not that old.

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall. A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat.

This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness. But the seat, the box and most of all the stories, stopped Jessicarsquos nana from melting."},{"url":null,"title":"bypass-old-craighall-sheriffhall-shuts-two-nights","story":"Maintenance workwill take place on the A eastbound carriageway from Wednesday until Friday next week , betweenpm and ameach night.To allow the workto take place, there will be a full closure of the A eastbound carriageway between Sherfhall and Old Craighall.

But Scotland could still offer the national income of Portugal with the population of Slovakia.:Nicola Sturgeon to set out plan for Scottish independence referendum next weekSo, we can forget the  nonsense about going to the end of the queue or being blocked by Spain. There is now a reservoir of goodwill, especially in the European Parliament, following Scotlandrsquos determined resistance to Brexit. Wersquod be back in, probably within - years according to Kirsty Hughes of the Scottish Centre on European Relations.However, there is one small problem. Scotland would have to be fully independent first. Unless Scotland has a referendum in this transition year there is no longer any prospect of Scotland, as it were, remaining in the European Union as rUK leaves. We may still be under the same regulatory environment as Europe in the transition period, but donrsquot think that can just be extended as in Northern Ireland.Mentioning the Irish backstop is not the way to get a sympathetic hearing in the European Union. Many states are unhappy about Northern Ireland being allowed to remain, effectively, in the European single market without being part of the EU or the EEA.It breaks all the rules. And Scotland can forget about being given similar treatment. Speaking to Brussels officials this week confirms that there will be no read-across to Scotland from the Northern Ireland protocol. They wonrsquot even discuss it.So, there is no half way house. Scotland needs to take the leap into full independence. That means having a central bank and an autonomous currency before Scotland could become a candidate for accession. There are two problems here, but they arenrsquot insurmountable.Scotland would have to formally agree to the Maastricht Treaty, and membership of the euro. It is most unlikely that Scotland would get a formal opt-out from the euro, but it could drag its feet for a very long time, like Sweden. Whether Scotland would want to is another matter. Euro membership has worked well for many small countries.A more dficult issue is convergence. Scotland would have to show that its economy meets the terms of the stability pact, which means having a deficit of less than three per cent. At present, according to the GERS figures, Scotland has a deficit of more than twice that.However, after independence these numbers would almost certainly change. There will be a lot of fiscal give and take between Scotland and the rest of the UK over assets and liabilities.But Scotland would have to show that it is capable of harnessing its currency to the euro, evenit doesnrsquot actually join it. Currency autonomy might be hard to establish , as in the Scottish Governmentrsquos scenario, Scotland keeps using the pound for a decade after independence.: In post-Brexit Britain, Nicola Sturgeon cant keep telling her troops that Indyref is round the corner. It isntIf a nominally independent Scotland were still subject to interest rates operating in a country that is outside the European Union, that would be a dficult sell. The EU is very good at finding novel ways to get round problems like this. But it might take a few years.There may be a trade deal on regulations between the UK and the EU that solves some of Scotlandrsquos accession and border problems. We just donrsquot know. This is one of the imponderables of Scottish independence. It is actually very dficult to make a clear prospectus for indyref when we donrsquot yet know how the UK is going to stand in relation to the EU.But there is a bigger question than all of these: would Scotland necessarily want to rejoin the European Union  Nicola Sturgeon takes it as read, but there would be a debate at the very least. Around a million Scots voted for Brexit and many of them were supporters of independence.Brussels has had some bad press in the last decade. Austerity policies were imposed after  which were worse than in the UK and caused problems across the Mediterranean states. Its behaviour toward Greece during the sovereign debt crisis would have shamed the British Empire at its worst.Brussels stood idly by while one member state, Spain, imposed draconian repression in Catalonia, breaking heads and locking up elected politicians. There was scarcely a word from Brussels, let alone sanctions. Then there is fish.Many in the independence movement believe the EU is a neoliberal club ndash which it is ndash and would be happier with an arrangement like Norwayrsquos which has control of fishing grounds, is not subject to EU rules and has a managed economy. The case for a referendum before Scotland rejoined the EU would seem to me to be unanswerable.At the very least, the SNP could not take it for granted. Unionists will continue to argue that it makes little economic sense for Scotland to leave the Union with the UK, which is where the majority of Scottish exports go. There would be a hard border, currency controls, possibly tarfs.Ms Sturgeonrsquos problem is that the very arguments the SNP used against leaving the European Union ndash freedom of movement, zero tarfs, regulatory harmony ndash apply equally to leaving the United Kingdom. Theyrsquoll come winging back. Aversion to Boris Johnson may not be enough to persuade Scots to take the biggest leap in  years.Read more: Sturgeon cant keep telling her troops that Indyref is round the corner"},{"url":null,"title":"right-call-time-mistakes-past","story":"If you want to be truly up to the minute on the decorating front, how about putting the head of an ldquoold, white man with reactionary views above the fireplace The description comes from a film critic for the German paper Tagesspiegel, reacting to the news that the British actor Jeremy Irons has been made president of the Berlin Film Festivalrsquos international jury.Irons is the latest high profile figure to finds his past comments chasing him like The Mummy in a old horror film.On women, Irons is on record as telling the Radio Times: ldquoIf a man puts his hand on a womanrsquos bottom, any woman worth her salt can deal with it. Itrsquos communication. Canrsquot we be friendly :Alison Rowat: I spy with my little eye, an excitable Tennant gushing about the jungleThen there was another comment, this time to the Huffington Post, about gay marriage. Could a father not marry his son to dodge inheritance tax, Irons mused to the interviewer.The quotes unearthed, commentators rush to criticise the appointment, saying it sent the wrong message at a moment when the film festival, like the industry as a whole, was trying to reinvent itself.One observer said: ldquoIf [the festival] really cared about the necessary change in the film industry, they would not have chosen a jury chairman who has played down sexual harassment in the past, but a person who fights with determination for a non-violent and equal industry and world.Should Irons find himself promptly uninvitedhe could be a candidate for the ldquoold white man with reactionary views gallery.In recent months the place has been filling up fast. Before Irons, there was a push to have director Terry Gilliamrsquos head stuffed and stuck on the wall for telling The Independent that he was tired, ldquoas a white male of being blamed for everything that is wrong with the world. ldquoI didnrsquot do it! he pleaded.Another frequent resident of the trophy room is John Cleese, who has not said anything controversial for at least two minutes.Then there is Boris Johnson, the first among equals of oldwhite men with reactionary views. He has several claims to a space on the wall.Now, it is a tough gig trying to defend old white men with reactionary views. Poor souls. They have had things all their own way for thousands of years, and suddenly they are out in the cold, unloved, unwanted, called to account.In the case of Irons and Gilliam, it is dficult to understand why anyone would take the thoughts of actors and others in the entertainment industries seriously enough to be upset by them. These are people who play dress up for a living, and they get paid rather a lot for it .In the case of Irons, though, the plea in mitigation is not that hard to frame. The comments he has been slated for were made nine and seven years ago respectively.So what, you might think, they are still offensive. But the crucial dference here is that Irons has acknowledged he was a pillock , at least in the case of his comments on gay marriage, and moved on. As the row over the Berlin Festival shows, not everyone is prepared to do the same.Irons finds himself scolded because of our inability or unwillingness to leave a persons past behind, and our suspicion of those who change.:Alison Rowat: Chris has no easy answers about our crowded worldActors are particularly at risk of being lashed with old quotes because every time they are in something they have to publicise it. That means singing for their supper with interviews. If they are not to be insufferably boring or po-faced, which does not work either, they relax and go with the conversational flow.The industryrsquos classiest interview acts, the Helen Mirrens and Julie Walters and Roger Allams of the world, know this. They are perfectly capable, just like most non-actors, of chatting for  minutes without causing offence.Previously, only those who found themselves in the public eye had cuttings files. Now anyone who uses social media has a digital folder to lug around. Comments, photos, your past and present self is out there, and accessible at the click of a mouse. It is too late to close the box now.Knowing this, you might think people would be more forgiving and understanding of mistakes, butanything they are more condemnatory. Have evidence, will judge. Should people be allowed to draw a line under a comment  Cant there be a statute of limitations on being a numptie It depends. Politicians used to steer clear of digging up anything that happened before the age of , which seems reasonable.After that, it depends on what has been said, how recently, and how relevant it is to your current position. Some sentiments are stone cold wrong whenever they are expressed. See several of Boris Johnsonrsquos comments.He has dismissed these as just one of those things that happen when you write columns. They are not. Crucially, he has never said that he was wrong, which is reason enough to keep his head on the wall.By not having a statute of limitations on being a pillock we are saying that people are incapable of changing. What a dull, judgmental world it would bewe were to condemn people for ever and a day, despite, as in Ironsrsquo case, acknowledging that they were wrong.:The Andrew Marr Show reviewOne of the best things about the human species is its capacity for change. We need to believe that people can be better, can change their views and habits, otherwise we are all in trouble.As for Irons, he has done a pretty good job for the Berlin Film Festivalfor no other reason than people are talking about his association with it.Time, in this case, to forgive, forget and enjoy the movies."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10934080.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-fish-farm-blocked-claim-harm-sun-averse-fairies","story":"But a group has claimed that the protection of the magical aquatic creatures was a valid reason for opposing plans for a new fish farm on the Isle of Skye.And Highland Council planners have now blocked the  cage Organic Sea Harvest salmon farm.A group calling themselves the Flodigarry Fairies warned the Asrai - which they say have been in the waters off the Isle of Skye, Scotland for over , years - could die.They say the sprites are in ldquofear for their lives claiming the cages could draw the fairies to the surface and they would melt, in opposing the farm off Skyersquos north coast.:Over , salmon escape from Scottish fish farmAnd they even warned that workers could be put in danger as the mischievous water spirits ldquolure them with promises of gold and jewels into the deepest part of the ocean.Images of the plans were submitted to the councilAccording to folklore the asrai is a type of aquatic fairy that lives in seas, lakes and lochs and is similar to the mermaid and nixie.

They also raised concerns about chemicals used in the salmon farming industry.\"Fishermen lose more and more grounds to fish farms,\" the group say. Fishermen can no longer fish these areas, which leads to more dangerous situations as they cannot take shelter in these safe spots anymore.\"Smaller vessels are often family-businesses.

It represents something quite unsettling in society: the desire by adults to retreat into a world of childish preoccupations. The show began in South Korea in  and has swept the world with TV franchises across the globe.Adults have always enjoyed some flicker of childhood remaining in their lives. Whether itrsquos grown men playing with train sets, or families in the s watching Itrsquos a Knockout, or women dressing up like pink princesses on a hen night, or Generation Xers like me still playing computer games, the adult world has always contained a memory of childhood. Thatrsquos fine and good. We need to retain a little childhood silliness to stave off the calcication of the soul that accompanies being an adult.But over the last few decades, itrsquos sometimes seemed asthe adult world is more childlike than fully grown. It may have started with JK Rowling. Now donrsquot get me wrong, therersquos much to admire about Rowling. I adored reading her books to my children. She turned an entire generation into bookworms. God bless her for that, and I applaud her literary success.But in the late s, when I started to look up from my train seat and see grown men and women reading Harry Potter books, I despaired. I wasnrsquot expecting them all to be reading Crime and Punishment, but a book for an adult might have been nice. What were they doing retreating into a world of boy wizards and spells  If they wanted fantasy, therersquos plenty of adult fantasy out there.But it was cosiness they were craving. That was the key. They wanted comfort and safety ndash culture, art, literature, which did not challenge or threaten. They wanted childhoodrsquos comfort blanket.Then came the superhero movies ndash the endless, repetitive superhero movies. I should like these films. I grew up reading comics. But I hate the sight of superhero films today. Superheroes were for my childhood. I have no more need for superheroes and comics, than I have for a BMX and bunny hops in the park.Thatrsquos not to say there are no decent superhero movies ndash there are, though many also share the day-glo genetics of The Masked Singer, and are one endless round of jumping, punching, screeching, and bedazzling. I felt  percentage points of my IQ drop when I watched Thor.What Irsquom going to say next will get me burned as a heretic, but to hell with it, Irsquove gone this far. The same goes for Doctor Who. I loved it as a child, but I see no point in it for me as an adult.Itrsquos not that consuming any of these shows is ldquowrong as an adult. If you like to tune into The Masked Singer, or a superhero film, or the Doctor, thatrsquos fine with me. I watch crappy reality shows to switch off and unwind. Itrsquos the proleration and domination of these infantilising programmes which worries me. Childhood obsessions have moved from the fringes of the adult world to centre stage.:Neil Mackay: Why Iranian assassination crisis spells the end of American empireStrangely, or maybe not so strangely, this sht has accompanied a great easing in what it means to be an adult. Our lives are unimaginably softer and safer than our grandparentsrsquo lives.

It can take one big vessel and possibly a small vessel. But in my opinion, we could not facilitate to build two vessels that size so close together because the ground wasnrsquot sufficient enough.He said there was a plan, which he called ldquofine in concept, to build one hull on the slipway then launch it to make way for the completion of a second partly-built hull, but it didnrsquot work.The hulls were called  and .Mr Logan went on: ldquoWe started the  hull and it was moved to the side towards the castle side, and it was all kind of soft ground.ldquoIf you started putting hundreds of tons of units on that then itrsquos going to sink. It wasnrsquot sustainable to do that.ldquoFor the build schedule we had, we couldnrsquot have done it because it would come to a complete standstill on  while  was prepared for launch.He claimed said staff concerns had been dismissed by managers.He said: ldquoItrsquos plain to see ndash the size of the vessels that they were building, and the breadth of them on the berth, that the two vessels werenrsquot going to [fit].ldquoWe needed a mobile crane to go down in between them, and the space as you started building the two together, there wasnrsquot enough space.Askedthe workforce had warned managers about the looming problem, Mr Logan said: ldquoThe management team said they didnrsquot like our negativity.He also said managers caused problems by hiring agency workers to cope with the contract who arrived earlier on site than full-time staff and commandeered vital machinery.He said that left skilled welders with little work bar sweeping up.Mr Logan said design changes had been made ldquoconstantly and there was still not a finalised design for the boats.Without it, the work was ldquolike building a jigsaw when yoursquove got missing parts. Yoursquore never going to complete it.Mr Logan said CMAL and Ferguson managers ldquocame to loggerheads.He said: ldquoThey wouldnrsquot agree on the design so we couldnrsquot move forward, so it just came to a standstill. It was just a stand-off at the OK Corral. Who was going to cave in first He added: ldquoIt came to a situation that CMAL and our own management team couldnrsquot sit in the same building.ldquoThat started affecting the workforce, because the work stopped on the vessels.Mr Hair said the vessels were ldquosignicantly less than half-built, and % of the shipsrsquo design had not been agreed with CMAL, but that more naval architects and marine engineers had been hired to do this job.He said aspects of the design change process were a ldquomess, compounded by the breakdown in relations.He said: ldquoThere were some changes that were agreed but were not signed off because the relationship had broken down to the extent that they were unable to sit in the room, he said.He told sceptical MSPs it would cost poundm to finish the vessels, as they were ldquomuch further away from completion than they look from a distance.Even the one ferry in the water was ldquostill a very long way off completion.: Call for probe into CalMac ferries contractsThe cost of scrapping the ships and starting over again would not be ldquodramatically dferent from the poundm bill for completing the hulls, but would take more time, he explained.ldquoIt is a very signicant number but it is a number that has been based on as rigorous an assessment as wersquove been able to carry out.ldquoItrsquos one where I am confident we can deliver the two vessels for that amount.Tory committee member Peter Chapman said people would find it ldquoabsolutely incredible.He said: ldquoHow the heck do you get to poundm, which is more than what the original cost was to start from scratch with a pile of steel and nothing He added: ldquoThere are assets there and the final figure is now another pound million.ldquoI canrsquot get my head round why it is costing so much more to finish these vessels.LibDem MSP Mike Rumbles said: ldquoThis has been a catastrophic failure. For poundm we have got two-half finished hulks and a lot of red faced officials.ldquoThe Scottish Government need to come clean on what due diligence was done before a contract worth tens of millions was dished out.ldquoRight now there is no evidence that any lessons have been learned or that a nationalised shipyard will be run efficiently and effectively. This needs to be rapidly addressed.The SNP tried to distract from the criticism by criticising the committeersquos Tory chair Edward Mountain for askingHyundai in South Korea could have built the vessels quicker instead.Mr Hair said they indeed could have done it in under five years.Inverclyde SNP MSP Stuart McMillan said: ldquoThe Tories have presided over decades of decline in Clyde shipbuilding.

Rationing also generated thousands of enquiries, and bureaux persuaded the government to grant extra clothes coupons to pregnant women. The first CABs in  were in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Stirling and Dundee.Post-war period: Against expectations, the end of the war brought an increased demand. CABs dealt with more enquiries than at the height of the blitz. Housing problems and family breakdowns increased. To meet this demand, the number of CABs began to prolerate.The advent of Legal Aid and the NHS led to a surge in enquiries.s: Housing problems continued to grow as people struggled with the housing shortage, overcrowding, and the end of rent controls.Hire purchase promised le on the ‘never-never.’ For many this led to mounting debts.s: Rents were rocketing, yet many people were still living in slum conditions and homelessness was rising. By  housing problems accounted for a quarter of the . million problems dealt with by CABs across the UK.Divorce reform too led to a surge in enquiries, with family problems representing  per cent of the CAB workload.s: Family, housing and benefit problems remained the top priority, but the consumer boom saw personal debt soar too. Industrial change saw an increase in redundancies and workers’ rights issues.s: Consumerism brought with it two recessions and debt and benefit cases doubled. Employment enquiries rose by  per cent. But debt, stemming from easy credit, became the biggest CAB issue.s: Social security became the top issue and sharp rises in VAT didn’t help. Repossessions and homelessness increased.-: Payday loans, combined with a lack of affordable housing, caused unprecedented levels of debt. Welfare reform left many families in debt, with Universal Credit generating enormous numbers of enquiries."},{"url":null,"title":"good turnout for wildlife group event","story":"About  people attended the first meeting of the Bailies of Bennachie Wildle group recently.

In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Hands-on...Superintendent Sharon Comriehas worked for the SSPCA for an incredible  years.

I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

I was surrounded by a phenomenal group of kind and supportive people from all walks of le who had me laughing through every mental and physical challenge the wall had to give us. The views are so breath-taking no photo can do it justice, the challenge pushed me past my limits and rewarded me in ways I never expected.“I learned so much about the Chinese culture and had the adventure of a letime. I made the most amazing memories and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone , I will cherish every moment for the rest of my le and feel privileged to have been had this experience and to have raised funds and awareness for CLAN at the same time.”CLAN head of income generation and business development Fiona Fernie commented: “We are so grateful to everyone who undertakes challenges to raise money for CLAN.“We never underestimate how hard people work to raise money for CLAN and it is rewarding to hear when our supporters have had really positive experiences doing so. CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : amOfficers from Police Scotland’s cybercrime prevention team will be running an event for parents and carers tonight, to help raise awareness of the most common issues faced by young people online.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial. We must give a voice to our local producers in these trade talks while we still can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

HIAL has also said there are no planned reductions in staff numbers as a result of the project.The union representing staff at the airports, Prospect, says the proposals are #poorly thought-through, have not been consulted on, and will put the long-term future of vital services at risk.The union has said the plans could take £.m of direct employment away from rural and island economies.Further proposals would also see a review of air traffic services at At Benbecula and Wick John O’Groats, with a new system put in place there, which Prospect says would likely result in a further ten redundancies.HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “The strategic programme decisions made by the Board will move us into the implementation phase of the project and allow detailed operational decisions to be made. “The acquisition of a base for the new Combined Surveillance Centre marks a signicant next step in the project.“It will allow us to move forward with planning and procurement of the relevant systems to safely deliver a state of the art air traffic control management system and give additional clarity to colleagues and stakeholders as we deliver this complex and challenging programme.“Our focus continues to be on aviation service delivery and providing a safe, modern and efficient means of handling aircraft for the regions and the islands in the future.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Released in , this epic signature tune from this well-known group of musicians is an all-time classic.Essentially, the lyrics talk about the older generation – most probably mums, dads, teachers and politicians – not understanding the youngsters of that time.Nothing new in that. Each generation takes a swipe at the one that went before. It’s a coming-of-age phenomenon. My personal swipe was listening to The Jam and then belting their tunes out on my guitar. But, as I am one of those old dads now, I look at the current generation below me and ask myself what their fight, argument or beef is with us all. And the answer is not a good one...I have just spent the week in London – alone. Despite London being a city of about nine million people, one can get through a whole day outside of work, not involved in any discourse with anyone.: Young adults are more likely to feel lonely than over s: Teenagers claim social media helps them feel less lonelyA quick coffee and some sour-doughy toast down my neck, shower, listen to LBC and then out the door for business. From the moment I left the flat in Peckham, I was alone. Walking along the Main Street to Peckham Rye tube station, the road was full of folks just like me.I always walk briskly, but not too fast. The old knees are not up to it anymore. But I can keep up with the crowd. And the crowd just chugs along here not as one, but as a bunch of iniduals with no sense of community. Then it gets worse.No eye contact, no chatAs I hit the tube station with that famous London Underground signage, the hustle and bustle really kicks in. It is every man, woman, binary and child for themselves. I beep my Oyster card on the contactless  and I’m in. Locked into the London transport system, where the only conversations one hears involve “rude” people talking loudly on mobile phones.As I stand on the , so many of the commuters seem so young. I look around me and smile at a couple of the girls. Well they look like girls to me, probably the same age as my -something daughters. They look at me quickly then look away. No engagement, just the fear of the unknown Celt who is looking weird and smiling. I’m either a pervert, desperate, weird or worse in their eyes. So, what do they do  They get back to their phones.Travelling on the tube is not any better once ensconced within a hot, stuffy carriage. No eye contact, no chat, no nothing. Ninety per cent of people are staring at technology. I look at them and feel their brains are glued to their gadgets. Someone visiting from another planet may see these digital devices as demi-gods. But, there almost everyone is, immersed in a world far away from the moment they are in.White noiseAnd here is this problem for this generation. The technology is fusing their minds. It seems to own them. If The Who song was written today, it would be about the technology singing about its generation, the sad humans addicted to its messaging.Once above ground again, sitting in Pret-a-Manger at Pimlico, nothing changes. This generation sips coffee while it surfs and gawps at small screens. A growing trend in this new generation is to have earphones or earbuds permanently stuck on their heads. White noise drowning out the tedium of le in the capital.I almost plucked up the courage to chat to a young lady sitting adjacent to me. She was doodling on an A pad while her smart phone lay beside it, flashing up messages from Instagram, WhatsApp and whatever other notications she had switched on. But, in the end, I didn’t bother trying for any conversation. Perhaps her version of people-watching was a digital version and not the kind I enjoy.And so the day goes on in London. There are millions of people existing and interacting with tech. But, underneath it all, I would suggest they are pretty lonely. Not simply alone, as in having no permanent partner, but lonely – a result of the social isolation precipitated by social media, one could argue.It acts as a barricade surrounding people in proper social situations, so they fail to interact with those around them and in near proximity. From what I could see, both the young and the older citizens of London are hooked into this world, like something out of the film The Matrix.Apps to help meet peopleThey are pushing data to big warehouses across the globe that are storing, examining and manipulating it all to keep them wired to screen time, while they fail to see what is in front of them.I got home about pm most nights. I closed the flat door and retreated into my personal space. And so did all my neighbours. Each one decompressing, eating dinner and, yes you guessed it, getting on Apps to meet people. From dating apps looking for Friday night company to hook-up Apps looking for quick sex, along with more slow-burn friendship Apps. And as I looked out my kitchenette window where I could see Canary Wharf about five miles away, with its glass buildings and shining lights, I felt a bit sad, a bit lonely.And I was only there for a week!It makes me wonder why there is so much talk of depression, mental health fragility and anxiety. This generation is ing dferently. It doesn’t feel right to me. But, I do hope it comes to its senses soon. Otherwise the machines will have taken over.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland s attitude to alcohol must change leader comment","story":"Minimum unit pricing of alcohol has resulted in a fall in sales, but more must be done before Scotland, as a nation, stops being a problem drinker.Given that the average person in Scotland buys more than the recommended intake of alcohol on a weekly basis, there really is no denying that this country has a drink problem and that there is a pressing need to do something about it. The most dramatic step taken by the Scottish Government to date has been the introduction of minimum unit pricing for alcohol, a controversial measure but one which was credited with a . per cent fall in shop sales, according to a study published in the BMJ journal.However, while a minimum price is a way of using market forces to improve our nation’s health, it was never going to be the solution all by itself. What is also required is a broad change in attitudes towards alcohol within society. Too many young people still appear to think that getting drunk is a good idea and underage drinking is a serious problem.: Scottish tourist town calls for ‘boozed up teenagers’ to be banned from celebrating Hogmanay: Minimum unit pricing has cut Scots alcohol spendingEven in the Borders town of Melrose, there are no calls for teenagers to be banned from celebrating Hogmanay because their “intimidating” drunken behaviour is so bad that it is putting off tourists.A new study, based on interviews with  youths aged  to  who drink alcohol, found that there had been no impact of minimum pricing on their consumption. While this is a small number of people on which to draw conclusions about behaviour on a national scale, the research, as Alcohol Focus Scotland said, should be “concerning”. “The apparent ease with which these young people are able to acquire alcohol raises serious questions about enforcement of existing licensing legislation and age-verication arrangements which are there to protect young people,” said the group’s Alison Douglas.There are some who will regard any government interference with our drinking habits as an infringement on civil liberties by a ‘nanny state’. As ever, the trick is to find the balance between helping people do what they would probably accept is the right thing and allowing them to make their own decisions. While further state intervention may be required before Scotland learns to drink in a reasonably responsible way, there is a limit to how much politicians can do using legislation and the level of such interference the public will tolerate.However, politicians and other leading figures in society can and should try to bring about a cultural change in how people in Scotland, particularly the young generation, view alcohol.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"reimagined princes street gardens would host 15 major events a year under new business plan","story":"A business plan for the long-awaited Quaich Project would see the redeveloped park used as a catalyst to ldquoreimagine Princes Street and the west end of the city in the next few years.There will be no limit on the number of ticketed events which do not restrict wider access to the gardens in future. The cap only affects concerts and other major events which close off all or part of the park to non ticket-holders during normal opening hours.The business plan, which is due to be discussed by councillors next week, would effectively give the green light for major events like the Summer Sessions pop and rock concerts, the Fly Open Air dance music festival, the cityrsquos festival fireworks finale and the Hogmanay concert in the gardens to continue.The proposed limit on events which restrict public access to the gardens is three times the size of a previous official cap, which has been in place for years. It was effectively relaxed when the council decided to treat an extended series of concerts as one event.The business case also raises the prospect of new medium-sized events being staged in the gardens, such as the ldquoSummer Nights events held in Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow. It is thought there would also be flexibility to accommodate large-scale one-off events involving the likes of the BBC, MTV or the Tour de France.The overall vision for the project, which has been in the planning for five years, is to \"create and sustain a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.\"Income from all-ticket events would help subsidise the staging of smaller-scale events in the gardens, such as a Pride event, cinema screenings, showcases for buskers, school prom events and light shows.Other new events could include theatre productions, traditional arts and culture events, live music performances, spoken word events and family activities. Under the vision for the future of the park, which dates back to the mid-th century, ldquoevery Edinburgh citizen and visitor to the city will have experienced West Princes Street Gardens and the Quaich Project. Community groups would only pay a nominal fee, which could be as low as £, for the use of the gardens for their events under the new financial model, with the city council handling bookings from event organisers and promoters.It is hoped up to £, a year could be generated from the hiring out of the gardens for events and income from the new two-storey ldquogateway centre, although running costs for the new-look gardens are estimated to come to up to £, in future.The Quaich Project, a public private partnership being pursued by the city council and a trust set up by Apex Hotels founder and former Edinburgh Playhouse owner Norman Springford, would see the run-down Ross Bandstand, which opened in , replaced by a ldquoHobbit House-style pavilion for performances and an amphitheatre instead of the existing concrete bowl.A two-storey complex featuring a visitor centre, cafe and corporate hospitality facilities would offer direct access from Princes Street and boast spectacular views of events below Edinburgh Castle. The business plan has been published ahead of detailed designs for the revamp of the park being submitted to the council in the spring. A key aim is to deliver ldquoa balanced programme of activities ranging from small scale community events  learning programmes to festivals and major events throughout the year, befitting a capital city, world class visitor destination and much-loved public lsquogarden.rsquoIt states: ldquoWe will curate the use of spaces and activities throughout West Princes Street Gardens to enable a primary focus on community events which reflect the nature of the spaces involved.\"These include school and family events, lectures and talks, garden and nature tours, traditional art and culture, live music and theatre, heritage and historical programmes. The new facility will be offered at low cost for community groups and schools.ldquoWe will also procure and programme a specic number of major events which will provide high profile and high-income streams to create the affordability to community groups.ldquoWe will promote and market the project to a wide range of community bodies, schools and colleges, event and festival organisers to ensure that a healthy balance exists to enable an active yet tranquil and accessible space across the year.It is hoped that the impact of the Quaich Project will help the west end of the city withstand the impact of the new St James development, which is due to open later this year. Work is also due to be finished within months on a new Johnnie Walker visitor centre in the former House of Fraser department store, while there are plans to turn the former Royal Overseas league building opposite the bandstand into a hotel.The blueprint states: ldquoSitting in the heart of Scotlandrsquos capital, the Quaich Project offers a unique  for promoting a wide iety of activity in a spectacular setting, underpinned by a core aim of providing a mix of events and activities that fulfil our mission.ldquoIt also offers a catalyst for the re-imagining of Princes Street and its environs. With the opening of the new St James Centre and the refocusing of retail activity to the eastern end of the city centre, the project has the potential to drive the context of the area ndash cultural, social, wellbeing and environmental themes dominating a space currently occupied by buses and shops.In his report for next weekrsquos culture committee, place director Paul Lawrence states: ldquoThe completion of the refurbishment and development of West Princes Street Gardens in general, and the redevelopment of the Ross Pavilion and the construction of the associated gateway building in particular, is to the benefit of residents, visitors, event organisers and festivals, and Edinburghrsquos reputation.Donald Wilson, the city councilrsquos culture chief, said: ldquoThis is a very important stage in the project to reimagine West Princes Street Gardens.ldquoThe core focus for the business model is on community access and activity by creating and sustaining a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.ldquoThis is a model where big events that involve exclusive access to the gardens are kept to a minimum, but these will make it possible to offer low cost rental of spaces to community or charitable organisations. Crucially, it proposes no more event days than we have at present.ldquoWest Princes Street Gardens are open almost every day of the year, with early closure for events, mainly in the evenings, amounting to less than % of normal opening times. It is estimated that within the new operating model this would continue.ldquoThe proposed new access route behind the pavilion is estimated to reduce event set up and takedown times by at least  per cent, thus reducing the impact on the gardens.David Ellis, managing director of the Quaich Project, said: ldquoOur vision is to improve the entirety of the gardens with a focus on making them a more enjoyable and accessible place for the benefit of Edinburgh residents and visitors all year round. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"senior labour msp scottish independence referendum should be decided by holyrood","story":"Alex Rowley, the partyrsquos constitution spokesman, said the ldquooption of the [referendum] power sitting in the Scottish Parliament... is worth serious consideration.Currently the power to hold a referendum has to be transferred by a Section  Order from Westminster to Holyrood. It is this order which Boris Johnson has refused to grant despite demands by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon that the general election result gave the SNP a mandate to hold indyref.A former deputy leader of Scottish Labour, Mr Rowley has long been an advocate for \"home rule\" - a position recently touted by his partys leader Richard Leonard - and has now produced a pamphlet discussing his views on independence and a second referendum.: Senior Scots Labour figures come out in favour of independence referendumHe says that Scottish Labour needs to erge from the unionism of the Conservatives and the \"illiberal\" Liberal Democrats, that it is \"the sovereign right of the Scottish people\" to decide the countrys future, but stops short of backing independence.Mr Rowley is the second senior Scottish Labour member to push for a change in the partys policy on a second independence referendum. Shadow health spokeswoman Monica Lennon has also said the \"future of Scotland must be decided by the people of Scotland\".His idea of \"home rule\", he says, would result in further substantial powers being devolved to Holyrood - leaving areas such as macroeconomics, defence and foreign policy in Westminster. The whole issue, he says, should be put to members of the Scottish Labour Party and not decided by a \"small band of MSPs\".Mr Rowley writes: \"There are some within the Scottish Labour group who want us to rule out any referendum for the foreseeable future. This would put us alongside the Tories and illiberal Liberals and would play direct into the hands of Nicola Sturgeon.\"He also says that while he does not believe the Scottish Government has a mandate for another vote, the issue is not one that should be determined by Westminster. \"My own view is that the option of the power sitting in the Scottish Parliament with a requirement of a two-thirds majority to trigger any future referendum is worth serious consideration.\": Euan McColm: Aping the SNP wonrsquot help a Scottish Labour party in declineVotes from  MSPs would be needed to make up two-thirds - meaning pro-union voices would have to be persuaded to supplement the  independence-supporting MSPs from the SNP and Scottish Green Party.However he also claims the First Minister is \"not serious\" about holding another vote this year, a position she has this week stood by despite the Prime Ministers rejection of the powers to hold another referendum.Mr Rowley suggests the SNP was looking to make the  Holyrood election into a vote on Scotlands constitutional future - something he claimed was a \"deliberate deflection tactic\" from the partys record in government.He added: \"We should also be clear that Labour supports the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine their own future and we should not weaken that position by being caught in this  argument about another referendum.\"Right now in Scotland there is no majority demanding a referendum so let us focus on our vision for Scotland.\"Despite Mr Rowleys direct contravention of Labour policy, the partys Scottish leader Richard Leonard welcomed his pamphlet.ldquoScottish Labourrsquos executive has commissioned a review into the general election result and the lessons we can learn from our defeat. Candidates, elected representatives, party members and affiliates are contributing their own views during this period, and I will consider these alongside the shadow cabinet and Scottish Labourrsquos executive,\" he said.ldquoScottish Labour is opposed to the creation of a separate Scottish state, and we are opposed to the SNPrsquos vision for a decade of cuts after independence. We believe that home rule for Scotland within the UK, with more powers not just for the Scottish Parliament but for every workplace and community, offers the greatest opportunity to bring about real economic, social and environmental change.SNP deputy leader Keith Brown accused Labour of attempting to \"block democracy\". He said: \"Labour always seem desperate to create new schemes and wheezes to block Scottish democracy.\"This latest plan is reminiscent of the infamous % rule in  - where Labour conspired to block a Scottish Assembly despite a majority of Scots voting for one.\"While its welcome that figures in Labour are increasingly realising that Scotlands future must be for the Scottish people to decide, they need to ditch this plan to tie Holyroods hands.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow city wide 20mph speed limit approved","story":"The speed limit will be brought in on all residential streets, main shopping areas, and places where there are high levels of walking or cycling.All other streets in the city will generally remain at mph, although the council said final arrangements would be subject to \"careful assessment\".A total of  miles of Glasgows streets are already covered by mph limits , including the city centre since .Glasgow is following the lead of Edinburgh, which became the first in to introduce city-wide mph limits, between  and .It is hoped the scheme, which is estimated to cost £. million, will reduce the risk of crashes, cut noise and congestion, and encourage people to walk and cycle more.Anna Richardson, city convener for sustainability and carbon reduction, said: \"First and foremost, a city-wide mph speed limit is about improving road safety.\"Its well known that lower speeds reduce the risk of accidents but also reduce the severity of any injuries suffered by those involved.\"Our own initial research on the impact of mph zones already in place Glasgow is indicating a  per cent reduction in incidents, which is hugely positive.\":  caught above Edinburghrsquos mph limit in just four hours\"Safer roads will make walking and cycling a much more attractive option for getting around the city.\"Building a greater reliance on more sustainable forms of transport is vitalwe are to achieve our target of Glasgow becoming carbon neutral by .\"Many cities across the country are introducing a widespread mph limit and the evidence thats being gathered shows that the impact on journey times for cars and buses has been minimal.\"The plans were approved by the councils city administration committee following a recommendation by the local authoritys environment, sustainability and carbon reduction policy committee to introduce a mph policy.More than  miles of the citys , miles of roads are considered to be in residential areas. and  miles of city streets already have a mph limit.Proposals for a city-wide mph limit will be subject to statutory traffic regulation order process.If approved, the scheme could be brought in over the next four yearsfunds are available.Motoring group IAM RoadSmart questioned whether casualty numbers would be reduced.Neil Greig, its Scotland-based policy and research director, said: \"For Glasgow council to say this is all about road safety is setting themselves up for a fall.\"The evidence for mph limits reducing death and injury is at best mixed, which is why the Scottish Parliament rejected the idea of a blanket reduction to .\"Simply putting up a few signs and not changing the look and feel of a street will have little impact.BACKGROUND: Insight: The case for mph zones\"The best schemes involve re-engineering the road so it is either dficult to speed or it is clear space is being shared with pedestrians and cyclists.\"This investment would be better spent on targeting those areas with the worst performance in road safety and activity rates by upgrading the urban environment to encourage a sht away from cars.\"But sustainable transport campaigners Transform Scotland said safety would be improved.Director Colin Howden said: \"Were pleased to see Glasgow commit to mph as the default speed limit.\"For decades, street design has prioritised streets for vehicle traffic rather than for people, and its long overdue for this to be reversed.\"The simple fact is mph zones save lives.\"Reducing the speed of a car from mph to mph increases a pedestrianrsquos or cyclistrsquos chance of survival from  per cent to  per cent.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"administration accounts manager with garriocks ","story":"Garriock Bros.

No film-maker has documented UK society as forensically as Ken Loach. The desperation that comes from poverty, the bad choices that often seem like the only choices available, are his stock-in-trade. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another compelling exemplar of what the man is all about.Marriedparents Ricky and Abbie did all the right things. They followed the rules andworked hard and were on the brink of becoming homeowners when the Northern Rockbuilding society collapsed, taking their dreams with it. Now mired in debt, theyare shunted from one shabby rental to another along with surly son Seb andsmart daughter Liza Jane.Ricky’sskills are no longer in demand. Even though he is a “grafter” who has doneevery job under the sun, proper jobs – with set hours, agreeable conditions, anda decent wage – are like hen’s teeth. So he takes a punt, persuades his we tosell her car, and buys a nearly-new van. them. He doesn’t get a wage – he chargesfees. He is a self-employed knight of the road, free to make as much money ashis speed around Newcastle will allow.Theillusion is soon shattered. His boss at the depot is a bullet-headed bruiserwith all the empathy of a shark. That’s because he himself is trapped in jungleof competition with other depots. He may be an apex predator, but he’s only asubstandard quarter away from losing his crown.Thegig economy is sold with promises of self-empowerment and personal agency thereality for Ricky is -hour days, a black box all-seeing eye that has timingsdown to the second, and financial penaltiesa sht is missed # for whateverreason, whether family emergency or personal injury. The god of just-in-timedelivery doesn’t care about any of that. Neither does Ricky’s boss, theself-appointed “patron saint of nasty bastards.”Thereisn’t even enough time to go to the toilet. On his first day with PDF, Ricky ishanded an empty plastic bottle by a co-worker. For male drivers in a hurry, itis an essential piece of equipment.Ricky’smachine-tooled existence is mirrored by his we’s. She is a care worker on azero-hours contract who has only minutes to attend to the basic needs of herelderly charges. One of them, Rosie, used to cook for striking miners in thes. When Abbie tells her that her own working day is from .am to pm,Rosie counters with: “What happened to the eight-hour day ”It is a pivotal scene. Losing what we once took for granted has been a Loach mot for decades. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another powerful chapter in his social history of post-war Britain."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/001WH1701NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 17th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

I want to make sure the Assembly reflects the new opportunity we have and have said to members both publicly and privately that I have to try and set a standard here of respecting everybody no matter who is in that chamber, they are all equal. The people who vote for them are equal. It’s about respect at the end of the day and I have to earn that as well.”The West Belfast MLA said that his take on the dynamics of the new ing Assembly going forward is that “it’s very important that it rises to occasion”. Having met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnston, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Maskey said that both governments need to “respect that as well”. “We’ve got to respect political dference and we have to manage those,” he said. “I had very constructive engagements with them on Monday, obviously the substance of their visits was dealt with by the Executive.”Impartiality in his role as Speaker is a core element of the post, he said.“I had been pushing very hard on securing the funding that was announcement by the Department for Education for West Belfast schools. When it was announced about St John the Baptist I couldn’t even comment on it as I was in the ‘chair’ and that is the type of thing that your constituency needs to see a result on. There are little restrictions in this role but I will try to manage them."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"andytown ahead of schedule","story":"THE new Andersonstown Leisure Centre is set to open to the public in April, it has been revealed.Speaking at the official opening of the Brook Leisure Centre in Twinbrook, Cllr Brian Kingston, Chair of Belfast City Council’s Strategic, Policy and Resources Committee, said the redevelopment project was “ahead of schedule”.He said: “West Belfast has more to look forward to later this year with the opening of the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, scheduled to open in April.“Herron Brotherstold me they are ahead of schedule.“Both Brook and Andersonstown Leisure Centres will completely transform leisure opportunities and active living access in West Belfast.”The new £ million state-of-the-art facility on the Andersonstown Road will focus largely on water-based family fun, with the newly installed water slides having been visible for months.The centre will also offer a range of dry facilities including a -station fitness suite, exercise and spin studio, café, multi-purpose room and two outdoor G five-a-side pitches."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"best of traditional irish music for belfast","story":"THE Waterfront Hall is set to host the  Gradam Ceoil TG music awards, with globally renowned quintet Beoga playing live at the internationally acclaimed event.Trad sensation Beoga, who collaborated with Ed Sheeran for his  chart topping hit ‘Galway Girl’ will take to the stage, for what is set to be the biggest Gradam Ceoil to date.Gradam Ceoil is the premier annual traditional music awards, with this year’s event set to be televised live on TG and available to stream on BBC iPlayer live from Belfast on Sunday February  thanks to support from Northern Ireland Screen’s Irish Language Broadcast Fund.The band are looking forward to their upcoming performance in Belfast.“We are delighted to be involved in the rdannual Gradam Ceoil TG traditional music awards celebration.

The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"nicole starts new year at home","story":"NEWTOWNABBEY woman Nicole Adams has finally been allowed tohome after six weeks in hospital.We’ve been following the journey of cystic fibrosis suferrer Nicolewho last year won her battle for access to le-changing drugs.But Nicole was admitted to hospital at the end of November where her condition deteriorated after she caught a flu.Despite her sickness, she was still keen to start the drugs Symkevi and Orkambi after the Department of Health agreed a deal with US pharmaceutical company Vertex to make them available in the north.Unexpectedly, Nicole’s body reacted badly to Symkevi and she was taken into intensive care on December  as she fought for her le.Brave Nicole battled through and has now been given a more powerful drug – Trikafta – as she continues on the road to recovery.This week, Nicole completed a remarkable turnaround as she ed home with one month’s supply of the new drug.“I have one month’s worth of Trikafta in my grasp and it is so surreal,” explained Nicole.“What it has done for me so far is amazing.

the tour to the Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial in Poland.The Nazis operated extermination and concentration camps in Poland when Germany occupied the country during the Second World War.HE Dr.

 Muslims, including  prominent religious leaders, from some  countries during the “groundbreaking” visit.The AJC delegation included members of the organisation, among them some children of Holocaust survivors.“To be here, among the children of Holocaust survivors and members of the Jewish and Islamic communities, is both a sacred duty and a profound honour,” Mr al-Issa said.“The unconscionable crimes to which we bear witness today are truly crimes against humanity.“That is to say, a violation of us all, an affront to all of God’s children.”HE Dr. #MohammadAlissa and delegates from the

Auschwitz was the most notorious in a system of death and concentration camps that Nazi Germany operated on territory it occupied across Europe.In all, . million people were killed there, most of them Jews from across the continent.The visit comes as Saudi Arabia works to be seen abroad as a moderate and modernising country following decades of adherence to a hard-line interpretation of Islam known as Wahhabism.History in the making: The most senior Islamic figure ever to visit @AuschwitzMuseum, Secretary General of @MWLOrg_en Dr. Al-Issa, begins his visit, accompanied by Muslim leaders from around the world and AJC leadership, to mark  years since the liberation of the Nazi camp. pic fxxJANSE— American Jewish CommitteeJanuary , The Muslim World League, under Mr al-Issa’s leadership, has embraced the effort.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s strategy to modernise the kingdom is aimed in part at attracting greater foreign investment and fostering a national Saudi identity that is not founded solely on conservative religious values.Mr al-Issa’s outreach to Jewish organisations also coincides with a broader alignment of interests and ties emerging between the Arab Gulf states and Israel, which share a common foe in Iran.On Friday, members of the delegation will visit the Polin Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw and attend Muslim and Jewish religious services there."},{"url":null,"title":"510981","story":"The Shantallow Community Centre is to be demolished tomorrow to make way for a new pound. million facility, but before the doors close for the last time

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar.

Lyndon Stephens died that morning after battling stoically against illness. His record label, Quiet Arch, was already planning to go into hiatus due to his illness and had planned a farewell gig in the Belfast Empire for that very evening. As fate would have it, it became his wake. I am a firm believer in the human spirit being how people remember you and I prefer to gather other people’s memories for things like this. Ryan Vail: “The man that gave me a career in music, toured me around the world, put me on tv, put me on radio, made me a headline festival artist, got me sound tracking, got me remixing, got me producing, got me talking on some of the most important industry , got me the most prestigious funding awards my manager, friend, label partnerLyndon Stephens.“I was his very first signing nine years ago and stayed with him the whole time.

He didn’t know me or owe me anything but kept putting me forward to talk to the local press that were at the event. “After the show, he askedI’d like to chat to him about working together. “Over the course of the next five years we broke down so many walls and glass ceilings. We spoke on the phone three for four times a day every day. I could call him at ungodly hours and he always answered, he was always there, Lyndon loved to talk. He was an incredible human being with a wonderful family and friends circle. “I know that when any friend musician needed advice of funding I pointed them towards Lyndon andhe had the time, he gave it willingly. I have an incredible amount of memories. I will miss my old friend so dearly, but in truth, I am truly blessed to have met Lyndon Stephens”.Francesca O’Connor, from Quiet Arch ,said “Lyndon Stephens, a man who wanted to make a genuine dference to this world, give the underdogs a  to shine and to show the world the incredible talent coming out of Northern Ireland. “He set up an artist management company, Champion Sound Music and record label, Quiet Arch, to put Northern Ireland artists on the international stage.

But with our lives being so busy we often forget the simple activities bring the happiest times and memories. As parents, and childminders too, we can also feel under pressure to always be teaching our children, so this week I’ve combined these two themes, baking and learning. The curriculum for our young children talks about three prime areas of learningand these are Personal, Social andEmotional Development - this is all about learning to share, to wait, taking an interest and participating in activities, being responsible for tasks, having opportunity to feel valued and able to contribute, talking about what you are doing together, asking questions and having a special bond etc. googletag.cmd.push Communication and Language - this is about listening, paying attention, being able to focus and concentrate, being able to follow instructions, naming dferent items and actions, speaking in sentences, asking and answering questions, having a two way conversation etc Physical Development - is about small finger movements and large movements too, it’s about being able to use and control items, objects and tools etc and also self care, personal hygiene, having own likes and dislikes, being safe and using equipment safely etc. If we consider these and look at all that baking involves we can see all the learning that is going on from collecting all ingredients, selecting and organising bowls, spoons, whisks etc, washing hands, putting on an apron, then reading instructions, following a receipe, talking about what next, weighing, counting, pouring, breaking, mixing, adding, stirring, smelling, washing implements, waiting for cakes to cook then cool before sharing and tasting! googletag.cmd.push  Recipes For You To Make Together Scones - g oz self raising flour, g oz butter, g oz caster sugar, ml fl oz milk, pinch of salt . Method Heat the oven to C F Gas . Lightly grease a baking sheet. Mix together the flour and salt and rub in the butter. Stir in the sugar and then the milk to make a dough.

In addition their anger has grown on foot of the announcement yesterday that our MLAs will receive pound, increase in their pay with a further increase in April . “NIPSA has no issue with the fact that MLAs, as workers, are receiving a pay increase – however all workers – including civil servants deserve to be treated equally and receive at least an inflationary increase in their pay plus some recognition for the loss of pay over the past  years. This benchmark has now been set. NIPSA is meeting with the Finance Minister later today when we will be pressing him to ensure that civil servants, who it has been acknowledged, have been working in very dficult circumstances in the absence of the NI Assembly, receive an above inflationary pay increase in recognition of the work they have carried out over the last  years without political direction.”Ms Millar went on to say: “We are looking forward to the meeting later today with the Minister and we hope for a positive engagement and a positive outcome in which civil servants can be appropriately rewarded.”People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin said he will be joining workers on the picket line.“Hard working civil servants get no automatic pay increases every year. Theyve had year on year cuts from Stormont. Theyve been lied to and treated with contempt.“The new Stormont deal talks about workers rights but civil servants are still being forced to take strike action for very modest demands.“Let the Stormont Executive parties know they need to start treating workers with respect.”Concluding Coucnillor Harkin said:Solidarity with the strikers and all workers demanding justice, dignity and respect.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We have had a range of concerns over time around recommendations emerging from the Independent Financial Review Panel.We are jointly asking the Assembly Commission that any pay proposal is immediately deferred until the work of the Financial Review Panel has been comprehensively reviewed, and a new  has the opportunity to consider this matter again and produce a fresh determination. We recognise that a number of MLAs and parties have indicatedthe proposed pay increase cannot be halted, they will donate any additional sum to local causes and charities.”Derrys MLAs had al- ready declared they would be donating the money to charityit could not bestopped or ed.The SDLPsMark H Durkan said he understood the public anger after the raise was announced.When I heard about the rise I thought it was ludicrous.I dontfeel I deserve it or am entitled to it.Mr Durkan said he would be donating the money to a charity in the Foyle constituency.His party colleague, Sinead McLaughlin, said she too would give the money to charity.Im only in this job  days so I really dont think I qualy for a raise at all, shecommented.If I get it I will choose a charity to donate it to. googletag.cmd.push UnjustiableSinn Feacutein MLA Raymond McCartney said his partyopposed the increase.“Given that the Assembly has just been restored this increase is unjustiable, he said.“Sinn Feacutein will not accept it.“We are actively exploring options for stopping this pay rise.“If that’s not possible then we will seethis money can be ed to public funds or donated to charity.”The view was echoed by Mr McCartneys party colleague, MLA Karen Mullan, who retweeted joint leader of the Assembly Michelle ONeills statement “given that the Assembly has just been restored this is unjustiable and should not be paid.”DUP MLA Gary Middleton said: As many will know, Assembly member salaries are set by an independent body and are not under the control of MLAs.However, I believe the automatic pay increase which is due to be implemented this year is not acceptable.The announcement will have done nothing for confidence in the Northern Ireland Assembly.I will be looking at mechanisms by which it can be ed andit cant I will be donating it to a charity in the Foyle area. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development. Redeveloping the expansive Irish Street site can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment and will provide a boost for existing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down senior footballers face tough opener  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS senior footballers head for Clonmel on Sunday more in hope than optimism to open their Division  Allianz League campaign against Tipperary.Paddy Tallyrsquos charges face a tough opening game as the Premier County, who were relegated from Division  last season, will be like a wounded animal and determined to bounce back into the leaguersquos second tier.The sides met last June at Pairc Esler when Down won an All-Ireland Qualier - to -. Pat Havern, Corey Quinn and Donal OrsquoHare did most of the scoring that day, but Tipperary will be a dferent proposition at the weekend.New Tipp manager David Power, who famously led the county minors to an All-Ireland title in , has an abundance of talent at his disposal, but he will have to without star player Michael Quinlivan.The Clonmel Commercials man has decided to go travelling for a year and his absence is a huge loss to Tipperaryrsquos attack and the countyrsquos bid to regain their status in the top flight ahead of next seasonrsquos championship changes.Promotion is also a must for Down as well, as they too have huge aspirations of avoiding competing in the All-Ireland second tier competition.Down have just emerged from an indferent McKenna Cup campaign.Wins over Fermanagh and Antrim were cast aside when Tallyrsquos team were given a reality check by Tyrone in the semi-finals.Mickey Hartersquos experimental side simply over-powered Down and had too much physicality all over the park.Hopefully, Down will have learned from that game, but second guessing Tallyrsquos team selection ahead of Sunday is a dficult job.Definitely missing Sundayrsquos game will be vice-captain Caolan Mooney, the one player in the camp who has the ability to stand out from the rest. His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night. Second was st Ballyroney, with st Raffrey finishing third.This is the most prestigious event in the Battalion calendar and a very high standard of drill was set by the locals, who have been practicing the movements for the past four months.Apart from the squad competition, there was also a squad commandant cup presented at Banbridge and Sgt M Cuffey, of Crossgar, was the winner.The overall competition was chaired by Mr D Partridge, Battalion president, assisted by Mr R Dickson, Battalion secretary.

They say they are simply removing mercury out of the rotating lens system and putting in a new ldquoinnovative mechanical bearing solution, insisting that the changes are not being driven by any

Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse continuing to provide an essential safety service for mariners as it has done since a light was first established in Killough in .During a public meeting last year to discuss the proposed changes at the lighthouse, CIL was urged by concerned residents and politicians to leave the lighthouse as it is and not to do anything to harm its heritage.There was also a warning that there would be ldquoructions at all levelsthe proposed changes were implemented, with several people pointing to the potential for the lighthouse to be transformed into a unique leading visitor attraction which would provide an economic boost for the area.Residents opposed to changes argue that Killough boasts the ldquofinest example of a lighthouse of its kind and that no one is in any doubt about the maritime history and heritage of St Johnrsquos Point and its uniqueness.Campaigners say that they are determined to protect the heritage of the lighthouse and suggest it is

potential to generate millions of pounds in tourism revenue.Typical activities in geoparks include the development of walking and cycling trails, training local people to act as guides, the provision of information signs and the development of visitor centres.Northern Irelandrsquos only other current geopark mdash the Marble Arch Caves which inhabits the rugged mountainous uplands and gentle rolling lowlands of counties Cavan and Fermanagh mdash contributes just over poundm to the economy in this area.Local council officials, who confirmed a pre-Christmas Recorder story that the formal bid for geopark status had been submitted, have revealed that an Area of Outstanding Natural Beautymanagement team for the three local areas has been created.Council officials say that they are continuing to work secure geopark status which is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism.But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting.

The downside of that is the sum would be lesser, as tax will have been taken off.The options plan was drawn up after the Assembly Commission, the devolved legislature’s corporate body, determined that it had no legal power to halt the rise, because the responsibility to set MLA pay rested with an independent body.Sinn Fein chief whip John O’Dowd said the independence of the Independent Financial Review Panel was paramount.“The next issue we wanted to answer was how we ensure that MLAs did not profit from the inflationary increase that was awarded by that body and we have put in place a very simple mechanism where the MLAs canthat money,” he said.SDLP chief whip Colin McGrath said the commission was unable to stop the rise being implemented.“That money is going to come to us, that is set in law,” he said.“But the parties have worked hard together today and have now set in stone a process which will enable us to give that money back.”Mr McGrath said a new salary review  was due to be constituted.DUP leader Arlene Foster claims ‘unanimity’ at Stormont on reducing abortion time limits while campaigners debate outcome Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Should that  not make any determinations before the end of this mandate each of the increases that come in on the first of April will move into this scheme, so there will be extra money for charities or extra money for the public purse.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

The firm is marking two decades leading the way in the industry, and according to founder Terry Moore, the firm is well on its way to doubling its size and embracing the latest technology for its clients Outsource Solutions is a firm which is ahead of the curve when it comes to emerging technologies and a company which embeds itself in a client’s business to ensure total integration – ultimately helping to boost it and help it grow.“Our approach is to embed ourselves into the customer’s business, and take IT out of the boardroom,” Terry says. “What we do is try to get ahead of some of the problems, understand the business and recognise that the technology is there to benefit the company.“We are there to make sure that business is possible – enriching lives, making things easier and safer. An important part of this is the relationships that we have.”Terry formed Outsource Solutions  years ago, around the time of the so-called ‘millennium bug’ when he says some firms were using scare tactics to get businesses to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds, often unnecessarily. “For me, one of the things I felt was missing was understanding a business and factoring that refresh into it over a few years – letting them get on with what they do.”The company – which now has five locations, including Belfast – is a full service IT firm which manages every element of a business’s infrastructure, including security, enterprise wi-fi, telecoms and networking.“We now have just over  staff and are we are on a five-year plan to double in size again. There has been considerable growth in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and telecoms,” Terry says.Client retention is also something which Terry and the business prides itself on. “Every customer that we signed up with in , we still work with,” he says. “We will give a recommendation as to how we think a network should be built. If they accept that, then we take it on as a risk.“Technology is just a toolbox for us to allow us to deliver IT – technology to allow them to really access and control their data.”Outsource is a business which has been at the forefront of emerging developments in technology, including cyber-security. Terry says, even just a few years ago, it wasn’t being taken seriously by many businesses. That has now changed signicantly.“In the last couple of years, cyber has completely exploded – but we were ahead of our time,” he says. “My experience of last  years and the last five in particular is that there has been a massive job to do in educating businesses and their users about the cyber threat.“We have reached the tipping point and the human firewall is becoming much stronger – people and users are more sensitive to what it means, making it all a far better place. But there are still businesses which are happy to cut fast and loose, and take risks.”While the company’s client base started off in professional services businesses – such as law and accounting – it’s grown into a host of sectors, including transport, logistics, manufacturing and engineering.“We have carved out a niche in hospitality as well – particularly in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and communication, generally.”Terry says Outsource is seeing business growth among many of Northern Ireland’s medium-sized businesses, with more than  staff.“Our job is to enhance, improve and optimise the performance for as many users as we can. Our aim over the next four years is to be able to deliver those services outside Northern Ireland, across the rest of the UK and into the Republic of Ireland.“For us, the constant is that we are always there at that point of where technology is consumed. The role we play is being integrated and a trusted advisor. That’s how we will continue to be successful.”As for the next  years, with a rise in automation and articial intelligence – something Terry says has to become a little more intelligent and a little less articial – the next major leap will be the advent of quantum computing. It’s something which remains in its infancy.“While it’s still early, we are on the verge of the most aggressive technological change that any of us have ever seen,” he says.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
