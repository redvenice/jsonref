That hurts,’ he said.The Duke added of the Press: ‘Unfortunately, if the source of information is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society.’In an extra clip that did not make the final two-hour cut, Oprah asks Harry if they left the UK because of racism to which he replied: ‘It was a large part of it.’In more additional footage, Meghan said her treatment in the Press had been worse than Kate’s, saying: ‘If a member of his family would comfortably say “we’ve all had to deal with things that are rude”, rude and racist are not the same.’   Royal warfare erupted after Harry and Meghan revealed deeply private and confidential conversations with the royal family to a US journalist friend after they appeared on Oprah, despite claiming it would be their \u0027final word\u0027 on their rift with the royals.The couple told breakfast show host Gayle King the prince had finally spoken to his father and brother - and she went on a major TV network to disclose that the talks ‘were not productive’.Miss King also suggested that Meghan was unhappy that no-one in the Royal Family had picked up the phone to her yet following their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey.And in a thinly-veiled threat, the broadcaster said Meghan had made clear she has ‘documents to back up everything she said on Oprah’s interview’.The fact that the couple chose to discuss such sensitive discussions between senior members of the royal family with a TV journalist, who broadcast them blow-by-blow within hours, met with an icy response from Buckingham Palace. Prince William has insisted that the Royal Family were not racists after Meghan claimed one of them had raised ‘concerns’ about ‘how dark’ her baby’s skin would be, and suggested that they tried to deprive Archie of a title and security because he was of mixed race.She also claimed she had been given so little support by the palace that she suffered suicidal thoughts.For his part, Harry said he felt ‘really let down’ by his father, accused him of cutting him off financially and refusing to take his calls, while revealing there was a gulf between himself and William. In recent days there have been a handful of stories published in the UK reporting that Charles and William felt hurt by what Harry had said, but with very little detail on what was taking place behind the scenes.That was turned on its head when Miss King, who attended Meghan’s lavish baby shower in New York in 2019 and is Miss Winfrey’s closest friend, decided to speak out on her prime time morning show on CBS, the same channel that broadcast the Sussexes’ interview.Harry was accused of ‘embarrassing’ hypocrisy this week for speaking to CBS, which caused outrage in 2004 by showing a photograph of his mother dying in a 1997 car crash in Paris.Miss King told viewers she had called Harry and Meghan at their £10 million California home ‘over the weekend’ to discuss the fall-out from the interview and revealed that they had told her details of their intimate conversations.She said: ‘Well I’m not trying to break news, but I did actually call them to see how they were feeling, and it’s true, Harry has talked to his brother and he has talked to his father too.‘The word I was given was that those conversations were not productive. But they are glad that they have at least started a conversation.’Miss King also claimed that the couple were unhappy that ‘the palace’ had apparently been leaking what they believed were untrue stories to the media, adding: ‘And I think what is still upsetting to them is the palace keep saying they want to work it out privately, but yet, they believe these false stories are coming out that are very disparaging against Meghan, still.’She made clear that the Duchess was unhappy that no-one in the family had called her, despite her making a string of highly inflammatory allegations against several of them in her interview and revealing details of what had been a private conversation between her husband and a family member in which it was alleged an offensive comment had been made.‘No one in the Royal Family has talked to Meghan yet, at this particular time,’ she said.The Sussexes effectively accused the Royal Family and Buckingham Palace of institutional racism in their interview with Miss Winfrey.But Miss King claimed they felt ‘frustrated’ that much of the coverage had focused on this - when they had apparently only wanted to provoke the monarchy into taking action against the media, which they believe has a racist agenda against Meghan.‘I think it’s frustrating for them to see that it’s a racial conversation about the Royal Family when all they wanted all along was for the royals to intervene and tell the Press to stop with the unfair, inaccurate, false stories that definitely have a racial slant,’ Miss King said.‘And until you can acknowledge that, I think it’s going to be hard to move forward. But they both want to move forward with this and they both want healing in this family. At the end of the day, that is Harry’s family.’The broadcaster also raised the investigation launched earlier this month by Buckingham Palace into how claims of bullying against Meghan lodged by a senior member of palace staff were handled.Her former communications secretary, Jason Knauf, complained in 2018 that she had driven out two PAs with her behaviour and was targeting other female members of staff, but nothing was apparently ever done in response to his allegations.Miss King says: ‘The bullying thing was raised in 2018 and now there’s an ongoing investigation about bullying from Meghan Markle, when anyone who has worked with her will tell you exactly who she is. You know, she’s really a very sweet, caring person.’She added: ‘And as I say, Meghan has documents to back up everything that she said on Oprah’s interview. Everything.’In a further discussion about the ongoing family strife and how to resolve it, Miss King seemed to suggest that Harry and Meghan were not satisfied by Buckingham Palace’s response to their bombshell interview and the claims in it.She said: ‘The family has to acknowledge that there are issues. And right now, no-one has acknowledged, “Houston, we have a problem here”. That’s really all they want. They want a conversation. They both want a conversation.’There was no immediate reaction from the Sussexes’s team of PR people - either in London or California - about whether Miss King was speaking at their request.But as one of their closest friends and media allies in the US, it is unthinkable, say insiders, that they would not have at least been aware that she may choose to brief it.Royals aides appeared to be genuinely horrified that either the duke or duchess would personally choose to tell anyone, let alone a television journalist, about intimate and highly confidential conversations that Harry was having with his closest family.They fail to see how it will go any way towards repairing their damaged relationships or rebuilding the family’s shattered trust - on either side.One said: ‘The only positive we can take out of this is that at least they are talking. It would be better from now on, however, if that could be done in private space.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Key witness George Floyd trial car refuses testify","story":"Share this articleWitness Who Was in George Floyd¿s Car, Maurice Lester Hall, Says His Friend Did Not Resist Arrest - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Hermes pays retailers compensation computer glitch marked parcels undelivered","story":"Share this article One worker claimed they were underpaid for 1,114 parcels over eight weeks, missing out on almost £400 worth of commission.Another independent store said they were owed for 300 parcels across a six-week period.Natalie Lightfoot of Londis Solo Convenience in Glasgow said: \u0027Last week, myHermes only paid me for one parcel when I know I had processed double figures.\u0027When I see this, it makes me wonder if it has ever been right.\u0027And Atul Sodha, owner of Peverills Londis Harefield in Uxbridge, said he has since been refunded for 342 missing parcels.\u0027The worrying thing is I didn\u0027t even know I was owed this,\u0027 he said.\u0027I\u0027ll be keeping a much more watchful eye on the parcels coming into and out of my store from now on.\u0027Meanwhile, Hardik Patel, owner of Svarn News \u0026amp Off Licence in Stafford told Better Retailing he was owed payment for hundreds of missed parcels across a six-week period.He said: \u0027Last week, I was underpaid by 74 parcels.

There is even a 38-stop route des fromages through the region, with road signs featuring cheese wheels directing drivers to 38 dairies and farm producers that make some of the country’s finest cheeses. Among the area’s most recognised contributions to French fromage are its blue cheeses of these, probably the best known to people in the UK is Saint Agur. This rich, tangy cheese is made in Beauzac, located beside the Loire in the Haute-Loire department, south-central France. It’s a “pretty, medieval village”, says Saint Agur’s fromagerie director Ludovic d’Eysmond, who describes a picturesque scene, where a church and ramparts “create a beautiful square in the centre of the village”. All of its milk comes from within 45 miles of the village, largely from farms in nearby hamlets, nestled on the side of the dormant volcanoes that are characteristic of the area’s terrain. Milk is provided by Montbéliarde cows, a breed prized among French cheesemakers because the protein levels of their milk produce higher yields of cheese than milk from other cows. They graze outside every other day, weather permitting. The heritage of Auvergne’s blue cheese dates back to the mid-1850s, when a local cheesemaker noticed the tastiness of the blue mould that would sometimes appear on his cheese curds. After experimenting, he realised that if he injected the mould, it would cause veining throughout the cheese. All of the area’s cheeses have characteristics that make them stand out inidually. Saint Agur is prized for the way it balances tangy notes with creamy, almost mushroom-like richness, whereas others are known for flavours that range from grassy notes that are almost woodlandy, through to borderline spiciness in some of the more powerfully moulded offerings. But one thing many of Auvergne’s better cheeses have in common is that they are ripened in some form of underground caves Saint Agur, for instance, spends 10 weeks in Beauzac caves. The rocks that create those special flavour-maturing conditions are largely volcanic, created by the dormant giants now covered in pasture that the cows graze upon.

Another area where fungi, particularly moulds, are important is in the production of popular foods. Soy sauce, fermented meats and cheeses are just some of the foods that owe their existence to mould. But it is in cheese, especially blue cheese, that mould plays its most recognised and, arguably, delicious role. The origins of blue cheese are vague, but the story goes that, in the seventh century, a shepherd in the southern French village of Roquefort (literally meaning “strong rock”) left his lunch of bread and sheep’s cheese in a cave when distracted by a local girl he saw in the distance. Many months later, the same shepherd apparently stumbled on his abandoned meal only to find it contaminated with Penicillium roqueforti, a mould that grew within the cave’s soil. It is not clear why the shepherd decided to consume his rediscovered meal, but since then Penicillium roqueforti has become a mould typically used in many blue cheese varieties, especially Saint Agur. The origins of blue cheese may be a myth, but the science of how Penicillium roqueforti is responsible for the flavour of Saint Agur and all other blue cheeses is just as fascinating as any legend. What is mould? As with other fungi, mould is found in natural environments that are damp and rich in nutrients (forest soil, wood and, of course, caves). Moulds are decomposers, which means they break down organic materials that other species, such as invertebrates, struggle to digest. In doing so, they release into the soil soluble nutrients that plants and trees use to grow. Unlike plants, mould does not reproduce through seeds but rather spores, the dusty stuff that appears on top of mould, which floats through the air when released and begins to germinate when the microscopic particles land in hospitable environments. The spores then produce interwoven, thread-like structures known as hyphae, which become what are called mycelium when massed together. Mycelia are considered single organisms, but they can stretch underground for considerable distances. In fact, recent research has shown that the mycelia of some fungi form symbiotic relationships with plant and tree roots, resulting in underground networks where the host plants can exchange nutrients, water and information. These networks are called mycorrhizae and are often likened to the internet and have been called the “wood wide web”. Their existence is forcing the scientific world to rethink their understanding of plants more generally. Penicillium roqueforti is part of the same genus (Penicillium) as the key mould species used in many modern antibiotics. First identified by the Scottish bacteriologist Sir Alexander Fleming as a potential agent in the fight against infection in 1928, it took another 10 years for a team of scientists at the University of Oxford to develop the world’s first antibiotic compounds from moulds such as Penicillium chrysogenum (sometimes known as Penicillium notatum) and Penicillium rubens. The mould itself does not kill bacteria but produces penicillin as a natural product, which attacks the cell walls of a wide range of bacteria. So what does this have to do with cheese?To create blue cheese, there are a variety of methods used by cheesemakers for different cheese types. Some still rely on mother nature and simply age their cheese in clement environments where the mould will naturally infect the wheels. Saint Agur, for instance, matures for 10 weeks in caves to allow for the mould to grow and give Saint Agur its unique taste and texture. Most manufactures, however, introduce powdered Penicillium roqueforti cultures to the cheese milk before the milk is coagulated and the curd is separated from the whey. Once the cheese has been moulded into shape, it is left to mature. It is at this point, in the early stages of the maturing process, that stainless steel rods are forced into the cheese to permit exchange between oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide produced by the mould in the cheese’s interior. This encourages the growth of mould and gives rise to the characteristic blue-green veins that run through this type of cheese. It is the presence of the mould and the enzymes it produces that are responsible for the colour, flavour and texture of the cheese. The mould raises the acidity (pH level) of the cheese, which changes its texture and flavour, while also breaking down proteins in the cheese to give it a softer, creamier consistency. The moulds also have a strong lipolytic action that breaks down fats, producing fatty acids, known as ketones, that give the cheese its rich flavour and powerful aroma. So next time you reach for some Saint Agur, remember that the mould has put a lot of work into making it the ideal companion for your crackers.

Kluge said falling infections among the over-80s in Europe showed the impact of vaccination on the spread of the virus, while data from the UK’s campaign suggested vaccines had so far “saved, at the very least, over 6,000 lives among people over 70”. “Let me be clear: we must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock, now,” Kluge said, urging all governments to share excess shots. The WHO said 27 European countries were in partial or full nationwide lockdown, with 21 imposing night-time curfews. “As long as vaccine coverage remains low, we need to apply the same public health and social measures as we have in the past,” Kluge said. “Now is not the time to relax.” Underscoring the apparrent lack of vaccine urgency in some countries, Spain’s Madrid region stopped administering shots at health centres for four days so medical staff could rest over Easter, despite pleas from the national government to continue. The health minister, Carolina Darias, said last week it was “very important” to keep vaccinating over the break to make up for earlier delays due to supply shortages, but Madrid authorities said more shots had been given earlier in the week to compensate. Spain’s 16 other regions were reported to be administering vaccines as normal. In Germany, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier became the first high-profile German official to receive a dose of the AstraZeneca jab as politicians joined an effort to shore up confidence in the troubled Anglo-Swedish vaccine. Steinmeier, 65, received his shot at Berlin’s military hospital under new guidelines restricting the vaccine’s use for the under-60s. “I trust the vaccines authorised in Germany,” he said. “Vaccinating is the decisive step out of the pandemic.” Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the guidelines on Tuesday after Germany’s vaccine regulator reported 31 cases of AstraZeneca recipients developing cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a rare blood-clotting disorder. Health minister Jens Spahn, 40, had appealed to politicians over 60 to show their faith in the shot. People under the age of 60 can still take it in consultation with their doctor and providing they have been made fully aware of the potential risks. Several other countries, including France, Spain and Canada, have also imposed age restrictions on the vaccine. The European Medicines Agency has said experts reviewing links with the rare reports of clotting have found no specific risk factors, but are continuing their investigation. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced an acceleration of France’s vaccination programme to make shots available to all over-50s by mid-May as he unveiled new Covid restrictions on Wednesday, stopping short of a strict lockdown. Schools will close for three weeks, non-essential shops will shut and people are restricted to travelling within 10km of their homes, with travel over the Easter weekend tolerated for those seeking to escape to second homes or rental properties but family gatherings discouraged. The prime minister, Jean Castex, on Thursday defended the measures, aimed at slowing the spread of the virus without shutting the country down entirely, as “consistent and pragmatic” after the opposition Les Républicains party described the country’s health situation as a “catastrophic stalemate”. Castex also said alcoholic drinks would be banned in parks and other outdoor public spaces, adding that police would be quick to disperse groups of more than six people after French media broadcast images of carousing crowds on riverbanks and squares in cities including Paris and Lyon. Italy extended restrictions closing restaurants, shops and museums over Easter until the end of April, but added that “an easing of measures” could be announced if the trend of the pandemic and the country’s vaccination rollout warranted it. The decree, approved late on Wednesday by the prime minister Mario Draghi’s government, made vaccines compulsory for healthcare workers, with those refusing to be vaccinated liable to be reassigned away from the public or have pay suspended.

A small portion of those bills, 55, are advancing through state legislatures, meaning lawmakers have taken some sort of action on them.  About half of those measures deal with new restrictions to voting by mail, which Americans used in record numbers in 2020. Eight deal with new voter ID requirements, while others deal with blocking same-day registration and putting new voter registration hurdles in place. The new tally highlights measures in Arizona and New Hampshire, which it says have the highest number of restricting bills that are advancing.  A suite of bills in Arizona would impose new hurdles to voting by mail, making it easier for lawmakers to remove people from a permanent early voting list and requiring additional information on mail-in ballots. Another measure would prohibit voter registration drives off of government property.  New Hampshire also has 10 advancing restrictive measures, including efforts to make it harder for college students to vote and to place new hurdles for same-day registration.  Ross said she and Floyd used opioids on and off during their relationship, and she noted she suspected Floyd had started taking pills again shortly before he was killed. Senior CNN legal analyst Laura Coates said such questioning was necessary in order to “address bad facts and then demonstrate why they’re irrelevant” to the murder charges that Chauvin faces. “Get up and get in the (police) car. You can’t win man,” he said to Floyd. Floyd responds that he cannot get up. MacMillian, in highly emotional testimony, said he appealed to Floyd to cooperate with the police because he was worried about his condition as he was pleading that he could not breathe. “I was trying to help him,” he said. MacMillian broke down and wept in court as he was shown video of his interaction with Floyd. Courteney Ross, the partner of Floyd, has now taken the witness stand. Ross started crying as she recounted the story of meeting Floyd in 2017. Yesterday, the court heard from the cashier who served Floyd immediately before his death. The young man, Christopher Martin, expressed guilt over his role in Floyd’s arrest. The former presidential nominee made her position known on a newly released episode of “Just Something About Her,” a podcast hosted by Jennifer Palmieri, who served as a senior adviser on Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “The filibuster stands in the way of a lot of legislation and whether or not it can be either reformed and amended or eliminated is what we will find out in next weeks,” Clinton told Palmieri.  She added, “It certainly should be lifted for constitutional matters, and I would put election law matters at the top of that list.”  Many Democrats have called on Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer to eliminate the filibuster, thus allowing bills to pass the upper chamber with 51 votes, rather than the 60 required with the filibuster in place. But currently, Schumer does not have the votes to eliminate the filibuster, as at least two of his caucus members -- Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona -- have signaled opposition to the idea. It’s rare a federal lawmaker makes a complete about-face on an issue with major legislative consequences. But for Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota, the need to shift her position on one of the most crucial issues facing the Biden administration – reform of the filibuster rule – has become too strong to ignore. She now believes that without reform, the filibuster – a rule by which the minority party in the Senate can block legislation – will do serious “damage” to American democracy, she told the . Smith’s move is crucial. Behind the loud voices of the Senate Democratic caucus calling to either dramatically scale back or gut entirely a tool used to obstruct legislation, there’s a usually quieter set of senators, like Smith, who are finally speaking out. In an interview with the , Smith argued that contrary to how the filibuster is portrayed by its advocates – as a tool to make the minority heard – it simply gives a minority of lawmakers outsized power. “I often thought that it’s important that the minority view is heard in the Senate, and that there should be an opportunity for people to come together across lines of difference to get things done. But that wasn’t happening either,” Smith said. “The filibuster wasn’t encouraging compromise. The filibuster was making it easy for any member of the Senate to say no. And the more I looked at that, the more I looked at the damage it was doing to our democracy.” Smith said: “Well, I think that decisions about what we need to do, and how we need to change the rules – if we need to change the rules – are decisions that need to happen in their own way. But it happens in a particular place and time. So I’ve come to the conclusion that I would vote to get rid of the filibuster hook, line and sinker.” “I’m not going to give up on earning Republican support for this because we know that Republicans and Democrats across America believe that this is a good idea,” Buttigieg told MSNBC this morning. The former Democratic presidential candidate said he has had many meetings with lawmakers of both parties, and he noted Joe Biden has encouraged Republicans to offer ideas on the proposal. But Buttigieg was tight-lipped when pressed on which specific members of Congress he has been talking to about the infrastructure package. “Bottom line is, we’ve got to get this done,” Buttigieg said. “The American people can’t wait for good infrastructure.” The transportation secretary will be attending Biden’s cabinet meeting at the White House later today.The news comes days after Dr Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ominously warned that she had a sense of “impending doom” watching the numbers increase. “We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are, and so much reason for hope. But right now I’m scared.” Joe Biden has expressed similar concerns and asked state and local leaders to maintain or reinstate mask mandates to limit the spread of the virus. But many governors have ignored those warnings, instead deciding to move forward with relaxing restrictions. Joe Biden’s massive infrastructure bill will prioritize broadband expansion as a top goal, earmarking $100bn to bring affordable internet to “all Americans” by 2029. After Covid-19 forced many Americans to work and attend school from home, the disparities between Americans with and without reliable access to internet have become more visible, the Biden administration said, citing “a stark digital ide”. “The last year made painfully clear the cost of these disparities, particularly for students who struggled to connect while learning remotely, compounding learning loss and social isolation for those students,” the administration wrote. Joe Biden will hold his first full cabinet meeting at the White House today, a day after introducing his $2tn trillion infrastructure plan. Delivering a speech on the plan yesterday in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the president described his infrastructure proposal as “a once-in-a generation investment in America”. “It’s not a plan that tinkers around the edges,” Biden said. “Is it big? Yes. Is it bold? Yes. And we can get it done.” The White House has said the infrastructure plan will be a focus of today’s cabinet meeting, as Biden’s senior advisers prepare to pitch the proposal alongside him. But it remains unclear whether the plan can get through Congress, where Democrats hold narrow majorities in the House and the Senate. Biden said yesterday that he hoped to work with Republicans to get the legislation passed, but many of them have already expressed opposition to the idea of rolling back Trump-era tax cuts to help pay for the plan. “The isions of the moment shouldn’t stop us from doing the right thing for the future,” the president said in Pittsburgh. “We’ll have a good-faith negotiation with any Republican who wants to help get this done. But we have to get it done.” The blog will have more updates and analysis of the cabinet meeting coming up, so stay tuned.

The Corsair study includes responses from 53,880 participants across the UK, with about 2,000 participants in each of the 37 stages of the study conducted between 2 March 2020 and 27 January 2021. Some participants took part in more than one stage of the survey. The team said lower adherence to self-isolation was associated with factors including being a key worker, having children at home, being male, of a younger age, and experiencing greater financial hardship. Experts said the differences between the ONS and Corsair studies could have a number of explanations, including that the ONS study was based on responses of those within the test-and-trace system. “You can expect that the subset of people who have Covid and who also request a test and provide their details are more compliant than the overall population who have Covid,” said Prof Susan Michie, a co-author of the study who is a participant in the behavioural science subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and a member of the Independent Sage group of experts. By contrast, the Corsair study is based on sampling of the general population by an anonymous online market research company, something Michie said may also reduce concerns among respondents of saying they had broken the rules, compared with being phoned by the ONS, part of a government department. “The good news is that rates of adherence have been improving,” said James Rubin, an author on the paper and a professor of psychology of emerging health risks at King’s College London. But there is more work to be done, he said. “We need to get more people to engage with the system, to recognise the symptoms, to get a test, and then to self-isolate and follow it through,” Rubin said. “We need to be getting people into the mindset of as soon as you’ve got one of these symptoms coming on, get a test. Don’t leave it a few days. Don’t wait until it resolves. “What we don’t want is people who have got Covid out in the community, having contact with other people, spreading the infection. The more people with positive tests who self-isolate, the quicker we can get out of the restrictions we are currently in.”  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Since last May, NHS test and trace has contacted 3.2 million people who tested positive, and another 6.4 million of their contacts. Behind these numbers are countless lives saved and the latest ONS statistics show that when people are asked to self-isolate, the overwhelming majority do so. “It is vital that people continue to do their bit by isolating when they are asked to. As the prevalence of coronavirus falls, our testing-and-tracing system becomes more important in identifying and suppressing local outbreaks while also responding rapidly to the threat of new variants.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Variability of Irish weather continues to pose late blight risks"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4526142.1617273135!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"age based vaccine system should help speed up rollout who special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAny country that had supplies of vaccine should be in a “huge rush” to get them used, the World Health Organisation’s special envoy on Covid-19, Dr David Nabarro has said. File photograph: iStockIreland’s new age-based Covid-19 vaccine system should help speed up the rollout, the World Health Organisation’s special envoy on Covid-19, Dr David Nabarro has said.The Government is coming under increasing pressure following its decision to change the national vaccination programme to an age-based system rather than one also focused on profession.While he did not like commenting on national policy and had not spoken with the Irish Government, Dr Nabarro, said that the revised system made sense to him as a public health representative as he did not like to see vaccines “sitting around in stores,” he would prefer to see it in people’s arms where it could save livesAny country that had supplies of vaccine should be in a “huge rush” to get them used, he told Newstalk Radio.“You don’t want to be sitting on it. You don’t want to have a slow roll out so that is why I am going to say to everybody, do what you can to get the vaccines out. I am also saying, make sure you share the vaccines across all the countries where they are needed – but that is really difficult to say at the moment in Europe, people are really, really keen to get vaccines for their own populations.”Global viewPeople in the developed world should take a more global view of vaccine distribution and take it upon themselves to ensure supplies were evenly shared globally, he urged. Personally, he thought that was the right way to do things.“If our leaders were actually saying that they want to deal with this as a global problem, the majority of people would accept that. I don’t think we are programmed to view our own nations and the humans in our nation as somehow more deserving than the humans in a nation on the same longitude but several thousand kilometres to the south.“I want those who are world citizens to stand up and be counted and tell their politicians this is a world problem that needs a world solution and let’s all be part of that.”Elsewhere Irish-born microbiologist Professor James McInerney has said that using an age based vaccination scheme is “slightly better” than one based on occupation and it is also faster.“Ultimately it is a decision for each country or territory.Crucial timeProf McInerney added that this was a crucial time throughout Europe where Covid case numbers were rising. Countries like France, Germany, Italy and the Ukraine were experiencing “real problems,” he said.Right now was the time to look at inidual activity as the B117 variant could almost be described as a completely different virus given it is so virulent and transmissible, he said. The “old lockdown” measures which had worked last year to reduce numbers would not work as well this time and it would be very hard to drive down numbers.There was a 50 percent higher possibility of hospitalisation because of B117 and double the possibility of ending up in ICU, he warned.“I hear calls for an ease to restrictions everywhere,” he said. “This is a crucial time right now.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar was last night forced to defend the change after Fine Gael TD John Paul Phelan said the Government had “scrapped the list” of people who expected to be vaccinated sooner, such as teachers and gardaí. While Mr Varadkar said the list of workers and professions had never been fully defined, he also said there should have been greater consultation with unions and stakeholders.Minister for Education Norma Foley told the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party the rationale for changing the vaccine priority list must be explained.Apart from teachers, gardaí are also deeply unhappy about the changes.The leadership of the Garda Representative Association is to consider the issue at a meeting on Thursday.The  has learned that the changes to the strategy were discussed last week by a powerful group of officials.

Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 225,684 had received their second dose.Some 184,252 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 326,536 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 274,195 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp21,269 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 500 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4526320.1617287653!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"former gaa player among those facing transplant delays","story":"A former GAA player is urging the public to become organ donors as those waiting for transplants face more delays than ever before due to the Covid-19 pandemic.John Egan, a former intercounty Westmeath footballer, is due to start dialysis in the coming weeks and is also in the process of being added to the kidney transplant list.Egan, from Athlone, works as a senior IT recruitment consultant. More than 15 years ago, he was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy, which causes long-term kidney damage and eventual kidney failure.For the first few years after his diagnosis, Egan was able to manage the condition with steroids and medication.However, by 2018, Egan’s kidney function had dropped to below 30 per cent.At the age of 28, Egan decided to retire from playing GAA. He still works in the management side of the sport.Egan is now in end-stage kidney failure with a kidney function of about 9 per cent.“I was supposed to go through tests to officially get on the transplant list mid last year. Each one of them was put off by a few months,” he says.“I was told at the beginning of last year I would be on the transplant list by October or November, but at this point in time I am still not officially on the list.”However, last week, Egan was in Tallaght Hospital to begin the process of starting dialysis.He will get surgery to implant a catheter into his stomach to allow him to start peritoneal dialysis which he can do at home.He will also meet the surgeon and transplant team in Beaumont Hospital next week, to discuss being added to the transplant list.Egan added that the delays are not the doctors’ fault, and that they are trying to protect everyone from Covid-19.Organ donor cardThe former GAA star was also due to marry his fiancée, Traci, in December of last year. Covid-19 has put their plans on hold.He was hoping that he would have started dialysis, found a donor, and had a successful transplant in time for the wedding, now scheduled for December 2021.“However, this looks highly unlikely due to delays in being officially accepted on the transplant waiting list and the impact of Covid on the number of transplants being performed.”Egan says this is why it is vital that more people become organ donors.“I would support an opt-out system for organ donation, and I would encourage people to sign up for an organ donation card now.“If nobody is having the conversation about organ donation, it doesn’t cross people’s minds until they are affected by it personally.”This week is Organ Donor Awareness Week, which is organised by the Irish Kidney Association.Between 550-600 people are on waiting lists for organ transplants in Ireland, including heart, lung, liver, kidney and pancreas.Organ Donor Cards can be obtained by phoning the Irish Kidney Association on 01 6205306, or by free texting the word DONOR to 50050.People can also visit the website ika.ieget-a-donor-card or download a free digital organ donor card app to their phone."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4525509.1617228405!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"all employees set to have right to disconnect from work from today","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Tánaiste Leo Varadkar is also to invite submissions on his plans to put the right of employees to seek remote working into law.

It says “any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question”.Mr Varadkar said: “The code of practice comes into effect immediately and applies to all types of employment, whether you are working remotely or not.

File photograph: PAThe British government’s latest guidance on flying of the union flag in England, Scotland and Wales has prompted unionist politicians to call for the standard to be flown year round on government buildings in Northern Ireland.Unionists also have linked the flags issue to the Northern Ireland protocol. This has led to an Irish Sea border and the disruption of trade from Britain to the North.On Wednesday the British government called on all local councils to fly the union flag on civic buildings as a sign of British national identity. This was part of an initiative to promote the union of Britain and Northern Ireland.The guidance, however, does not apply to Northern Ireland where the union flag flies over government buildings on about 20 designated days annually.At the end of 2012 and through 2013 Northern Ireland and Belfast in particular was subjected to serious loyalist violence, protests and business disruption after Belfast City Council voted that the flag should fly over city hall on the designated days and not all-year round.DUP Lagan Valley MP Jeffrey Donaldson said on Thursday that flying the ensign 365 days a year over British government buildings should be extended to Northern Ireland.“Many will see it as bizarre that the UK government is only deciding in 2021 to fly the union flag, the flag of our nation, on all government buildings every day. When I visit other nations around the world, flying the national flag on government buildings is commonplace,” he said.Mr Donaldson added that if the British government “wanted to immediately improve the union they would start with the removal of the protocol”.The Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) party also called for the flag to fly every day over government buildings.Meanwhile unionists, as they had threatened, launched a legal action aimed at scrapping the protocol. They also started a crowdfunding appeal to help pay for the actionwhich is being taken by a coalition of pro-union politicians such as DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster, former Ulster Unionist first minister David (Lord) Trimble and former Labour MP Kate (Baroness) Hoey.Ms Foster said the DUP would work with other unionists to send a “united message to our government and to free Northern Ireland from the protocol. We cannot allow our United Kingdom to be ripped apart and our UK internal market to be ided in order to protect the single market of the EU.”Lord Trimble said he joined in the action “because Northern Ireland’s place as an integral part of the United Kingdom is at stake.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsSolidarity with The Silenced.Justice for the Cabra Road One.The Sinn Féin leader was “Brollied” in the Dáil on Wednesday and her colleagues were disgusted.Cut off in full flow for the second time in a row by the Phantom Microphone Muffler of the Lower House. Her ordeal mirrored the treatment meted out to Joe Brolly on RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live show a couple of weeks ago when the outspoken GAA pundit was cancelled mid-interview because of remarks he made about the DUP.A few days later and Mary Lou was similarly disconnected, mid-sentence, from the Convention Centre’s PA system. In her case it wasn’t a content issue but rather because she was banging on for too long.But she let it pass, as did her supporters, which was surprising.Fast forward to this week’s Leaders’ Questions and the Dublin Central TD is silenced yet again as she engages with the Taoiseach.An outrageous thing to do.Or maybe an outrageously brave thing to do.It’s a plucky man or woman who decides to mute the formidable Sinn Féin leader when she’s up on her feet and holding forth. It goes against the commonly held belief that it is humanly impossible for anyone to stop Mary Lou from making her point if that is what she wants to do. Furthermore, a person or persons responsible for turning off her mic risk incurring the wrath of her ardent supporters, who take a very dim view of people slighting their leader.The latest outrage happened when the Ceann Comhairle indicated that her speaking time had expired. She had been questioning Micheál Martin on the Department of Health’s practice of gathering information on children with autism who are involved in legal actions against the State.TDs routinely ignore the first intervention. Deputy McDonald ploughed on. So Seán Ó Fearghail called time again. Leaders routinely ignore the second intervention.“Time is up deputy, please” insisted the Chair. Mary Lou kept on talking but there was no sound, so she had to admit defeat. “Thank you for shutting off my microphone” she sniffed, reluctantly resuming her seat.“I didn’t turn off your microphone, or anyone else’s,” shrugged the Ceann Comhairle.The Taoiseach responded. He too ran over. Ó Fearghail harried him, but Micheál Martin was also impervious to his pleadings. Once, twice, three times he was told to finish up, but to no avail.Sinn Féin’s Padraig Mac Lochlainn was seething at the injustice of the situation. He interrupted with a point of order. How come the Taoiseach is allowed speak for “about 30 or 40 seconds” over time when his party leader (and other speakers) are unceremoniously silenced “for the second week in a row?”Micheál was still talking as the Ceann Comhairle was barking at Sinn Féin’s Whip to sit down and mind his own business and Mac Lochlainn was noisily insisting on urgent clarification from the Chair.“Why are microphones being turned off when the Taoiseach’s microphone remains on? Why are microphones being turned off?”The Ceann Comhairle urged him not to bring the House into “disrepute” but Padraig had the bit between his teeth.“I asked WHO turned off the microphones?”Ó’Feargháil, who likes to keep an orderly house, resembled a tortured barman calling time over and over again, imprisoned for all eternity in a disorderly closing-time loop.He leapt to his feet, growing more annoyed by the second.“I’ll tell you what, in more than five years occupying this chair, I have never turned off anybody’s microphone” he bellowed, jowls a quiver. “I have asked people to abide by the time limits, which are generally ignored. Will you not ignore me and please resume your seat. You’re out of order. YOU’RE OUT OF ORDER!”Padraig relented. “Fair enough,” sez he. “Will whoever is turning off the microphones please stop doing it?”There has to be a better way to enforce good time keeping. Ushers using long shepherd’s crooks or Vaudeville hooks to yank long-winded TDs off the stage would be entertaining.Or maybe the Ceann Comhairle’s first warning could trigger a Dáil “Countdown Clock” with windbag TDs disappearing through the floor to the countdown sound of “du-du du-du de-de-de-de Boom!”Moving onBut with no useful props, all Sean Ó Feargháil could do was declare the debate at an end and plot a course for calmer waters. “We are moving on to Deputy Kelly.”That would be Labour leader Alan Kelly, normally expected at this point in the proceedings to be clutching a grenade and pulling the pin out with his teeth.But the pandemic has turned him disgracefully co-operative and mellow.He began by wishing the Taoiseach well with his new Covid strategy. “The country needs you to deliver and we will play a constructive role in whatever way we can and we will criticise where necessary …. I hope and pray that you deliver.”But a good outcome depends on Micheál getting the plan right because “you’ve put all your eggs in the basket of the vaccine basket”. As you do.Alan Kelly was anxious to dig into the Government’s data for a large number of reasons, one of which is very close to his heart.“My wedding anniversary is in July,” he announced, all of a sudden.“I’m going to offer to take my wife out for dinner in a restaurant she chooses,” he proudly puffed. What a guy. Imagine that, he’s even letting her pick the establishment. The missus will be thrilled.“But I don’t know if I’m actually going to be able to take her out in July to a restaurant because I don’t know if they’ll be open.”The Taoiseach struggled to keep a straight face.Lucky Mrs K. Counting down the days, now that Himself has let the cat out of the bag.Either that or when AK47 makes his big “offer” she’ll shoot him straight down for coming out with such schmaltzy twaddle in the Dáil.Even though the Ceann Comhairle called time on Kelly a number of times the phantom microphone muffler left his microphone unmolested. The Taoiseach wasn’t so lucky.In what is a very rare occurrence in the Dáil, the final words of Micheál’s detailed reply on the vaccination plan went unheard as he was also “Brollied” by the unseen hand at the audio desk.He didn’t appear too put out, even though taoisigh are usually given more latitude because of their lofty status.A comforting thought for Mary Lou. There will be no cutting off of the Sinn Féin leader’s microphone when she becomes taoiseach. Opposition rivals might not be so blessed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4523374.1617053574!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"post brexit focus should be on building relationships not border poll says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told Senators Government could get Northern Ireland protocol ‘back on an even keel’. File photograph: Alan Betson Northern Ireland institutions are “just about hanging on” after a “bruising number of years” and the focus must be on building relationships rather than on a border poll, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Mr Coveney also told the Seanad that “we can move away from threats of legal action” after the UK’s unilateral move to extend the grace period for post-Brexit checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain until October 1st.During a debate on Brexit he told Senators,“we can get back to partnership through a specialised committee and joint committee” and can get the Northern Ireland protocol “back on an even keel”.He also said it was an opportunity for “more pragmatism and flexibility from the European Commission as well”.The Minister admitted that “I’ve become some sort of a bogey man” over the protocol but “the irony is” that his office more than any other “has been constantly talking to the European Commission about need to for pragmatism and compromise”.In an impassioned contribution he said the narrative “now is that it is being foisted on Northern Ireland by the EU and Irish Government and it’s not”.The protocol “was designed as much in London as it was in Brussels, which people seem to conveniently forget”, he pointed out.It is a solution “that isn’t perfect but is certainly the best way of mitigating the disruption on the island of Ireland”.He warned that a collapse in the protocol would result in two “very unpalatable choices” for Ireland.To protect Ireland’s place in the EU market, the State would have to put some kind of border infrastructure in place, which would be politically impossible “or we would be taken out of the EU market by default”.United IrelandSpeaking about calls for a border poll on a united Ireland, Mr Coveney said the focus had to be on building relationships first because the Northern Ireland institutions are not functioning as they should. They are “just about hanging on” after a “bruising number of years”.He said that “perhaps the most challenging element of Brexit” was in how to rebuild relationships “that have undoubtedly been damaged.“Good things happen in Northern Ireland when the British and Irish governments work together,” he added.Earlier Fianna Fáil Senator Niall Blaney said there is no border in the Irish Sea and “we should knock that every chance we get”. He said “it is an imaginary border”.The Donegal Senator said unionists are in an awkward position and “we don’t need to do anything that ramps that up but rather the opposite”.He said those calling for a North-South poll needed to be reminded “of how the Good Friday Agreement was won”.He said a similar sentiment is needed now “this country coming together as one isn’t necessarily about territory but is more about people”.He said of Fianna Fáil’s relationship with Sinn Féin that “we sometimes rub each other up the wrong way” but everyone had work to do for a border poll “down the road” and Sinn Féin needed to put more emphasis on building relationships with unionists.

Photograph: The Taoiseach Micheál Martin has called for a “reset” of the relationship between the EU and the UK to resolve issues stemming from the Northern Ireland Protocol.The Taoiseach lamented the deterioration of diplomatic relations between the bloc and the UK following rows over Brexit and the supply of Covid-19 vaccines.The Northern Ireland Protocol, designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland post-Brexit, has caused unrest among both unionists and loyalists, who have called for it to be scrapped.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Martin said he has told the EU the bloc’s relationship must be “constructive”.He said: “I think we need to reset the relationship.“I’ve made it very clear to our European Union partners that the British-Irish relationship is a unique one, historically rooted.‘Joint custodians’“We’re both joint custodians of the (Good Friday) Agreement and nothing can come between us in respect of making sure that we work constructively together.“That’s our aim and our objective as a Government – to maintain a constructive relationship with Britain.”The Taoiseach said he has argued that “the only future has to be a constructive UK-EU relationship”.The relationship, already damaged by Brexit, deteriorated further due to the EU’s brief suspension of the Northern Ireland Protocol in a row over vaccines.The UK also suspended elements of the protocol unilaterally, by suspending customs checks on goods travelling between Britain and Northern Ireland, a move dubbed “silly” by the Taoiseach.The premier said the EU has already done a lot to “facilitate the uniqueness” of the protocol, but acknowledged there is “work to be done... to see what we can fine-tune”.TackleHe called for the use of special committees to tackle difficulties arising from the protocol, which have been provided for under the Withdrawal Agreement.He said: “We’ve got to try to work those committees to see, can we deal with those issues and make life as easy as possible for businesses.”Despite these setbacks, the Taoiseach believes the relationship can get back on track.“I think it makes sense for Britain that it really works on its relationship with the EU. The EU is ready to engage,” he said.He told the paper that UK officials have been more constructive in recent weeks.The move towards a “win-win” deal on the supply of Covid-19 vaccines across Europe and the UK is a “very important” sign, he added. –PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4526365.1617290303!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mozambique government terminates south african military company s contract","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA temporary settlement centre for refugees from the unrest  in Palma, Cabo Delgado Province, Northern Mozambique. Photograph: Grant Lee NeuenburgEPAWFPA South African military company hailed for saving hundreds of civilians last week during an attack by Islamist militants on a strategic town in northern Mozambique has reportedly had its government contract terminated.The Dyck Advisory Group (DAG), which has repeatedly flown helicopter missions to warn-torn Cabo Delgado province over the last year in support of Mozambique’s army, will shortly end its involvement in the conflict, according to Max Dyck, a DAG executive.Mr Dyck told South African newspaper the Daily Maverick that government officials had decided not to renew DAG’s contract, which comes to an end on April 6th, despite the crucial role its helicopters played in opposing the militants, who are known as Al-Shabaab –“the youth” – in Cabo Delgado.As well as rescuing over 220 local Palma residents and foreign contractors who found themselves trapped by the insurgent’s surprise offensive on the coastal town last Wednesday, DAG’s six helicopters repeatedly engaged the militants in the days that followed to keep them at bay.Several survivors of the Al-Shabaab attack, including South Africans, have publicly said they owed their lives to the DAG teams who came to their rescue, after an estimated 150 militants attacked the town from different directions, killing dozens and forcing thousands to flee.“Our contract will not be extended,” Mr Dyck told the online publication. “Of course, if we had been requested to stay, we would have,” he said.Mr Dyck said the Mozambican government had not given the company a reason for its decision.However, last month Amnesty International accused DAG pilots of indiscriminately shooting and bombing civilians in the province from the air while pursuing insurgents.Mozambique’s government has relied on private military contractors to help it fight the jihadists to date, despite numerous offers of assistance by foreign governments over the past two years.Reached safetyOn Wednesday the United Nations said more than 8,100 people from Palma, which had 75,000 inhabitants prior to Al-Shabaab’s attack, had reached safety since the fighting began in the town nine days ago.Thousands more are still making their way south from Palma by boat or on foot through the bush to the port town of Pemba, Cabo Delgado’s provincial capital, where aid agencies have established camps to receive the refugees, said the UN.Local television in the southern African country has recently been showing images of Mozambican troops being deployed to Palma, and although the town is said to be nearly deserted, the army has confirmed its troops are still involved in skirmishes with pockets of jihadists.Palma is less than 10km away from a multi-billion euro liquid natural gas development led by French energy giant Total, which says it has halted work at its construction site until peace is restored to the area.Al-Shabaab, which claims to be linked to the Islamic State terror group, has wreaked havoc in Cabo Delgado since it started its insurgency in 2017. More than 2,600 people, mostly civilians, have died in the conflict so far and around 700,000 have been internally displaced, according to the UN.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4523761.1617082881!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ten eu states to halt extraditions to uk following brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe European Arrest Warrant was introduced in 2004 and obliges member states to arrest and transfer suspects to countries where they were wanted.Ten EU member states have said they will no longer extradite their nationals to the UK following Brexit, the British Home Office has said.Countries including France, Germany and Poland have informed the UK of their refusal to allow the extradition of their nationals.Two more — Austria and the Czech Republic — will only hand over suspects to the UK with their consent.The European Arrest Warrant was introduced in 2004 and obliged member states to arrest and transfer suspects to countries where they were wanted.The letter, sent from the Home Office to the House of Lords EU committee dates from earlier this month and was first reported by The Times.It said: “I can confirm a total of 10 EU Member States have notified of their intention to exercise an absolute bar on the extradition of own nationals.

There is still a risk you could spread coronavirus, even after you have been vaccinated, they said.It follows research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which found that nearly half of all older people who were vaccinated against Covid in England were breaking lockdown rules.Researchers found that compliance with coronavirus restrictions started to wane after the initial injection, with 41 per cent of respondents reporting that they had broken the rules by meeting up with someone indoors.UK lockdown restrictions made it illegal to meet socially with family or friends unless they are part of a person\u0027s household or support bubble.Janet Lord, the director of Birmingham University\u0027s Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, said people should not hug their children even if they had been vaccinated because relaxing social distancing could offset the benefits of the vaccination programme.I would certainly advise not to do that at the moment because as you probably know with the vaccines they take several weeks before they are maximally effective, she said. It\u0027s really important that people stay on their guard even if they\u0027ve had that first vaccination.A Cabinet Office spokesman confirmed that it was working on updating assets for step two of the Government\u0027s roadmap, which this week saw the return of the rule of six or outdoor meetings of two households, and a shift from Stay Home to Stay Local.The new message would be regularly put out on official communication channels, including Gov.uk and during national press conferences.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

(Princess Margaret) closed her eyes and ran away - she couldn\u0027t stand what she saw before her, he added.The transfer of the royal mummies has topped lists of Egyptian internet searches logged by Google this week, but not always for positive reasons.Khaled al-Anany, the Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, promised that the parade, to be broadcast live on television, would be “a unique world-class grand event that befits the grandeur of our great ancestors”.But morbid jokes and rumours have also spread on social media that the “curse of the pharaohs”, may be responsible for a series of bad events in Egypt. That includes the crisis in the Suez Canal - which was blocked for nearly a week by the container ship Ever Given - as well as a fatal train crash in Sohag province that killed nearly 20, several fires and the collapse of an apartment building in Cairo that killed 18.  Many have been quoting an ancient warning found on Tutankhamun\u0027s tomb: “Death will come on quick wings for those who disturb the king’s peace.But experts were at pains to dispel any notion of a link between the mummies\u0027 parade and recent events.You know that everyone loves a story like this, said Salima Ikram, professor of Egyptology at the American University in Cairo.

Now the EU’s top leaders are warming towards the Russian-made jab, in a propaganda coup for Vladimir Putin.On Tuesday, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel joined with Putin to discuss “cooperation” over the use and manufacture of the Sputnik jab. Has the EU just sacrificed any remaining vestige of moral authority, in the face of vaccine desperation?The UK now has falling Covid deaths, falling hospitalisations and rapid vaccine rollout – with 45 per cent of our population inoculated, covering almost all those in vulnerable age groups. The EU is, meanwhile, enduring a destructive third wave, across a continent where little more than one in 10 have received jabs.The EU’s joint vaccine procurement scheme was meant to demonstrate power and unity, exemplifying why the “European project” exists. But it has been a fiasco, resulting in unnecessary loss of life, with the vast majority of older and medically vulnerable citizens still unvaccinated. EU leaders have lashed out, blaming everyone but themselves, often acting irrationally. Now, amid much harsh rhetoric and finger-pointing, the bloc appears to be turning to Moscow for help – in a sharp reversal of previous statements and actions.Russia is subject to EU sanctions for annexing Crimea, with some Kremlin officials also under international restrictions for the poisoning and jailing of opposition activist Alexei Navalny. Just weeks ago, Merkel branded his treatment “far from any rule of law standards”, demanding Navalny’s immediate release. Back in November, when Hungarian leader Viktor Orban opted to use the Sputnik vaccine, he was criticised by Brussels. Other EU members, including Slovakia and the Czech Republic, have since done the same, not waiting for the EU regulator before buying and approving Sputnik.While the Russian vaccine has yet to be licensed by the European Medicines Agency, the AstraZeneca jab has. Yet this “British vaccine” has been endlessly criticised by Macron and Merkel on utterly unsubstantiated safety grounds, even as Brussels-based Eurocrats aggressively accuse the UK of blocking EU access to the vaccine.After repeated smears, the EU public no longer trusts the AstraZeneca jab. That’s left the likes of Germany and France sitting on millions of doses they are unable to administer.Brussels insists the bloc doesn’t need Sputnik to hit its target of dosing 70 per cent of the adult population by autumn. Ahead of tough negotiations with Moscow, they would say that wouldn’t they? And given how Merkel, Macron and others are now junking fundamental political and human rights concerns in a bid to speed up inoculation rates, they appear to need the Russian vaccine very much indeed.For EU enthusiasts this side of the Channel, this latest news amounts, perhaps, to a fourth stage of grief. First, they’ve had to admit post-Brexit Britain was right to opt out of the EU’s ridiculously bureaucratic vaccine programme. They’ve then watched the EU fail dismally, with many member states now choosing self-procurement – not just in Eastern Europe, but Denmark and Austria too. Thirdly, Brussels has damaged its economic reputation, imposing export bans amid ongoing threats to requisition privately owned pharmaceutical factories, while trashing a perfectly safe vaccine, offered at cost price, by a world-class British company.And now, the EU could do a deal with Moscow, breaking a united Western front. Yes, Sputnik may well be safe and effective. Health issues are the priority and the EU badly needs faster vaccination. But negotiating with Russia from its current, desperate position, while sitting on millions of AstraZeneca jabs, discredited in a deeply irresponsible post-Brexit propaganda exercise, is a tragic situation for the EU to have put itself in and bad for the West as a whole.The signatories of the 1957 Treaty of Rome sought to “lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe”. With the Continent ravaged by war twice over the previous half-century, this was clearly a noble intention. But consider how Brussels treated Greece during the 2011 eurozone crisis, how it imposed swingeing austerity programmes on nations like Portugal and Ireland to bail out German bankers? Consider how the Eurocrats have sought to reverse countless referendums over the years, including in the UK.Consider how the EU is still – still – trying to destabilise the Good Friday Agreement, fanning the flames of sectarian violence by doggedly insisting on ridiculously invasive and legalistic physical border checks between Northern Ireland and the British mainland, where technological solutions would clearly suffice, in a last-ditch attempt to keep the UK within the EU’s legal orbit.And consider how the EU has handled this pandemic, the greatest challenge to statecraft since the Second World War.

However, the Danish government in March announced a controversial scheme to cut the number of minority-ethnic people in housing estates such as Taastrupgaard.I am very happy to live here and I cannot see myself living anywhere else, says Ms Taidi, a 25-year-old student, as she makes her way up the stairs out of the estate.I cannot see what\u0027s going be better if \u0027we\u0027 are not here, and if 70 per cent of Danish people move here.The estate, which sits between Copenhagen and Roskilde, has been put on Denmark\u0027s \u0027ghetto-list\u0027 of troubled areas every year since the controversial category was created in 2010.The long strip of prefabricated 1970s concrete barracks, sandwiched between a railway depot and a busy road, is no beauty spot. But it only qualifies as a ghetto because a high proportion of residents have a low level of education, that there\u0027s a low average income, and more than 50 percent of residents are \u0027non-Western immigrants\u0027.Denmark\u0027s government - led by the anti-immigration Social Democrat party - now aims to reduce the number of non-Western residents in housing areas across the country to 30 per cent or less within ten years.The plan is to deny them the right to public housing in some areas, while forcing private landlords to rent to them in other, predominantly ethnic Danish, areas.The proposal calls for the replacement of the \u0027ghetto\u0027 category, which it describes as stigmatising, with the terms transformation area and parallel society.According to Esat Senturk, a politician at the local Taastrup municipality, who grew up on the estate, the area has never suffered serious crime or social problems.It was a wonderful place because Taastrupgaard has a special culture, he says. Where I live now doesn\u0027t have the same sense of neighbourliness. People really looked out for one another in Taastrupgaard. I miss it.The housing ministry defended the use of the \u0027non-Western\u0027 category, telling the  it has been used by Statistics Denmark since 2002 to describe first, second and third-generation immigrants from countries outside the EUEEA, UK, Canada, US, Australia and New Zealand.The non-western tenants criterion is used because the earlier initiatives targeting vulnerable areas suggested that a high concentration of non-western tenants is a challenge to the transformation of social housing estates into mixed resident communities, since it can pose an integration issue in addition to the socio-economic issues, it said in a statement.But for Mr Senturk the focus on ethnicity, in reality, reflects what he calls immigrant-bashing in Danish politics, which over the past ten years has spread from the populist Danish People\u0027s Party to the mainstream parties of both Left and Right.As soon as someone wants more votes, they just shout \u0027religion\u0027 or \u0027ethnicity\u0027. They\u0027re cheap points to chase, instead of solving the real problems, he said.The ghetto plan policies of recent years have if anything led to a downward spiral at the estate, he argues.It just frightens people so people don\u0027t dare come and live here, and that makes the people even more isolated. It means that people don\u0027t feel they\u0027re part of Danish society, because they feel that they should quite simply be got rid of.The people in Taastrupgaard and the municipality have worked year after year to lift the estate out of the ghetto list, with detailed plans made in 2016, and then in 2018, only to see the criteria change so that it falls back, he complains.A few blocks away from the flat where Mr Senturk grew up, bulldozers are busy flattening the ground where a succession of the barrack blocks have been demolished, part of a plan to move the local school from the edge to the centre of the estate.Before this plan is even half complete, the Social Democrats\u0027 new policy will mean the municipality has to come up with a new one.I\u0027m really worried about it, first and foremost, about where people can find places to live, Mr Senturk says. If people are going to be forced to move from here, where are they going to go, and how can you force people to live here, people who have a bad view of Taastrupgaard?Even if the 30 per cent target is met, he isn\u0027t sure it will help.Getting more ethnic Danes into Taaastrupsgaard won\u0027t solve the problem, because the problem isn\u0027t ethnicity.Ms Taidi says the plan just makes her feel a little more conscious that even though she has spent her whole life in Denmark, she will always be viewed as an immigrant.We\u0027re used to it, but I think it\u0027s a bad thing, because we\u0027re all people. We shouldn\u0027t put ourselves in categories with \u0027Western\u0027 people here and \u0027non-Western\u0027 people there.I feel I\u0027m Danish because I\u0027m born and raised here.  It\u0027s not like I need a passport to prove that.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"leaving lockdown las vegas booming","story":"This first appeared in the Letter from the USA newsletter. Sign up for expert insight and exclusive analysis on American politics, written every Thursday here.I passed through Las Vegas this week. If I hadn’t known there was a pandemic going on I might not have guessed.The Strip was packed with partying Spring Breakers and stretch limos delivering revellers.Every lounger at the hotel pool was taken, and the pool itself looked like one giant potential Covid bath. It was full of American holiday-makers splashing around with abandon, not a mask in sight.This was probably what Rochelle Walensky, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meant when she warned of “impending doom this week.The only signs of coronavirus restrictions were inside the casinos where (most) people were wearing masks. And (some) gambling tables had plexiglass around them.Most people opted for the tables with no plexiglass. Virus be damned they wanted to see the roulette table clearly as they gambled the $1,400 stimulus payments Joe Biden\u0027s government just gave them.The Las Vegas approach on leaving lockdown could not be more starkly different from Britain\u0027s. And it makes you realise one of them must be getting it very wrong - but which?Recent Covid figures for Las Vegas and London are not dissimilar. Las Vegas has a fraction of London\u0027s population, so is faring worse, and in theory should be opening up later.However, over two weeks ago, Steve Sisolak, the Democrat governor, allowed the casino hotels to increase operating capacity from 35 per cent to 50 per cent. The floodgates have opened.While nobody in Britain can go to the pub, in Las Vegas they just occasionally wipe down the counter at the indoor bar.In the UK you can\u0027t meet with more than six people outside. But in Las Vegas you can stand with a hundred strangers watching a fountain display.That being said, Las Vegas is not a cavalier outlier in the US. Texas has declared itself 100 per cent open - even doing away with the need to wear masks.And Florida is booming, attracting businesses and people, after its Republican governor Ron DeSantis battled relentlessly against pandemic closures.Mr DeSantis\u0027s latest crusade is against proposals for Covid vaccine passports, which he has declared completely unacceptable.He plans to use emergency powers to stop the idea, and then will try to pass a law permanently banning them in his state.The Florida governor is now so popular among Republicans he is second favourite, behind Donald Trump, for the presidential nomination in 2024. And he\u0027s catching up fast.Parts of America like these, that have prioritised their economies during the pandemic, and quickly eased restrictions, will be the ones that emerge quickest and strongest, getting a jump on everyone else.America\u0027s massive internal tourist industry is now flowing to Las Vegas and Florida, as opposed to California where restrictions have been tighter.It remains to be seen whether it results in the virus surging again.But many of the American tourists pouring into Las Vegas, packed like sardines on fully booked cheap flights, are acting like the pandemic is already history.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ludicrousness policing lockdown shows time put safety public","story":"Never mind vaccine passports, if the government really wants the police to enforce its latest round of Covid rules it will have to issue us with bits of paper providing information on our living arrangements: where we live and with whom we live – preferably with photographs of all fellow members of our household.How else is a police officer, delving into the morass of people out enjoying themselves after months of being banned from any kind of socialising, supposed to pull people over for breaking the ‘rule of six’? He could spot a group of seven around a barbecue and go over to ask a few questions, but he can’t automatically assume they are breaking the law because there is an exception for large families – who can meet in groups of more than six providing that no more than two households are involved. But then how to establish how this group of seven breaks down into separate households?At least in full-scale lockdown the rules are relatively clear. True, there has never been a clear definition in England of how far we have been allowed to travel for our daily exercise – with the result that a pair of women were fined (later rescinded) for travelling five miles to take a walk near an uncrowded Derbyshire reservoir, while the Prime Minister insisted he was within the rule travelling seven miles for a cycle ride in the Olympic Park. But it is when the rules start to be relaxed that it gets really confusing. That’s when we end up having to ask ourselves whether a sausage roll constitutes a ‘substantial meal’, whether our Christmas dinner is a business meeting and so on.There is an alternative to the silliness: rather than try to impose silly, unenforceable rules which leave us all scratching our heads as to how we are supposed to comply, why not trust us to judge what is safe and what is not? Instinctive authoritarians will gasp at that suggestion, and think we can’t possibly function as a society without panels of experts to lay down the law on what is and what isn’t safe.Yet throughout the Covid crisis the public has led the government on tackling the disease, not the other way around. In March 2020, while government advisers were still talking about life going on pretty much as normal while we gained herd immunity, people started making their own minds up and severely restricting their movements.We can see that in the data for transport use. By Friday 20 March – still three days before the Prime Minister announced lockdown – rail travel was already down to 43 per cent and tube travel already down to 24 per cent of normal levels. The following Monday it fell to 25 per cent and 15 per cent, with the result that when the Prime Minister addressed the nation that evening there wasn’t much left to lock down – the public had already locked themselves down.Similarly, when infections reached very low levels last June, it was the public which decided it was safe to go out and enjoy themselves again, even in large groups in parks and on the beach. It was a classic case of the wisdom of crowds: while ministers huffed and puffed about irresponsible beach-goers, government epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse later told MPs that not a single outbreak of Covid anywhere in the world had been traced to a beach.    Give us the information, yes. Tell us what the scientists know about how the disease is spread, what our risks are of catching it, and suffering serious consequences if we do catch it. But rather than try to turn that into petty and unenforceable rules, why not trust us for a change to decide how to process that information? In the process, the police could be freed to concentrate on what they really should be doing, but in many cases aren’t: arresting the shysters who have taken advantage of Covid to commit record levels of online fraud.     It is clear from what you see and hear of people around you that the public has decided, like it did last June, that the crisis, for now, has receded. People see the figures for new cases and deaths, they see the data on the efficacy of vaccination, and they have adjusted their behaviour accordingly.

Speaking at a BQ in Middlesbrough, Mr Johnson said: Thereaposs definitely going to be a world in which international travel will use vaccine passports.

The National Living Wage - the Tories’ name for the minimum wage for over-s - has risen by p an hour to £.. And because - and -year-olds are included in the top rate for the first time, they have got a boost of p an hour. The legal minimum is also hitting £. for those aged - £. for those aged - £. for  and -year-olds and £. for apprentices. Boris Johnson hailed the rise for million workers on a trip to BQ in Middlesbrough, saying: “Itaposs the fastest growth in incomes for people on low wages for  years or so.Thataposs very important, part of the levelling-up agenda, building back better, helping families through what has unquestionably been a tough time. But workers on full furlough will get no more money this month than they did last month - despite the boost to the minimum wage, and a host of other household bills going up. That is because furlough is a fixed sum, based on up to % of what you actually earned in the final month before either March  or October  last year. It does not take into account what you would have earnedyou were, in theory, back to work this month. Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds MP said: “This is no April Fool - the Chancellor really has decided to hit the lowest paid furloughed workers with a pay freeze in the middle of a pandemic.“That’s on top of his real-terms pay cuts for our NHS Covid heroes, his massive hike in council tax for families across the country and his plans to slash Universal Credit in just a few months.“Hitting Britain’s families in their pockets isn’t just wrong - it’s economically illiterate. “If families have less money to spend, then businesses will suffer and the recovery will take longer.”  Some .million jobs were furloughed at the end of February as lockdowns continued across the UK. Under the scheme, the government pays up to % of wages or £, a month, whichever is lower. But this % is calculated based on a “reference period” of actual earnings earlier in the pandemic. That reference period is mostly the final month’s pay before March , . For some workers it is October . Workers who joined a payroll between October ,  and March ,  will be able to join the furlough scheme from May , until it ends in September. The reference period for those claims hasn’t been announced yet.

Jenny Harries, Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer and chief executive of the new UK Health Security Agency , said there was learning to be had on testing, masks and asymptomatic transmission of coronavirus. It is a far cry from her claim a year ago that Britain had been an international exemplar in preparedness. She said in April : The fact that there is a pandemic stockpile is considered a very high quality mark of a prepared country in international terms. Challenged on her claim today, Dr Harries did not retract it - instead saying: My comments there were based on the fact that the WHO, the EU and many other inidual countries actually use our teams to train in their countries to advise on pandemic preparedness. And she insisted: I think we share some of those failings with many other countries.  Dr Jenny Harries said more testing would have been carried outtests were available earlier on, and knowledge about asymptomatic transmission could have resulted in a prompt recommendation to wear masks. Speaking at the launch of the new UK Health Security Agency , of which she is chief executive, Dr Harries told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: We were not fully prepared for this pandemic and, as Iaposve said, Iaposm very happy to accept there is an awful lot to learn. I think we share some of those failings with many other countries. Askedthe initial response to the pandemic was poor, she said: I think it had merits and it had things that we would wish to improve. She said that while asymptomatic transmission had been considered carefully, the proportion of cases - now thought to be % - was not recognised.  So obviously the response that we put in place and some of the interventions were not accounting for that high degree of numbers of asymptomatic cases, so I think thereaposs learning as weaposve gone through. Asked about face coverings indoors, which were not initially recommended, she said: Weaposve learned more, as Iaposve said, about asymptomatic transmission, and I think we would recommend face coverings earlier. Dr Harries said the issue around testing was that more tests were needed early on. Public Health Englandhas been heavily criticised over a decision to stop community testing and contact tracing last March after it became clear the virus was spreading at a fast pace.

Boris Johnson is preparing to unveil plans for the resumption of foreign travel.A task force led by the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is looking at the possibility of re-opening international travel, with a report said to be handed to the Prime Minister in the coming days. Reports say that on Monday he is expected to announce plans for ato travel abroad using a apostraffic lightapos style system. This would reportedly see travel to aposredapos countries banned, holidays to aposamberapos nations needing a negative test and quarantine, with aposgreenapos countries giving some form of exemption but with testing. Now, the Dailyreports that only about a dozen destinations could be categorised as aposgreenapos and therefore safe to travel under Covid restrictions by June. The paper claims that Malta, Gibraltar, Portugal, Israel, Canada, Barbados, the UAE and the US could all be put into the lowest category because of their plans to vaccinate half the adult population by mid-May. Three other popular destinations, Spain, Greece and Turkey, would reportedly be on the amber list, which includes quarantine measures. It is likely that huge popular holiday destinations in France and Italy will be off limits, as both countries battle spiralling Covid cases and deaths amid a third wave.

The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said the UK is no longer a country where the “system is deliberately rigged” against ethnic minorities. But No was criticised for a “basic own goal” after the report was released late to selected journalists with strict orders not to seek reaction. The Boris Johnson-ordered review suggested the UK should be a “model” for other countries because of its success in improving equality. But the report, commissioned after the Black Lives Matter anti-racism protests last summer, was accused of “glorying” the slave trade. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section The -page review suggested ­children should be taught the “slave period” was “not only about profit and suffering” but “how culturally African people transformed themselves”. Race relations think-tank the Runnymede Trust said it felt “deeply let down” by the findings. Director Halima Begum said: “All this is a whitewash and a script that has been written to  Downing Street.” Commission chairman Dr Tony Sewell claimed some communities are “haunted” by historic racism which led to a “deep mistrust” and could be holding them back. Yesterday’s report criticised “bleak” thinking among some anti-racist campaigners who seek to blame all disparities on white discrimination. It claimed that white prejudice is “dwindling” and those campaigners “ert attention” from other reasons for minority success and failure. Dr Sewell claimed while racism is a “real force” in Britain, particularly online, there is no proof that institutional racism exists. He said: “Disparities do exist, they are ied, and ironically very few are directly to do with racism. Too often ‘racism’ is the catch-all explanation.” The study concluded factors other than race – including family, geography and deprivation – had a bigger impact on le chances. “No one denies and no one is saying racism doesn’t exist,” he said. “We found anecdotal evidence of this. However, evidence of actual ­institutional racism  No, that wasn’t there, we didn’t find that.” Critics questioned the ­suitability of Dr Sewell and No policy chief Munira Mirza, who set up the commission, who have previously questioned the existence of ­institutional racism. Labour MP David Lammy accused the report of “gaslighting” – that is manipulating black Brits into questioning their thoughts or experiences. He said it is an “insult to anybody and everybody across this country who experiences institutional racism”. Runnymede’s Dr Begum said: ­“Institutionally, we are still racist, and for a Government-appointed ­com­­mission to look into [institutional] racism, to deny its ­existence is deeply, deeply worrying.” She added: “I’m absolutely flabbergasted to see the slave trade apparently redefined as ‘the Caribbean Experience’, as though it’s something Thomas Cook should be selling – a one-way shackled cruise to purgatory.” Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary Marsha de Cordova said: “To downplay institutional racism in a pandemic where black, Asian and ethnic minority people have died disproportionately and are twice as likely to be unemployed is an insult.” GMB national secretary Rehana Azam said: “Only this Government could produce a report on race in the st century that gaslights BAME people and communities. It’s immoral.” Prof Kehinde Andrews, a professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, said the report is not a “genuine effort” to understand racism. He said: “It’s complete nonsense. It goes in the face of all existing evidence. This is a PR move to pretend the problem doesn’t exist.” The TUC’s Frances O’Grady said it had “chosen to deny” experiences of minority ethnic and black workers who are far more likely to be in ­low-paid, insecure work. NHS Providers said there is “clear and unmistakable” evidence that NHS ethnic minority staff have worse ­experiences than white colleagues. The report found pupils from ethnic communities did as well or better than white children. Black Caribbean pupils were the only group to do less well.

You can’t tackle institutional racismyou don’t believe it exists. What you end up doing is producing a document that echoes the ‘Nothing to see here’ denial of Boris Johnson’s government. The only surprise is that anyone is surprised. The only response is to continue providing the clear, statistical and anecdotal evidence to undermine the fantasy, delusion, and confused thinking. The report is particularly dangerous because it will embolden those who want to tell black and Asian people to “get over it” when they try to highlight the real disadvantages they face in modern Britain. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section The report’s dismissal of the concept of unconscious bias will also make the lives of those trying to bring about cultural change in the workplace a misery. The report authors did a round of TV and radio interviews attempting to justy their thinking. They succeeded only in showing themselves to be frighteningly detached from reality. Rejecting last summer’s call for the school curriculum to include a more accurate depiction of the British Empire, the report pointed to “a new story about the Caribbean experience,” where slavery was “not only being about profit and suffering”. Er, excuse me  Bear in mind, too, the way that the -page report was released by the government - piecemeal. Cheerleading highlights on Tuesday to selected print media and the rest the following day with the headlines already dominated by the  narrative. Mercully, however, that narrative is at odds with what many people - black and white - have had their eyes opened to over the past  months. Bear in mind too, that the analysis is tainted by the Independent Commission’s preconceived notions that institutional racism is not a thing. Munira Mirza - who oversaw the appointment of the commission - and chair Tony Sewell have previous for dismissing it three years ago.  The trouble is, their opinions fail the black women four to five times more likely to die in childbirth than their white counterparts - as shown in Channel ’s Dispatches documentary on Tuesday night. Also the government statistics from November which showed black people are nine times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people – with  percent of searches never actually resulting in a formal charge. What about the Home Office figures which reveal you are six times more likely to be subjected to “use of force” by policeyou are black  Or the fact that exclusion rates for black Caribbean students in English schools are six times higher than their white peers in some local authorities   Or the news last month that there are zero black or Asian men on the board of the publicly-funded BBC, in breach of its own rules on ersity  Or the revelation last summer that nine major sporting bodies in this country had just one black board member between them  For goodness’ sake, they are publishing this report while a pandemic is wiping out more Black and Asian people across the UK than any other demographic.

He told the Daily : My instinct is that, as the vaccine is rolled out, as the number of hospital admissions and deaths go down, there will be a British sense that we donapost actually want to go down this road. I think this is really dficult and Iaposm not going to pretend thereaposs a clear black and white, yes-no easy answer on this. It is extremely dficult.  My instinct is that...we get the virus properly under control, the death rates are near zero, hospital admissions very, very low, that the British instinct in those circumstances will be against vaccine passports. It came as a minister signalled more details will be revealed when the Prime Minister gives a press conference on Easter Monday. Michael Gove is leading a review of certication, which could involve people using a re-tooled NHS Covid- app to show theyaposve had the vaccine, a rapid test or both.Minister Gillian Keegan said: We will be getting some reports on this - they’re looking at it at the moment, on April  it’s due back to Michael Gove to look at the pros and cons on this.Itaposs thought Boris Johnson is planning a trio of updates on certication, travel and the April  lockdown easing on Easter Monday. If Sir Keir orders Labour MPs to vote against vaccine passports, and enough lockdown-sceptic Tory rebels revolt, it could derail the move. The PM, who previously rejected vaccine passports, now believes landlords could be able to ask for proof before pulling a pint. But Labouraposs leader said: I think this idea that we sort of outsource this to inidual landlords is just wrong in principle. Sources claried that Sir Keir had not yet made a decision on opposing passports, but said they could end up being a huge potential burden on businesses. A senior Labour source said: At the moment we’ve got to wait and see what the government actually propose. If in nine monthsapos time the vaccine’s been totally deployed, nearly everyone’s got the vaccine, does it then make sense to introduce vaccine passports  "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror complacent race report","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Complacent race report insulted those it was meant to serveThe Race Commission report has done black and Asian communities a disservice, neglecting the chance to set out a clear path for tackling ingrained inequality and injusticemirrorShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video britain-not-institutionally-racist-says-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:MkOHucDQ,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

But that is no reason to rest on our laurels or pretend racism does not exist here. And that is why the Race Commission report has done black and Asian communities a disservice. The Commission appeared more interested in provoking a row than seeking to tackle hatred and discrimination. Its claim there is no evidence of institutional racism flies in the face of polling by Hope Not Hate which found % of black Britons and British Asians have experienced or witnessed racial abuse in the past  months and % think Britain is institutionally racist. The Commission needs to explain how it could reach such a conclusion when the figures show that black Britons are excluded from the higher ranks of almost every major profession and that people from ethnic minorities are twice as likely to be unemployed and have been twice as likely to die from Covid. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section This was a chance to set out a clear path for tackling ingrained inequality and injustice. This complacent report failed in that task, and insulted the people it was meant to serve. Laid to waste Our parks have been more important than ever during lockdown.

He gave a narrative conclusion due to the complexities of the case and said the nub of the inquest was a mm gallstone. Rettaposs syndrome was a factor but not a cause of her death, he added.

The thugs armed themselves with knives, machetes and firearms to carry out a string of violent robberies on home owners and drivers across London. Their victims included Arsenal stars Mezut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac who were ambushed in Hampstead, north west London, in July . Bosnian international Kolasinac, , was a passenger in teammate Ozilaposs black Mercedes G-Class jeep when -year-old gang member Jordan Northover tried to rob the sportsmen of their £, watches at the point of a knitting needle on July , . CCTV footage shows Kolasinac, known as aposThe Tankapos, jumping out of the passenger seat of Ozilaposs £, x to fight off Northover who prods him with the needle. The players were targeted when Ozil, , was picking up one of the luxury timepieces which had both been delivered to his teammateaposs address. Northover jabbed Kolasinac with the needle in front of Ozilaposs newlywed we who watched in horror from the car. Ozil, who earns £, per-week, then sped away down the wrong side of a mansion-lined road in Childs Hill and took refuge at a Turkish restaurant.  In another robbery a driver was waiting in his car when a machete was forced through the window on  April. He ran from his car but was chased, threatened and made to hand over his Rolex. In another attack on May  last year five of the gang burst into a house in Finchley.  They forced a locked bedroom door and pushed the -year-old female occupant to the floor. They smashed her wardrobes and demanded to know where the safe was but left when the terried victim told them she did not have one. On  June  a woman was at home with her two children in Golders Green when two burglars wearing balaclavas forced entry with a crowbar. She tried to deter them from entering by holding up her phone saying that she was calling the police and then ran and hid upstairs as the raiders stole the keys to her black Audi. Five of the gang struck again the next day in St Johnaposs Wood, forcing open the victimaposs locked bedroom door. They ordered him to hand over cash and jewellery at knepoint but he told them he had lost his belongings in a previous raid.  He was threatened with a gun before the gang fled as police arrived. Two days later on  July, four members of the gang terrorised a couple when they forced their way into a home in Brondesbury Park through a bathroom window. The occupants awoke to find the masked men in their bedroom and were forced to open their safe after one of them threatened to aposgo and seeapos a daughterapos who was sleeping next door. Detectives had them under observation and watched on  July  as four masked members of the gang carried out a burglary in Barnet Gate. The raiders set off an alarm and fled empty handed in an Audi they had stolen in the Golders Green burglary. Just over  minutes later detectives watching them in an unmarked car in Thurlow Crescent, Hampstead, were astonished as gang members approached the vehicle, intent on robbing them.  Officers called in reinforcements as the gang used a metal bar in an attempt to smash the car window. The four raiders sped off in a stolen car with a police helicopter giving chase and they were all arrested nearby. In all,  offences are believed to have been committed by ious members of the gang. Detective Sergeant Gary Taylor from the Flying Squad, said: The way this gang targeted their victims and threatened them with weapons during their crime spree was truly shocking and abhorrent. The impact these heinous crimes have had on the victims cannot be understated. These defendants wrongly thought they wouldnapost be caught. However, Flying Squad officers were able to close the net on these robbers and bring them into custody after a proactive surveillance operation.  The following were found guilty following a four-week trial beginning on Monday,  November : Patrick Delaney, , of Camden was sentenced to a total of  yearsapos imprisonment for conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary and attempted robbery. Martin Delaney, , of Camden was sentenced to a total of  yearsapos imprisonment for attempted robbery and robbery. Kiaron Jones-Hewitt, , of West Hampstead was sentenced to eight yearsapos imprisonment for attempted robbery. Andy Kiasuka-Kiakanda, , of St Johnaposs Wood, was sentenced to a total of  years and four monthsapos imprisonment after he admitted conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary, and a further offence of robbery.

And the lting of Covid restrictions this week also means we can travel away from our local areas to find a beach or beauty spot.Last month Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK’s chief scientic adviser, told MPs that while the outdoors isn’t completely risk free “it is the case that it is dficult to see how things like large beach gatherings and so on can cause a spike” in coronavirus cases.But with tourist spots likely to be packed, what are the ways we can enjoy them as safely as possible  Here, Azeem Majeed, the head of the department of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, gives his ten top tips… Will you be getting out and about  Let us know in the comment section   Travel safely. If you are travelling by car, try to travel with people from your household or support bubble. If using public transport, make sure you wear a face mask. The best way to travel is by foot or bicycle but this won’t be practical for more distant locations.  Follow Covid- rules on how many people can meet. In England, you can currently meet with a maximum of five other peoplethey are from more than two other households. Make sure your total group size does not exceed six peoplethis is the case. If there are people from just two households meeting, then your group can be bigger than six people.  Keep your distance from other people. There will be many other people also out and about. Try to keep at least two metres away from others who are not in your groupthey will be near you for a prolonged period. The virus that causes Covid- spreads from person to person by droplets or through an aerosol. Outdoors, the virus will disperse quickly and the risk of infection is very lowyou are not near other people.  Don’t share food and drink. You should use separate cups, plates and utensils for each person present and not share them as sharing will increase the risk of infection. You should also avoid sharing food because this has been shown to increase the risk of infection.  Be aware of the greater risks in indoor spaces such as toilets. At some point, you may have to use to use a public toilet. The risk of infection is substantially higher in indoor spaces – particularlythey are crowded, used by lots of people and are poorly ventilated. Avoid coming into close contact with others while indoors. You should also wear a face mask or face covering, and wash or sanitise your hands before entering. After using the toilet, wash your hands thoroughly and go back outside immediately once you finish. Avoid touching surfaces. Surfaces such as hand rails will have been touched by many other people and will be contaminated. If you do touch a surface that many people have been in contact with, wash or sanitize your hands as soon as possible.  Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer regularly. This will remove any virus that you may have inadvertently picked up from a surface or from someone , and help to protect yourself and protect others.  Avoid alcohol. People are more likely to engage in behaviour and activity that increase their risk of infection when they are drinking."},{"url":null,"title":"join grace celebrate women inspirational","story":"NewsJoin Grace as we celebrate women with inspirational and powerful storiesYou are being invited to join our community as we share with you stories which celebrate and inspire women - and men - from our network of websitesmirrorShareCommentsByKelly-Ann MillsReporter:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsGrace will share stories with you Mirror readers are being invited to sign up to our new and free newsletter which will bring you stories presented through a female lens directly to your inbox each week.

She claimed a member of the royal family raised concerns about the colour of the childaposs skin - but declined to name who. Lady C alleged in her video that Meghan weaponised some of the objections to her on the grounds of colour. She said: No one is the guilty party in terms of racism.  And she added: There were no concerns about Meghanaposs colour. Princess Anne was rightly concerned thatthe marriage proceeded and there were children there would be huge problems. Not because of Meghanaposs colour, but because of Meghanaposs inability and determination to remain unable to appreciate the cultural dferences. And to actually have respect for the institution into which she was going to be marrying and the family into which she was marrying.

Non-negotiable, without nuance, leaving no room for discussion or debate. If you’re a litterbug – like those who celebrated being allowed to mix outside in good weather by leaving waste strewn everywhere – you’re rubbish. Simple as that. A few years ago, there was someone I was vaguely acquainted with, moved in similar circles to, who I really liked. Every time we bumped into each other we got on better and better, I thought this was the beginning of a beautul friendship, and I was pleased about it. Then one day I saw her, from a distance, having a picnic in the park with her children. As I began to walk towards her to say hello, they all got up, ready to go home. And then they just left. Their wrappers, cartons and empty packets lay on the grass behind them as they ambled away, without a care in the world. I genuinely stopped in my tracks. As did any chance of us ever being friends. There’s no excuse or explanation that could suffice, she’s a litterbug. The end. Dropping litter is technically an “environmental offence” for which there’s a fine of up to £. This is clearly not enough of a deterrent though, because more than two millions bits of it are dropped in the UK every day, according to Keep Britain Tidy.  This is an issue that affects all of us, it makes our daily environment grim and is awful for – even though it sounds like hyperbole – the very future of our planet. Dropping litter is lazy, selfish and gross. Anyone who does it should be ashamed of themselves, but they obviously aren’t, therefore they need to BE shamed. So badly that they would never even consider being that vile and inconsiderate ever again. Putting them in stocks, and letting passers-by throw their litter back at them would be the ideal solution, but maybe that’s a bit medieval...

Photos show a lack of social distancing, brawls involving young people and police clearing drinkers from parks as record-setting temperatures climbed above C this week.Police sources told thethat enforcing the rule of six is very, very dficult due to the Governmentaposs decision to allow two households to meet outside, with some saying the new aposstay localapos rule is confusing. What do you think of the Governmentaposs four-step plan to ease Englandaposs lockdown  Join the conversation in the comments section below.A senior policing source added: We made it very, very clear to Government that they have made it almost impossible to enforce the rule of six. It used to be relatively simple. As long as you can count to six, you can enforce it, as seven is beyond the rule. Now you could have  people in a group,  from each household. That makes it very, very dficult. How do you prove that they donapost live in the same house  Sources told thepolice would take a more permissive approach with less enforcement and more engage, encourage and explain as more people are vaccinated and infection rates fall.

Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefsapos Council, admitted the rule of six and two households rule make it more of a challenge for officers to distinguish between who is and who isnapost breaching restrictions. But he said he was confident that most people will follow the rules. He said police would focus on incidents that pose the highest health risk to the public, such as large indoor gatherings.  On Wednesday, police cleared drinkers from Castlefield Bowl in Manchester city centre, where hundreds had gathered for a rave with a live DJ, leaving piles of rubbish behind. Fights broke out at Hyde Park in Leeds as young people gathered to drink. Nottingham City Council closed the Arboretum and Lenton Recreation Ground after people brawled earlier in the week. But more than  people gathered at the Forest Recreation Ground on Wednesday, leaving litter scattered in the grass.

The post-Brexit measures have already seen a group of British expats kicked out of Spain just minutes after arriving there. There are also fears for thousands of pensioners who are already living in Spain, but itaposs not the only country thataposs affected by the changes. The rules are to do with the residency status of foreigners living in European countries and as the UK has left the EU that means the protection previously afforded to Brits no longer stand. It has been claimed that some British expats have been aposburying their heads in the sandsapos despite being warned the changes were looming. There have been unconfirmed reports police in the Costas are ready to boot out  aposillegalapos UK citizens while in other EU countries Brits living there will also face challenges. Here we look at the new rules and what it means for you.Have you or someone you know been affected by the Brexit rules in Spain  Contact us at webnews@mirrorWhat are some of the new rules affecting British ex-pats Brits overseas, including tourists and second-home owners, are no longer allowed to spend more than  days in the EU without residency, as of April . Those who fail to apply for a residency or have it rejected needed to leave by March  or be deemed an illegal immigrant. For any future ex-pats, each nation has a tailored requirement for residency that now applies to Brits as non-EU members and it can take months to get a decision. But these arenapost the only rules that are causing problems for some Brits. One of the other requirements in Spain means expats earning less than £, a year could also face deportation. This will potentially affect thousands of British pensioners living there, whose only source of income is the UKaposs state pension of just over £, a year. Spain has also been rolling out a new system to register permanent foreign residents with biometric cards called TIE but due to so many requests the process has ground to a halt. And in France, Brits have been told they must swap their UK driving licence for a French one in a few months time or they will be unable to drive legally.The situation is further complicated by the travel restrictions placed on countries currently due to the coronavirus pandemic, with many European nations facing a third wave of infections. Why is it happening now  When the UK left the EU on January ,  a withdrawal agreement set the terms of the UK’s departure and the transition period ended on December , . This meant EU freedom of movement laws would no longer apply. As such Brits are no longer entitled to the same treatment as when the UK was still part of the European Union, including the right to live and work overseas. Wednesday, March  was the key date as it was  days after the end of transition and so the first time Brits would be affected by the new  day stay limit. Referring to the situation in Spain, a spokesman for the British embassy in Madrid said: When making plans to travel from the UK to Spain, a UK national must make sure that they meet both the requirements to leave the UK and those to enter Spain, bearing in mind that they are not the same. From March , entry to Spain will only be granted to those passengers who can demonstrate that their journey is essential, as well as those who are already legally resident in Spain. Ultimately, the decision on whether to grant entry into Spain is made by Spanish border officials. Can Brit expats still live overseas  If a Brit became a legal resident of the EU before January , , they will be allowed to stay. Those with legal residence can continue to have broadly the same rights to work, study and access public services and benefits as before the UK left the EU. If you have lived in an EU country for less than five years then will be able to stay for as long as you meet one of the residence conditions.Each country has dferent requirements, and you can find out what they are on the UK Government website here.You must spend at least  months in any  month period in your EU country to keep your residence rights. Brits who want to move overseas and become expats in the EU post-Brexit can still do so but will find it a more complicated process than before.

Lynn Prestage said she paid £ to hire the skip after her mum died and asked a third-party company to collect it on Friday which was the day of the funeral. However when Lytham St Annes Skip Hire arrived to collect the skip Monday from Lynnaposs home in Blackpool, Lancashire, they said it had double the amount of waste that the skip would hold. The local firm claim Lynn had ordered a small skip which was packed with too much waste for them to safely remove and she became abusive when they broke the news to her. It is claimed the skip operator drove off after three mattresses were laid on top of the household waste before he ed an hour.  The video clip uploaded on Facebook by Lynn shows the rubbish on her driveway.She wrote: This is what happens when you pay £ for a skip, only for them to moan about taking mattresses when it was confirmed as ok. He thought it was acceptable to empty the lot over our drive.  Now itaposs a fight to get our money backthey answer the phone.Speaking from her home Lynn told The Sun the skip driver refused to take the load of mattresses, drove off and ed an hour later.She said: He hooked up the skip, cut the rope we had used to hold down the load, and proceeded to drag the skip down my driveway.  The contents were fly-tipped on my driveway as we had an argument with the driver. Now the company says we will have to wait to get our money back. Lytham St Annes Skip Hire wrote a statement on its Facebook page saying it was a case of a customer trying to get more than what they have paid for.  The post read: You may see a video being shared of a skip having been tipped out on a driveway by ourselves. This was a result of a customer who booked through a third party broker attempting to dispose of double the amount of waste that the skip would hold. We had attempted to collect the skip once and had a wasted journey, and asked the customer to level the load.

While salons remain closed across the country there is plenty we can all be getting on with at home to keep our hair its healthiest. More often than not, split ends are caused by heat damage, so hide those curling irons and straighteners! Prevention is usually better than a cure. The more we add heat to already split ends the more prominent and visible those damaged ends will become. Reducing the heat used on your hair is the easiest and most effective way to recover tired ends. To try and conceal and hide the ends look into air-drying your hair or using a slower less intense speed on your hairdryer. Split ends show up much more clearly on straight hair. If you have naturally curly hair stop torturing the curls with your hot tools and scrunch dry with product.  The expert went on to share some advice for washing hair and giving it a bit of love. He recommends using a scalp scrub, saying: Give your hair a spa day! So many people spend time looking after their face and skin with a y routine and ritual, however people’s hair is often overlooked. Much like an exfoliant for the face, give your scalp some TLC with a scalp scrub. My favourite is RCO Crown Scalp Scrub. This helps remove any product build-up or dry skin. Follow this with a lovely moisturising, hydrating shampoo to add some much-needed love back into your hair. Lastly, after towel drying as to not dilute the product, smother the hair in a hydrating mask. With plenty to choose from on the market my personal favourite tends to be RCO Atlantis range. I recommend repeating this procedure every other week.

Terrorism in West Africa was already the new frontline against global jihad, with  British among , UN troops on a peace-keeping missions there. In a separate struggle , French soldiers are involved in ferocious firefights against jihadists in the region and the security nightmare is spreading. French expert on jihad Olivier Guitta, from Global Risk Consultancy warned recently: “Africa is going to be the battleground of jihad for the next  years and it’s going to replace the Middle East.” Thousands of local troops from African countries are also engaged in the struggle to beat back the jhadists, whose numbers seem to grow by the day. Terrorism is already threatening the entire Sahel region of sub-Sahara Africa, with flashpoints in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger after migrating from Libya, Chad and further north all the way from the Middle East. But carnage also , miles away, in Palma, north Mozambique, in southern Africa, underlines a terrying expansion in terror attacks by Islamist terror groups across the entire continent. And though they appeared to be an ISIS-linked rabble, retired Colonel Lionel Dyck, whose private security company employees fought the insurgents, warned: “These were a dferent calibre of terrorist.” It is also feared the weapons they used, such as mortars, were brought in from neighbouring Tanzania and the fighters appeared battle-hardened and even trained. One security analyst said: “The problem is that once Islamic State was defeated in the Middle East and came to a halt in Libya its fighters had to migrate. “Many of them moved into Chad and Niger and gravitated across to Mali, exploiting ungoverned space and an insecure government in Mali to form bases. “Couple that with poverty, disaffected youth, civil wars and general dissatisfaction and you have an an ideal recruiting tool to attract very angry jihadists. “It almost doesn’t matterthey are Islamic State - there has been fluid movements between ISIS and al-Qaeda and all the other networks and jihad sub-franchisees.  “Some groups have even organised job-swaps, where you can do a kind of paid internship in another group to learn another form of guerilla terrorism. “And it is spreading, because as we have seen in Mozambique, weak local security forces mean unless a government is directly threatened they are unable to come down hard. “Andyou think it doesn’t affect Britain, then think again - we have a huge diaspora in the UK and it only takes one person to become enthused by jihad to launch an attack. “But it is also true to say that British firms have billions invested in oil companies and other financial interests across the continent.”  Experts also fear that many attacks, like the one in Mozambique, are sparked by local grievances from groups who then latch on to Islamic State and attract jihad fighters. This chilling clearing house system across swathes of Africa means groups “bleed” into neighbouring areas, gravitating towards the latest flashpoint. Sometimes they are paid to fight by local organisations but often the rewards of pillage and robbery are enough to encourage it, all in the name of their chosen form of militancy. Global warming has also created food shortages, water shortages, migration and crippling poverty, again driving poverty-stricken youths into the arms of the jihadi network.  A recent study by global risk researchers at Verisk Maplecroft discovered seven out of ten of the world’s most dangerous countries are now in Africa. Their report warns: “Violence in Africa’s terrorist hotspots is getting worse and the risk of attacks is rising in many countries across the region, including some previously considered safe. “The quarterly ranking of the  countries show sub-Saharan Africa is now home to seven of the worlds riskiest locations, making it the worst performing region globally.” The warning comes as in Mali, a multi-European force is backing local troops in the UN’s Operation Minusma as well as the French-led counter fighting missions Operation Barkhane.  British “ranger battalions” will be ready for deployment to train and fight alongside local forces against terror in Africa later this year in small, highly trained units. Hundreds of British mobile infantry are based in Gao, Mali, protecting locals in long-range desert patrols as French troops to the north are fighting ferocious battles against insurgents. And the past four years in countries such as Senegal, Kenya and Nigeria British troops have been training local forces how to fight the growing terror threat. Mali, Burkina Faso, Western Niger  Jamat at Nusrat al Islam Wal Muslimeenis a coalition of armed groups with al-Qaeda links but also connections to criminal gangs and truly deadly. This armed mob is responsible for around , attacks in the past year and the killing of around , people. This group has devastated the Sahel region. Also present in these three countries is Islamic State in West Africa, an offshoot from a split in Boko Haram in Nigeria and which encouraged locals to consider it a kind of “Boko lite” by being nicer to locals and concentrating more on military targets than civilians. Nigeria  Boko Haram- Means “westernisation is sacrilege.” An ISIS supporting lunatic insurgency, mostly locally funded through robbery, extortion, ransacking, kidnapping, taking over villages. Holding ground in the north east. Infamous for kidnapping hundreds of schoolgirls. It has killed more than , people and displaced more. Here there is also the splinter-group from Boko called ISIS in West Africa or ISWA, formed in  as a split-off from Boko and responsible for thousands of killings. Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania  Al-Shabaab, or “the young men” and one of the most deadly and well-established al-Qaeda sub-isions. Formed in Somalia in  it did not sign up to al-Qaeda for another six years and is behind large-scale and well-organised insurgent attacks such as the  Westgate Shopping Mall assault. They have spread into neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania. There are also fears they may have had a loose relationship with elements from Boko Haram. They have killed tens of thousands.

Lance Karlson, , first saw the aposangryapos sea creature when it lashed out at a seagull near Ramada resort at Geographe Bay, Australia. After setting up a sun protection tent for his family on the beach, Karlston put on goggles and went in the water alone to explore a collection of crab shells. As he was swimming, he felt another whip across his arm - followed by a more forceful sting across his neck and upper back. My goggles became fogged, the water was suddenly murky and I remember being shocked and confused, Karlson said. Karlson said he raced back to shore and saw raised imprints of tentacles across his arm, neck and upper back. Since he did not have vinegar, his preferred treatment for sea animal stings, he poured cola over the affected area, which worked well to stop the stinging. The footage Karlson posted with the comment: The angriest octopus in Geographe Bay! was widely shared, but he said he felt apprehension but no animosity toward the animal. This was clearly the octopusaposs domain, he said. I am worried that people will view octopuses in a dferent light. They are amazing creatures that clearly have some strong emotions!

Last March it was selling an average of , bottles.Several of its new milk delivery workers were self-employed taxi drivers who experienced a slump in demand as more people stayed at home.Kenny Walker, commercial relationship manager at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: “It has been rewarding to help enable this exciting new chapter for Kelvin Kerr Jnr and his team as they re-locate to a larger headquarters to match the unbelievable demand for their services.“Their commitment to delivering high-quality products and building strong relationships with the communities they deliver to is evident.“The funding boost will allow the team to continue the already top-class job they are doing with confidence.“I look forward to hearing about their future success as we continue a positive relationship with the firm.”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/20090117_38385655-e1616891338356-620x372.jpg ","title":"james mcpake wants more set piece success from dundee with st johnstone next in the firing line","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remDundee manager James McPake is hoping for a hat-trick of set play heroics from his team when they face St Johnstone.The Dark Blues host the newly-crowned Betfred Cup winners at Dens Park on Saturday in one of the ties of the Scottish Cup’s third round.McPake’s men go into the tricky-looking fixture against in-form Saints with a lot of momentum themselves, having roared back from two goals down to beat Dunfermline - in a dramatic Championship clash on Saturday night.That followed on from a comfortable - win away to Alloa eight days earlier.Both matches were graced by well-worked goals scored by the Dark Blues via set pieces, with Lee Ashcroft’s head getting on the end of Paul McGowan’s corners.The combination has yielded three goals for Ashcroft himself, while another of his headers off a McGowan delivery was saved by Pars keeper Owain Fon Williams before Danny Mullen tapped in the loose ball.There is no doubt that canny Saints boss Callum Davidson will have that particular threat written down in his notebook for the cup-tie, but McPake will still be hoping they can still hurt the Premiership top-six side.The Dundee boss said: “We spend a lot of time on them and set plays are huge in football.“You see games won and lost because of them all the time.“It was a set play that enabled us to get a foothold against Alloa in the game the other week.“Then we got back to - against Dunfermline thanks to one before our winning goal, which was also scored from a set play.“So they really are important.“I would be lyingI was standing here and taking any credit for that because it is about good deliveries and players being brave.“I think that is now two good wins for us now going into what is a massive Scottish Cup tie, with St Johnstone coming here.“They have had a great season under Callum and made the top six and won a cup so it’s going to be a test of our character again.“However, I know we will work hard again and show the belief that we have been doing.“It is one I am looking forward to.”McPake admitted, looking back, that the Dunfermline match was a must-win for him and his players and is delighted that they passed that formidable test.He added: “It think it was a must-win but you would never come out and say that before the game as you would fall flat on your faceyou didn’t win.“Then you would be looking for answers.“But, with these last two results and the way it’s being going for the players, we are looking forward to Saturday.”LEE WILKIE: St Johnstone clash can give Dundee an indicator of where they#re at and why a Scottish Cup run could be transformative for Dundee United\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: St Johnstone clash can give Dundee an indicator of where they#re at and why a Scottish Cup run could be transformative for Dundee United# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-column-dundee-fc-dundee-united-st-johnstone-scottish-cup embed # secretNhOePHygC\" data-secret\"NhOePHygC\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"brush-britains-marilyn-dream-come-true-glasgow-teen","story":"IT IS no wonder teenage boy Iain Henderson thought he was dreaming back in Glasgow in ."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-reverend-effie-irvine-pioneering-woman-minister-made-scottish-history","story":" Reverend Effie Irvine made history when she became the first woman minister appointed to a parish in Scotland.

upgrades at a major Aberdeen junction is being carried out – just months after delays were announced.In December, it emerged the completion date for improvement works at the Haudagain Roundabout, one of the busiest in the north-east, had been pushed back from spring to winter this year.The delay marked the fth time the £ million project had been pushed back in as many years.Now Transport Scotland – the Scottish Government’s transport body – has revealed the new date is now being reviewed in order to factor in “unforeseen circumstances” such as future Covid- restrictions or extreme weather.Holyrood transport minister Michael Matheson said: “The construction of the A A Haudagain improvement project is progressing.“Due to the Covid- pandemic and the measures to combat the impact of the pandemic, as confirmed in the recent publication of the Infrastructure Investment Plan in December  completion has changed from the original published date of spring  and is now anticipated in winter .“While this date is subject to any further impacts of the pandemic and unforeseen circumstances such as the effects of exceptional weather, Transport Scotland is working with the contractor to review the programme of work and identy any actions which may help to mitigate delays where possible.”Meanwhile ministers have been urged to “come clean” over cost rises associated with any delays at the Aberdeen junction – amid fears the public could face an increased bill of millions of pounds because of the over-run.Scottish Conservative candidate for Aberdeen Donside Harriet Cross said: “The SNP are burying their head in the sand with the cost projections of the Haudagain in the hope no one notices the increasing costs associated with the delays.“It’s shocking and a slap in the face to the people of Aberdeen who have to deal with the ongoing disruption caused by these delays. They want to see this project finished as soon as possible but also want, and deserve, it to be value for money.“I understand the impact of Covid but the project has been up and running for several months now – they can’t use that as a constant excuse for even more delays , especially given the disruption these are causing to those living and working in Aberdeen.“Taxpayers were left millions of pounds out of pocket with the reckless spending that occurred for the AWPR and it seems like history will repeat itself with the Haudagain project.“I’m calling on the SNP to do the decent thing and come clean about timescales and spending for the scheme.“Motorists and residents in the likes of Bridge of Don and Woodside have had to wait  years for one of Europe’s worst roundabouts to finally be addressed – they don’t need another repeat of the out-of-control spending that has occurred in similar projects.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/01/KTX_150121-01-010_37508877-2-848x564.jpg ","title":"north east adult first dose","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remMore than half of all adults in the north-east have now received the first dose of their Covid- vaccination.The number of people who have received their first jag has passed the , mark this week.All adults in the north-east are now expected to be offered at least one dose by July, rather than September as was previously announced.NHS Grampian announced the news in an update to staff on Wednesday, and also revealed the health board will begin phase two of its vaccine rollout # offering second doses # in the coming weeks.In the update, the health board said: We are delighted to say that the number of#The progress we have made in this vaccination programme continues to be phenomenal and the product of an enormous ongoing team effort.

Aberdeen is quite far up north, it#s far away from everyone , it#s quite a big move to make but having a name like John Lewis it makes it not feel as far away, it puts us on the map.#It#s a big employer, a lot of students can go to John Lewis on placement, so it#s a big part of the community there.#We don#t have any other department stores here anymore and it is important to have that one-stop shop andwe lose this, it will be very sad.#For people relocating, it can be quite a big thing to have a John Lewis in the city and when you are trying to attract people up here, it is definitely a draw.#Ms Morgan has many fond memories of working in the store between  and , and made a lelong friend while travelling to work on the train from Stonehaven.A fellow colleague started up a conversation with her after spotting her badge, and they are still friends today.Ms Morgan said: #I absolutely loved working there, there was a fantastic community spirit, there were other students there from the city and it was such a vibrant place, with a good atmosphere and good social element as well.#It was a great place to meet local people and be part of something, I was proud to be part of it, working in the city and with the brands I grew up with, I#m from Kent originally so I knew John Lewis in Milton Keynes so loved working there.#I learned so many interpersonal skills there as it was such a nice place to work.#John Lewis helped me settle into Aberdeen when I moved here and starting working there as I was mixing with people all dferent ages from the city, and felt like I became part of the city.#The -year-old has lived in Aberdeenshire since she was  and backed our campaign to save the store from closure.She added: #We need the profile of John Lewis being in Aberdeen, we don#t need another empty building of that size.#I don#t knowJohn Lewis#s mind has been fixed, orits too late to save it, but we need to try and convince them that it is financially viable to keep open.#Local people need to get involved and pledge to put their money where their mouth is, we need to really do something as a community, and the councillors to show them the wider picture of the

sculpture trail will arrive in Aberdeen for  days next month – and city art bosses say it will mark ato people enjoying arts in the city centre.Restless Worlds will see moving installations in windows and public spaces offering “magical worlds” created by some of Scotland’s leading sculptors, animators and puppeteers at eight sites around the city centre, from May  to .The art walk is being staged in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow by Puppet Animation Scotland under the banner of its MANIPULATE Festival, with Aberdeen Performing Arts as partners in the Granite City.Ben Torrie, director of programming and creative projects for APA, said: “We’re looking forward to bringing some much needed joy and offering something for everyone to look forward to. The sculptures and artwork are extraordinary and take in some iconic locations around the city so we are looking forward to sharing them.“More than that, right now, it’s a step back to enjoying artistic experiences like we all love to do, but have been deprived of in the past  months.”The eight artists commissioned to create the works have been inspired by Boccaccio’s  novel The Decameron.Ben said: “It is about a group of  people quarantining from a plague, who are telling each other stories to pass the time, stories which get ever more ridiculous. It was like a lockdown for them, the th century version of Covid-.”While all eight sites have yet to be confirmed, Ben said one, possibly two, sculptures will be in the glass foyer of His Majesty’s Theatre. Wherever the sculptures are, they can be viewed from the street, keeping the trail Covid-secure.Ben said: “The full experience involves purchasing a ticket and downloading the full map and all the detailed information about the pieces, with an accompanying soundtrack of both music and narrative.“I think in and of itself it’s a really interesting artwork trail and hopefully will take people by surprise. You will have little moments of curiosity as you are going about the city centre.”Restless Worlds had been planned as part of the MANIPULATE festival, but was postponed due to Covid- restrictions, as the event moved online in February.Dawn Taylor, Puppet Animation Scotland’s director said: “We are so excited to finally be able to share these works with the public after having to postpone our original plans due to the lockdown.“The installation features both leading Scottish artists and exciting emerging new voices, who between them have an extraordinary range of backgrounds, including puppetry, sculpture, filmmaking, object theatre, photography, generative design and theatre.“After so long without access to theatres and galleries, Restless Worlds offers audiences a really unique and distinctive Covid-safe arts experience – part exhibition, part storytelling, and something you can enjoy at your own pace as you wander around the city.”To find out more and purchase tickets,

were due to meet bosses at John Lewis today in a bid to convince the retail giant to remain in Aberdeen.Last week the chain announced plans to close the branch on George Street – the northernmost in the UK and the only Scottish store outside the central belt.The closure of the outlet would lead to the loss of  jobs, although any final decision on its future would be subject to a consultation with staff.Yesterday we revealed a taskforce – including council leaders and key figures in Aberdeen’s business scene – had been set up to lobby the chain to keep the store open.It was due to meet with bosses at John Lewis for the first time earlier today.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden, who along with fellow administration chiefs Jenny Laing and Marie Boulton sits on the taskforce, said he hoped recent “big announcements” regarding investment in the city would be taken into account.“There have been a lot of big announcements in Aberdeen recently,” Mr Lumsden said.“There is the energy transition zone and the energy transition fund from the government.“As a local authority we have also pledged £ million into city centre redevelopment as well so there is a lot going on and we want to make sure John Lewis are aware of all the good things going on in the local economy before making a final decision.“In the whole of the north region our earnings are still above average. We might have had a tough couple of years but we do see some good signs for the future and it would be goodJohn Lewis were part of that.“I understandsomeone from John Lewis was just looking at the numbers and is only seeing sales falling, but we would urge them to look at the bigger picture and the investment coming to the area. We hope they would take all that into consideration before making a final decision.”It is understood a key issue for the retailer is the size of the outlet, with bosses at John Lewis believing they do not need , square feet of space.However, the taskforce is keen to explore alternatives that could entice the retailer to reconsider its decision.One possibility being considered is that of opening a smaller John Lewis branch, along with a Waitrose store, either within the same building or in another location in the city centre.However, that option would require vehicle access and parking.Eventhe outlet does close down, John Lewis would still need to pay business rates and other costs such as security, since it is the owner of the building.The taskforce sees the branch as vital not just for Aberdeen, but for the whole of the north of Scotland, with the city as a whole viewed as a shopping hub for people in Aberdeenshire, Moray and the Highlands.One of the major fears among members of the group is a “domino” effect, where other businesses in the city close as a result of John Lewis’ withdrawal from Aberdeen.A petition calling for the retailer to rethink its proposal has gained more than , signatures since it was set up last week.Adrian Watson, chief executive of Aberdeen Inspired, said: “We had a detailed meeting between Aberdeen City Council leaders and other business organisation leads and we now carry this strong collective will to the table.#It was lost on no one what John Lewis partnership’s presence in Aberdeen means to the city and indeed the wider north of Scotland.“For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

Do Not Attempt Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitationorders were imposed without discussion with the person or their families.Mr Bowie, MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, has dealt with several constituents who felt compelled to sign an order or had one applied without their consent.He said the review in England brought a #harrowing number of justied complaints to light#.The DNACPR form is usually agreed between a person and their doctor, guiding medics in the event a patient#s heart or breathing stops.The Conservative MP has joined Mr Jack in calls to the incoming Scottish Government to follow suit and conduct a review into similar decisions made north of the border.Mr Bowie said: #CQC#s investigation confirmed that blanket use of DNACPR was wrong.#Since last summer I#ve been dealing with Age Scotland and other charities about the scale of the problem in Scotland.#There have been horror stories which will stay with me for a long time.#I urge the SNP to accept it#s time for the same level of scrutiny to apply north of the border.#In response to a written question from Mr Bowie, the Scottish Secretary said it is important for governments to work across the whole of the UK to #build understanding of the role DNACPR decisions play in high-quality personalised care#.He added: #As public health is a devolved matter, I would call on the incoming Scottish Government, following Scottish elections in May, to listen to patients, families and care organisations who have serious concerns about the use of DNACPR orders during the Covid- pandemic.#Age Scotland has led calls for an investigation into the use of DNACPRs during the Covid- pandemic and believes there are #numerous examples# across Scotland of #unorthodox# use of do not resuscitate orders.It comes after the charity was contacted by older people and their families who received calls from their GPs, asking them to agree to the order, and patients who discovered paperwork in their hospital discharge notes that had been completed without their knowledge.We revealed last year that an Aberdeenshire woman was left crying for hours after feeling pressured into signing a do not resuscitate form over the phone.Brian Sloan, chief executive of Age Scotland, said there is #growing support# for a review into the way DNACPR decisions were applied in the past year.He added: #We know from calls to our helpline that a number of older people and their families in Scotland have been very concerned and angry about these decisions in the past year.#We have heard from over-s, who considered themselves in good health, who felt pressured into agreeing not to receive medical interventiontheir heart or breathing stopped.#Others have even found completed forms in their hospital discharge notes, with no knowledge of having agreed to it. These practices are completely unacceptable and have left people feeling their lives are less valued because of their age.#Mr Sloan added that while the orders have an #important place# in care planning, decisions #must be made on a case-by-case basis, following an honest discussion between a patient and doctor, and respecting the patient#s wishes#.He said: #This has understandably caused a great deal of alarm and upset to older people at an extremely challenging time.#We would like to see cast-iron guarantees that this practice is applied correctly and with compassion in the future.#A Scottish Government spokesman said: #As we have previously said, no one should ever feel pressured in any way whatsoever when discussing treatment options – and the Covid- pandemic has brought about absolutely no change to the use of Do Not Attempt CPR forms in NHS Scotland, and no change to the advice issued to clinicians about their use.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our

by Aberdeen FC to turn the Pittodrie Stadium site into a Dons-themed amusement park, the Evening Express can reveal today.It is understood a rollercoaster – dubbed the Willie Millie Thriller – and spinning cups shaped like the  European Cup Winners’ Cup are just some of the rides planned for the football funfair, which will be called Pittodrieland.A high-speed rollercoaster is also currently being designed that will replicate the feeling players got when legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson gave them the ‘hairdryer treatment’.Renowned Danish theme park designer Olaf Proil, who has created rides for Copenhagen’s famous Tivoli Gardens, is in charge of plans for the proposed attraction.He said: “When the club got in touch with me earlier this year about Pittodrieland I jumped at the chance to get involved.“The site itself has provided over a century of incredible football and I hope a theme park based around those historic moments will provide future generations with great memories.“Aberdeen FC have given me carte blanche to dream up a theme park that will hopefully draw fans and tourists from far and wide.“Disneyland has Mickey Mouse and Pittodrieland will have Angus the Bull.”A spokesman for the club was tight-lipped about fairground plans.He said: “It’s too early to go into detail about our plans for Pittodrie, however we’re sure fans will be thrilled when they see what’s in store for the historic stadium.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"staying active while home

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day.

Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In  my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died. Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all.

We are entering the breeding season and last year was a very poor year for ground nesting birds, which is thought to be largely due to disturbance.ldquoSkylarks, meadow pipit and grey partridge are the key species in Musselburgh that suffer from disturbance.ldquoThe key message is lsquoareas of uncut coastal grassland may have nesting birds presentrsquo.

I suppose perseverance is the province of every wildle photographer.Finally, one sunny afternoon, Chris and I decided to go for a drive around the local fields.The road was quite narrow, and we had to pull over to let another car go past.As soon as we stopped, I opened the window and saw them ndash a good dozen hares chasing across the field.Usually, you see only one or a couple at most, so this sighting was exceptional.We parked up in haste and rushed towards the binkying hares. They were moving fast and chaotically, making it dficult to keep them in sight.One minute they were boxing and a second later they were all leaping high up. I could even see hair and saliva flying in the air ndash the field looked like it turned into a real boxing ring!As soon as the group flashed near us, I grabbed for my faithful camera and took several shots.There can be some confusion about whether or not the lsquoboxingrsquo hares are fighting, and whether this is an act between two malesor a male and female .This frantic behaviour usually occurs when a surge of testosterone pushes a buck to chase after his chosen doe across the fields in an attempt to mate.A doe can be chased by multiple bucks throughout the spring, which can understandably become a bit tiresome.This is when a female would turn around and fight a male off by initiating the boxing match. It is not unusual to see fur flying.It is believed that brown hares have lived in the UK since Roman times but are now considered naturalised.Their distinctive long, black-tipped ears and fast running make them easily distinguishable from rabbits.They are also much bigger and do not dig burrows.Hares live above ground in the open and dig lsquoformsrsquo: shallow depressions in the ground or grass.They can easily sink in the forms and blend in with the environment but, when disturbed, they take off and bound across the fields, often in a zigzag pattern.Brown hares can reach a speed of  miles per hour, which makes them Britainrsquos fastest land animal.Unlike many other British mammals, hares do not hibernate or store fat, so they need a constant food supply. They feed on a iety of grasses, herbs, twigs and bark to stay healthy.March and April are the best months to watch brown hares boxing, so I would like to encourage everyone to visit the local fields.Keep your eyes peeled for the hares and stay safe!www.facebook zanslens www.instagram zans_lens www zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"incredibly-disappointing-cancel-haddington-show-say-organisers","story":"The show, one of East Lothianrsquos most popular annual events, had been due to take place on June .However, for the second consecutive year, the committee of the United East Lothian Agricultural Societyhas made the dficult choice to not go ahead with the event.Alan Thomson, UELAS chairman, was disappointed to see the show again shelved due to coronavirus restrictions.However, he stressed that the safety of everyone involved was critical and it was not a decision taken lightly.In a statement, he said: ldquoCurrent Scottish Government guidelines suggest it would be almost impossible to run the event, which would usually attract a sea of competitors, trade stands, and visitors, from many dferent areas of Scotland and the north of England.ldquoThe safety of all our stakeholders is of paramount importance and, as such, we felt it was too great a risk to allow the show to take place this year.ldquoThe committee have already invested much time into the advance planning and organising of the event however, we all decided it would be in the best interests of the society to cancel now, rather than continue and risk costing the society money the longevity of UELAS is of utmost importance to us all.And he added: ldquoBeing forced to cancel our show for the second consecutive year is incredibly disappointing and we know how many people were looking forward to their annual visit to East Fortune.ldquoAlong with many others, we devote a great deal of time and have a huge emotional attachment to the show, so cancelling was certainly not a decision taken lightly.ldquoPlease take care of yourselves and your loved ones.

The parking is the major issue and there is already double the number of residential properties in the town centre than parking spaces, so to create even more is just unacceptable in my mind.However, Dunbar community councillor Jacquie Bell, who said that the community council backed the application, described the decision as lsquodisappointingrsquo.She told the committee that the community council had been concerned about the future of the building for a long time.She said: ldquoWe do support the proposals and welcome the reduction in units.

It stemmed from childhood holidays there, and an artist mother who was \"mad about Italian\", he says. \"When we were kids, we grew up on her cooking from lots of Italian cookbooks.\"The London-born chef gets almost misty-eyed when talking about past meals in Italy - particularly the first time he tasted spaghetti alle vongole .He has a particular obsession with the Italian deli, confessing hes \"an obsessive shopper - I will go to a particular shop to buy one item, and Ill probably buy three dferent jars of passata\", who often comes home laden with anchovies, olive oil and as much cured meat as he can carry.\"I would say I havent got an Italian bone in my body, but I have an Italian soul,\" Randall muses - and he suggests we could all learn a lot about the countrys approach to food.\"Its about keeping things really simple and not overeating,\" he explains. \"Less is more - sometimes a really delicious plate of pasta is all you need, or maybe its a baked dish or a risotto -thats done really, really well, it doesnt have to have  ingredients in it. It could just be courgettes, butter, parmesan and some fresh basil.\"Randall champions the Italian way of \"frugal cooking\" too. \"Its making use of what youve got, rather than going out and buying things that are completely out of season, or making things too elaborate,\" he explains.\"I think were quite wasteful in lots of ways: people go to the supermarket, theyll do their shop and buy lots and lots of stuff. Theyll put it in the fridge, itll be in some sort of cellophane wrap, and about four or five days later, they realise they bought this asparagus and its gone off, so they just throw it away.\"When it comes to Italian food, the biggest mistake we could be making is usually with pasta. \"I think this is where we go wrong: we cook so much pasta that you end up having this huge bowl of pasta and you sit in front of the TV, then you go back for a second portion, and then about  minutes later youre lying on the sofa thinking, Oh my God, my stomach is about to explode because Ive eaten so much carbohydrates,\" Randall says with a moan.This is incredibly easy to do, particularly as most of us can whip up a pan of pasta with our eyes closed - and thats exactly what Randall wants us to avoid. \"We do things automatically, we become like robots and cook things and we have our own ways of doing things,\" he says. \"I think we need to open our eyes and look at Italian produce, and see whats out there and whats available.\"The chef thinks we should all be chasing that feeling of \"having something where youre literally licking the bowl and thinking, God, I wish I cooked more, but  minutes later youre actually fine, because youve digested\", he says.Good quality ingredients can help you get this feeling, which is why Randall has written a cookbook dedicated to the Italian deli. \"I think food has a personality, its very important that there is a story behind some of these things,\" he explains - and talking to experts in a deli can help uncover these stories and give genius tips for the kitchen. Little tweaks to classic meals can make a huge dference: Randall recommends cooking dried pasta two or three minutes less than the packet says, and adding some pasta water to the sauce for extra flavour.Immersing yourself in Italian food beyond a bowl of pesto pasta could help you out of your lockdown cooking rut: as Randall says, its \"very versatile, the kind of food you dont really ever get bored of\".Randall certainly hasnt got bored of Italian food in lockdown, and it doesnt look like he will any time soon. Anyone familiar with the cuisine will know its all about family big bowls of pasta and trays of pizza to be shared with your loved ones. Randalls son and daughter, Max and Lola, have even managed to inherit some of his Italian soul, with the chef exclaiming: \"Maxs love of pasta is almost equal mine!\"The Italian Deli Cookbook by Theo Randall, photography by Lizzie Mayson, is published by Quadrille, priced pound.

Not least because it will be a standing reminder of the controversy surrounding her governmentrsquos handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond.Opposition MSPs on a Holyrood committee combined to declare that she had misled them. However, she was cleared by an official inquiry of breaching the Ministerial code and she comfortably won a confidence motion.:BRIAN TAYLOR:This is not a civil war in the SNP. This is more vicious and more visceralEarlier this week, SNP strategists were quietly hopeful that the worst of this issue was behind them. Ms Sturgeon must now hope that the momentum of an election campaign itself will subsume her former friendrsquos appeal.And so begins the first socially distanced election. The cynics among you may say that most people will find little trouble in staying far away from canvassing politicians. But, still, this contest really counts.Consider the cataclysmic changes since this Holyrood Parliament was elected in . Firstly, Brexit. The SNP will build upon that, but cautiously.They will recall that Scotland voted to remain in the EU and will argue that departure strengthens the case for independence. But, perhaps understandably, there will be few specics at this stage as to how and when Scotland would recreate links with Brussels.Secondly, the hideous plague. Self-evidently, the pandemic is the backdrop to the entire contest.Anecdotally, it would appear to be the received view that Nicola Sturgeon has worked tirelessly, although understandably Opposition parties will point to flaws.But what about broader strategy  The SNP will seek to build a post-pandemic economic and social consensus that ldquoScotlandrsquos recovery should be in Scotlandrsquos hands.That is couched to offend as few as possible. It most certainly includes the prospect of independence but does not explicitly rule out other devolved options, at least in the interim.In essence, it is a single transferable message: appealing to the underlying patriotic mood which created the SNP in the first place but also brought devolution into being.Of course, there is an added dimension. Most Nationalist speakers delivering their virtual stump speech will say ldquohellipin Scotlandrsquos hands, and not Boris Johnsonrsquos.They will seek to posit the Prime Minister as an external threat to Scotlandrsquos well-being, as antithetical to the Scottish perspective.Look at the four per cent pay offer to NHS staff in Scotland. SNP Ministers reckon that is genuinely merited and in keeping with the Scottish outlook. But it also helps that it is in contradistinction to the relative parsimony of the UK Government offer.It is also of course designed to quell Labour complaints, as is the move to take Scotrail into public ownership. Stand by for more universalism in the SNP manesto.The Conservative objective will be, as it was in , to corral supporters of the Union into voting Tory. They will depict their rivals as weak and vacillating, specically with regards to the prospect of a further independence referendum.Why then, you might ask, does Boris Johnson not pre-empt the issue by insisting that he will veto a referendum in any circumstances Because, of course, that would undermine the core of the Scottish Conservative campaign. They mean to depict the SNP as zealous fanatics, intent on independence, no matter what.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Alex Salmond launches pro-independence Alba Party ahead of Scottish election\",\"description\": \"Alex Salmond launches pro-independence Alba Party ahead of Scottish election\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media vRZxBmNB poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests vRZxBmNB.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": They plan to argue, further, that the only way to stop indyref is to prevent the SNP from gaining a majority at Holyrood. And they offer themselves as the ones to provide that obstacle, partly by depicting the SNP as ided, citing Alex Salmondrsquos latest initiative.More generally, an edict delivered by the PM would tend to reinforce the SNP message of external interference in Scotlandrsquos affairs. Douglas Ross knows that, especially in Holyrood elections, the voters want politicians to stand up for themselves and to stand up for Scotland.However, the Tories will say the best way to reinforce those Scottish interests is to use what they call the ldquobroad shoulders of the UK to rebuild the economy. Hence announcements such as the transition deal for North Sea oil.Labourrsquos new leader Anas Sarwar has three big challenges ahead. He too wants to thwart an overall SNP majority. But he wants to overhaul the Tories and regain second place.More generally, he wants to reverse a dismal Labour record. The party has slipped back in popular fortune at every Holyrood election since the very first in , when Donald Dewar entered coalition power.Mr Sarwar wants Labour to speak with a dferent tone. Less overtly aggressive and confrontational. More in keeping with the mid-pandemic anxieties of the voters over jobs, health care and education.He is very far from being a Sturgeon cheer-leader, not least because he is standing against her in her own constituency. But he thinks the Tories got it badly wrong when they called a motion of no confidence in her over the Salmond inquiry, before she had delivered her evidence.The Liberal Democrats will try triangulation, appealing to middle Scotland. They will depict the SNP as ldquoided and incompetent while inviting voters to shun the ldquoclumsy and cruel Tories.More broadly, they hint they are happy, once again, to talk to Labour, especially about widespread reform of the UK constitution. Labour strategists downplay any such link.The Greens, too, will stress the need for post-pandemic recovery, but will argue for a transformed economy, with a focus upon renewable energy and public transport.

According to Professor Curtice, Mr Salmondrsquos sunny predictions of a pro-independence supermajority could turn to ashes on election day. Unless Albarsquos candidates secure a sufficient percentage of votes in the constituency lists their efforts may deprive the SNP of the handful of these they require to gain an overall majority.This of course, will rest on Mr Salmondrsquos personal popularity rather than on the attributes of Albarsquos other candidates. With every fresh vicissitude the former first minister of Scotlandrsquos sense of self-worth seems to swell. In similar circumstance most others would slink away, thankful simply to have survived the onslaught.Read more:Why on earth would Scotland want to be part of the EU anyway Of the other senior politicians only Anas Sarwar, new leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, responded with any measure of dignity. The rest, by degrees, exhibited many of the haughty and juvenile tendencies that have alienated so many rank-and-file voters. Nicola Sturgeon ndash now the primary target of her predecessorrsquos vengeance ndash couldnrsquot resist a pathetic dig at Mr Salmondrsquos perceived gambling habits. The partyrsquos Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, described Kenny MacAskill ndash the highest profile SNP defector to the new party ndash as ldquoan embarrassment.Mr Blackford, a nasty and vindictive politician, is still remembered across the political spectrum for the callous nature of his campaign against the tragic former Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy. Recently, he was forced to apologise for attempting to inflict mob justice on an innocent freelance photographer for breaching travel restrictions . At Westminster, Mr Blackford presided over meetings of his group which were barely-disguised, psychological ambushes to bring down his colleague, Joanna Cherry. One of these figures is indeed an embarrassment and itrsquos not Mr MacAskill.The nature of Mr Blackfordrsquos response encapsulates several of the reasons for Mr Salmondrsquos optimism. He and his senior colleagues have presided over the SNPrsquos transitioning from a party that exuded openness and bonhomie to one now characterised by authoritarianism and mind-control and built around the cult of their leader.Thus, the foot-soldiers of the wider Yes movement, those who turn up in all weathers to march under one banner for independence have lately felt a disdainful chill coming from those who gather around the SNP leadership. These people have felt betrayed and only too aware of how they are routinely portrayed by those using the Hate Crime Bill and gender theory to marginalise them. The suspicion persists among many of them that these ideological proclamations are convenient fig-leafs to cover the SNPrsquos failure to improve the le-chances of Scotlandrsquos poorest communities.Contempt for those who may be tempted to back Alba was apparent too in much of the media commentary. One writer dismissed all those thousands who have already pledged allegiance to the new party as ldquocranks, misfits and zoomers, these being the favoured slurs of middle-class commentators to dismiss anything they consider too rough to be worthy of actual engagement.Read more:Whats the SNPs problem with the working class Another idea thatrsquos taken root among the cafeacute politicos is that by playing more than one pro-independence team in the contest nationalists are ldquoGaming Democracy. Basically, this suggests that cornering the market in list seats as well as first-past-the-post ones is just not cricket, old boy, and undermines the spirit of the contest. Behave yourself.Democracy itself is the gaming of equality. Itrsquos how civilised, educated and opulent people mask the class-driven and unseen levers that still pull in their direction. You might think we exist in a state of one-person one-vote equality but the multi-billion-pound lobbying sector the adoption of neo-liberal power structures and the paths of least resistance always taken by politicians who promised to be radical indicate something . Boris Johnson dropped the pretence last week when he lauded the corporate \"greed\" thatrsquos apparently rescued us from the pandemic.The SNP leadershiprsquos fury at Mr Salmondrsquos re-emergence after hersquod been presumed permanently deleted should be viewed in the context of gravy trains being de-railed and comfortable lestyles jeopardised.

These might carry more integritythey didnrsquot come from an organisation which has consistently ignored complaints from female members who have been threatened with sexual violence by known ndash and protected ndash party activists.Similarly, the accusations that Mr Salmond is threatening unity to satisfy his own ego-driven thirst for revenge. What unity  The parliamentary SNP has become a haven for preening, elitist performance artists while locking out working class people. It exists as a career opportunity for a cadre of mediocre middle-management types who gather to congratulate and affirm each other in issuing risk-free political emoluments. From time to time they pause, but only to abjure the thick proles for not being sophisticated enough to get on board with the progressiveness.We may all be entitled to take a certain view of Mr Salmondrsquos past conduct and his actual reasons for leading the Alba Party, but spare me the sanctimony and hypocrisy. Nicola Sturgeon, Ian Blackford and their parliamentary drones have fostered more ision in the SNP than anything that might be wrought by Mr Salmond. A generation of unbroken and unchallenged power has made them arrogant and self-indulgent. They have effectively established a party within a party and a platinum card membersrsquo lounge where access is granted only to a favoured few who are word-perfect in the leaderrsquos little red book of approved word and phrases.If Alex Salmond and Alba do damage the prospects of an overall Yes majority Nicola Sturgeon will only have herself to blame.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

You wonrsquot know just how fearful farmers are about this until you see the results of a devastating dog attack on livestock hellip it can be horric.With sunshine forecast across the country from Friday, the masses are gearing up for a great big green escape to the countryside. But therersquos a major change this spring and that has been the explosion of new dogs over the last year which are about to be unleashed for the first time.Glancing down at my familyrsquos rough-coated Jack Russell terrier gnawing loudly on a Nylabone chew at my feet, I realise what a salvation our furry canine friends have been during this dficult time but am equally struck by the enormity of responsibility which comes with owning a dog and the training involved.My hat goes off to new dog owners who have invested in online training classes over the last year, but in the coming weeks, for many, it will be the first time their dogs will be let off the lead in an open space ndash putting their recall training into practice. That open space is likely to be on farmland, and our fields are quickly filling up with new-born lambs as farmers and crofters embark on one of their busiest seasons of the year.  Right to roam is a wonderful thing, but with unfettered access to the countryside, comes the duty of responsible access. So, in short, keep your dog on a lead around livestock and be wary of ground nesting birds and other wildle.This might seem mind-numbingly obvious to most reading this column, but the fact is, there are more than . million households in the UK who have brought a new pet into their families since the start of this pandemic. This includes a lot of new dog owners who may not be aware of the devastating consequences their cute fluffy pet could have on new-born lambs.I will never stop reminding people about the fact that any dog has the capacity to chase, maim and kill livestock, as every day I am confronted with painful stories and devastating images of farmers who have suffered the horric consequences of an out-of-control dog savaging their sheep.This past week, South of Scotland MSP Emma Harper received unanimous support for a Bill which sought to toughen the penalties on offer to the courts when convicting irresponsible dog owners involved in livestock attacks. Now, guilty iniduals could serve up to  months in jail and or a fine of up to pound,. For years, farming organisations and the police have been running educational campaigns warning dog owners of the consequences loose dogs can have on livestock, but now this new Bill will add further weight and deterrence.Since I started my job with the Scottish Farmer in , I have supported Emma Harper with her proposals and have followed her journey as she met up with farmers across the country, listening to their concerns and promising to bring them justice, so I felt a huge rush of emotion on Wednesday night when this Bill was debated for the third and final time in Holyrood and will now proceed for royal assent before passing into law in six monthsrsquo time.This is a huge moment for Scottish farming and offers much hope for the future that these incidents are being recognised and will be dealt with more fairly. The whole industry is indebted to Emma Harper and her team who have campaigned unreservedly on this over the past four years and these tough new penalties will hopefully send a strong reminder to dog owners of what is at stake,their dog chases or kills livestock. Keeping your dog on a lead around livestock isnrsquot the only thing that should be a no-brainer, but so should picking up your dog poo. This isnrsquot just a responsibility reserved for walking on our beaches or our streets, but also in our fields.Neosporosis is one of the hidden diseases which can be carried in dog faeces and poses a serious risk to livestock and other dogs. More dogs are being infected by the parasite neospora as a result of the growing trend for feeding dogs raw meat. The parasite sheds eggs passing out in dogsrsquo poo andleft behind in a field, can remain infectious for up to six months. If consumed by cattle, in contaminated water, grass or in hay this disease can cause abortions and is responsible for more than  per cent of abortions in cattle.I spoke to a local farmer from Ayrshire this weekend who told me that  acres of one of his silage fields was so saturated by dog poo that he was unable to use it to feed his cattle this winter. He had to accept that  bales ndash equating to around pound, ndash had to be discarded. He told me that despite there being a woodland running alongside the field with a route for dog walkers, that the public preferred to walk through his field and were oblivious to what their dogs leave behind. He is rightfully worried, that from this Friday, the hordes are about to descend, and his field will be ruined once again, and his livestock put at risk.We all should exercise our right to enjoy our beautul countryside, but be mindful of whose workplace you are passing through, and afford it the same respect you would ask for in ."},{"url":null,"title":"send-clowns-short-story-nick-scobie","story":"SEND IN THE CLOWNS, BY NICK SCOBIEChief Inspector Aitken vowed as he left Ashfield Square that the next time he confronted one of Joe Smiths rallies he would ldquo crush him. The police had been heavily criticised on all the news channels for failing to keep order. He wanted revenge. At the Anti- Poverty Rally organised by community activist Joe, black-clad anarchists had suddenly appeared and sparked a mini-riot.Joe Smith had secured a job as a hospital porter in Chloes Hospital in addition to his usual job as a joiner so that he could spend extra time with Chloe. She was  years of age but had leukeumia. He knew and she knew that she was very ill. He had discovered that Chloe was able to analyse everyday political events. He felt he benefited from her views. She was confrontational and feisty ndash just like her mother.ldquoDaddy ndash why cant people protest peacefully  \" asked Chloe as Joe sat beside her on a visitor`s chair one night. ldquoWhy cant you take the clowns with you when you want to say what you think is wrong  People listen to clowns.\" Joe left the hospital ward and thought about what Chloe had said. He and his friends often dressed up as clowns to raise funds for Chloes ward.Joe thought long and hard about what Chloe had said. He had an ideahellip..ldquoMy Daddy is a clown ldquo said Chloe to the ward sister ndash Sarah Burt ndash a few days later. ldquoAnd he is going to help the working class. No-one is better than anyone . And my Daddy is a clown who is going to do something about it.\" Sister Burt sighed inwardly and thought to herself: ldquoWhat is this child talking about  \"On Saturday  November  history was made.  police officers sat in expectation of a ldquo ruck at Ashfield Square. Joe Smith had organised an Anti-Poverty Rally and thousands were expected to attend. A helicopter buzzed overhead, while the police support units were on standby. Chief Inspector Aitken could barely conceal his excitement. That toe rag Joe Smith was going to get his just desserts.Chief Inspector Aitken radioed over to his ldquospotter ldquo in plain clothes around  noon on the Saturday. The rally was due to start at pm. In Ashfield Square there were very few people about but the spotter Sergeant Combes, in plainclothes, had advised him that crowds were gathering at the Ashfield City Football Stadium, half a mile from Ashfield Square. He suspected that they were going to all rally there before marching down to the Square. An hour later he confirmed that there was a crowd of around  but that they appeared to be enjoying a pop and rock concert and a circus. ldquoA circus  \", queried Chief Inspector Aitken. ldquo Yes, Governor,\" replied Combes.The crowd in the Ashfield City Stadium enjoyed the music and the circus. The clowns were a particular favourite. Everyone was having a good time apart from  or so black-clad anarchists.Chief Inspector Aitken was getting more and more bemused as it was now .pm and there was no sign of the crowd moving out of the stadium. Then a minute later his radio crackled into le and Sergeant Combes said, ldquoFour Hells Angels on Harley-Davidsons have arrived in the stadium.\" Five minutes later Combes radioed in to say: ldquo The bikers are on their way to you Governor, but I think I should warn you about something.\" ldquoNot now, Combes,\" barked Aitken, ldquoI am in command mode now.\"The police surrounding Ashfield Square braced themselves ready for action as four Harley-Davidsons thundered into the Square itself. The bikes stopped and from the back of each one, a clown alighted carrying a case. The clowns waved off the bikers who promptly left the Square. The police watched in astonishment as the clowns slowly unpacked their cases and then set up a table and four chairs. Then they all sat down and set out tea cups, a tea pot and cakes. The clowns poured themselves tea and chatted away to each other.ldquoWhat do we do now, sir \" asked CI Aitkens second in command Inspector Brian Donnelly. ldquoWe wait,\" said Aitken confidently. ldquoObviously this is meant to lull us into a  sense of security. Smith and his rabble will be here enough soon enough.\" An hour later, Aitken was about to have a coronary. The huge crowd was still up in the Stadium peacefully enjoying themselves while he was facing a table load of four clowns drinking tea.Eventually he snapped. ldquoDonnelly ndash arrest those four\", he shouted. ldquoOn what charge sir \" queried Donnelly. ldquoClowning around,\" yelled Aitken. ldquoAnd wasting police timehellip.anything you can think ofhellipAs each clown was led away in handcuffs by about six officers each, they showed clearly to the waiting news cameras the slogan on their chests ndash ldquoChloes Clown Army Says No To PovertyldquoChloes Clown Army  \" asked John Butler, Sky duty news editor, as he watched the first pictures coming in of the events at Ashfield. His news crew had been sent up to report on a possibly hostile Anti-Poverty Rally, but it was not expected to be very newsworthy. Now he was intrigued. His reporter on the ground went up to the stadium and reported back to him.John Butler immediately ordered his Six OClock News Team to work on the background to the story. Meanwhile in Ashfield Central Police Station Joe Smith and his fellow three clowns sat in separate cells and slowly smiled to themselves. CI Aitken had been in to tell them that they were all in very hot water and he expected the CPS to throw the book at them. Which was not the view of his  junior officers as they went off duty wondering why they had been told to expect a riot that afternoon.ldquoCan I watch the news on television, Sister  \" asked Chloe at around . that afternoon. ldquoOh wel,lyou must Chloe,\" replied Sister Burt. The TV was switched over to Sky and at pm the main news came on. Sister Burt nearly had a canary when Chloe shrieked ldquo Thats my Daddy !\" Sister Burt turned to see a report coming in from Ashfield Stadium and Square. There were shots of the crowd in the stadium, clowns on motorbikes, clowns having tea in the Square and then finally clowns being arrested.As she listened in she heard interviews outlining the iniquities of poverty. Members of Joe Smiths committee outlined how they had been determined to have a peaceful rally, so had deliberately kept the main crowd entertained in the Stadiumand gone for a thought provoking, very quiet event in the Square. And then one spokesman delivered his main punchline. \"We cannot thank Chloe Smith enough for inspiring us to Send In The Clowns.\" Sister Burts face was a picture. ldquoI told you my Daddy was a clown, said Chloe proudly.Well ndash the story hit the internet and soon went viral. The pictures of riot police arresting four clowns having a tea party resonated around the world. Joe Smith and his three fellow clowns were released on the Sunday morning after the Home Secretary intervened and demanded to know from the Chief Constable of Ashfield whether it was his intention to make the British Police the laughing stock of the world. CI Aitken was put on immediate sick leavehellip.And as for Chloe   Well, as you read this she is still very ill in hospital, and only time will tell. But her request to her Daddy to ldquoSend In The Clowns\" has been vindicated.JUDGES COMMENT: Very good and topical too.

She probably saw more of him than his we.Mr Salmonds response to the character issue has been: show not tell. Albas -strong candidates list today has a majority of women. It includes two leading feminist SNP defectors: Dumbarton councillor Caroline McAllister, and North Lanarkshire councillor, Lynne Anderson. They were recently elected as the SNPs Womens Convener and Equalities Convener respectively. Anyway you look at it, that is a remarkable coup.Read more: Hating Boris isnrsquot enough ndash this election will be dficult for the SNPThey were also signatories of the Womens Pledge on sex-based rights. Ms Sturgeons forthright promotion of trans self-ID may play well on Twitter, but many older feminists are profoundly opposed. Most voters find the idea of men becoming biologically female mystying at best. The SNP is keen to keep this policy under wraps until after the election.Gender overlaps with an age class ide that has opened up in the nationalist movement. Mr Salmonds appeal is very much to older working-class supporters of independence, rather than the managerialist elite who dominate Ms Sturgeons inner circle. Mr Salmond would have willingly led those massive independence marches in . Ms Sturgeon preferred to march with middle class Remainers in London, rather than the uncouth crowd in Edinburgh with their motorbikes and Wallace kitsch.At an Edinburgh Book Festival event, Ms Sturgeon even suggested changing the name of the SNP because she didnt like being tainted with the N-word. She hates being called a ldquonationalist. Mr Salmond accepts it. It is what it is. He still accepts the recruitment of boxer Alex Arthur, who is a star in Scotlands housing estates, but only known on social media for his offensive remarks about Romanians.The SNP and many commentators have portrayed Mr Salmond as a right-wing, Nigel Farage-style populist leading a rag bag of racists and misfits. And truth be told, there is something of the Brexit Party in Alba. It is a nationalist party that has come from nowhere and is built around the personality of an insurgent, populist leader.The big dference is that Mr Salmond remains avowedly pro-European.Mind you, Alba doesnt seem to have settled policy on Europe. It thinks Ms Sturgeon has failed to recognise that SNP policy is redundant post-Brexit. Since Britain left the EU, the SNP has tried to pretend that nothing has changed, that the borderless  prospectus still applies. Yet everything has, and Alba is right to call out this pretence.There will obviously be a hard border with Englandand when Scotland leaves the UK and joins the European Union. More precisely, there will be a trade and regulatory ide, since the pre-existing UK Common Travel Area will mean passports and visas are unnecessary after independence. Alba sees this as an issue that has to be addressed. Though in opening this Pandoras Box, Mr Salmond could end up with more than he bargained for.A lot of SNP supporters, and Alba fellow travellers, are distinctly unenthusiastic about rejoining the European Union, and not just because of Ursula von der Leyens threats to start a vaccines trade war. There has long been a eurosceptic strand in the SNP. Many on the left favour the Norway option of joining the single market but not the political institutions of Brussels. The SNP has tried to keep a lid on this debate too, but not for much longer.Read more: Scots may loathe him, but Boris doesnrsquot give a damn about Plan BMr Salmond has also called Nicola Sturgeons bluff about a Scottish independence referendum being imminent, delivered by a new Section  order from Westminster. That is simply not going to happen. It is fancul to believe that Boris Johnson is going to risk breaking up the UK just because the SNP wins a majority in Holyrood. He will simply keep saying that now is not the time for indyref, as Britain emerges from Brexit. Sir Keir Starmer will back him to the hilt. Mind you, there is equally no guarantee that Mr Johnson would recognise an SNP-Alba supermajority. He might just echo Ms Sturgeon saying it is ldquocheating.However, this argument that having a pro-independence party standing for list seats alone is somehow undemocratic, or ldquogaming the system as Ms Sturgeon puts it, is simply wrong. The Scottish Green Party is a pro-independence party which is also standing only in list seats. As the Times reported earlier this month, the SNP leadership has been in discussions with Patrick Harvie about a formal Green-SNP coalition and even used the term ldquosupermajority to refer to their combined electoral strength.From the point of view of an ordinary SNP supporter, voting Alba for list seats is a no-lose proposition. Older working-class voters will likely see Alba as preferable to the ldquowoke Greens, whose policy on transgender issues is so controversial that their star MSP, Andy Wightman, had to leave the party because he wasnt permitted to speak about it. At any rate, SNP voters will have to be given better reasons not to vote Alba than that Mr Salmond is a bad man and that standing on the list is cheating. Ms Sturgeon may have forgotten, but only a few years ago the Scottish National Party renamed itself ldquoAlex Salmond for First Minister on list ballot papers.This man is a huge part of SNP folk memory. The attempt to write him out of history, like a nationalist Trotsky, was never going to succeed. Rather than attacking him personally Mr Sturgeon would be better advised to stay silent. Let the electoral system do its work and see what the voters deliver. After all, she is still vastly more popular among Scottish voters than Mr Salmond.

Dave Thompson, a couple of years ago, did the arithmetic and suggested a separate but linked list independence party. Some of us saw the sense and expected her to bring him in for discussion, and agree to it with some degree of SNP control, such as a common  and commitment to support the SNP for government.Had she not dismissed his idea, ldquosupermajority would be her slogan now, because an SNP-supported but separate list party would have left little electoral space for Alba to elbow into.Ms Sturgeonrsquos error of rejection arose in my view from the  belief, nurtured by the cult of personality, that she is the one and only who matters in, and to, the independence movement. As she is finding out, that it is not so.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh.SUPERMAJORITY IS A NON-STARTERALBA MP Neale Hanvey believes that in the coming election a majority of nationalist MSPs would be representative of the electoral system, not the electorate. He is right. In the  election, the SNP secured . per cent of the constituency votes and .% of the list votes on a turnout of %. Its share of the electorate was therefore only .%. Hardly a resounding mandate for independence.The same thing will happen in the  election, so the idea of a \"supermajority for independence\" is a non-starter.William Loneskie, Lauder.* IF Alex Salmond were to achieve a supermajority in the Scottish Parliament which roundly defied the balance of the wishes of the Scottish electorate, it might not ignite civil commotion but it would be a text book formula for that outcome. Perhaps Mr Salmond, from his dalliance with Russian culture, feels ready for the task of unrepresentative governance.Michael Sheridan, Glasgow.NO VISION FOR OUR FUTUREANDREW Dunlopjoins a growing list of unionist commentators fervently hoping that Alex Salmondrsquos Alba Party will derail progress towards an independent Scotland.Nowhere in the article was there a vision of Scotlandrsquos future or what radical initiatives his Conservative Party might offer Scottish voters to address problems such as inequality and child poverty. The familiar themes of stoking fear of borders and currency predominate, insinuating that the Union is forever and that now will never be the time.Baron Dunlop of Helensburgh asserts that the Alex Salmond affair has shown deficiencies in Scotlandrsquos governance. I actually agree with him on this point after Mayrsquos election an urgent reassessment of the role of the Lord Advocate and the Crown Office is required. However, when considering how Scotland is governed, I would gently remind the noble Baron that he is an active member of the largest undemocratic assembly outside of China. As a member of the House of Lords he has never been elected to the Holyrood or Westminster parliaments yet he held executive office as Under Secretary of State for Scotland for two years under David Cameron and Theresa May. I doubtBaron Dunlop sees the hypocrisy of his position on this point or the irony of his accusation that Alex Salmond is ldquogaming the election while his colleague, Douglas Ross, was attempting, and failing, to facilitate a unionist electoral pact.I fear Andrew Dunloprsquos aspirations for the Alba Party to tarnish the First Minister and take seats from the SNP are misplaced. If anything, Mr Salmonds intervention is a greater threat to unionist list seats, particularly in the six regions where the SNP have no list seats due to their large constituency vote. The days of Scotland being governed by the ennobled and the entitled are coming to an end and the activities of unelected politicians such as Andrew Dunlop are one of the main drivers of the desire to put our future in the hands of the Scottish people.Iain Gunn, Elgin.MAKE SALMOND THINK AGAINTHE US has Donald Trump , England has Boris Johnsonand now Scotland has Alex Salmond .By their own admission, all \"Men Behaving Badly\". God help us.As a long-time independence supporter, I was pleasantly surprised when Alex Salmond stepped down after the referendum in . He had had a remarkable career and had been the outstanding politician of his era despite having some fairly obvious flaws, but there were signs that he was already losing the plot and Nicola Sturgeon appeared to be the ideal successor. Apart from a lack of flexibility in the independence campaign, tying himself rigidly to the pound sterling and offering no alternative to EU membership, Mr Salmond had already lost a lot of my respect when sooking up to Rupert Murdoch, Mr Trump and royalty.However, my heart sank when he came back to the forefront as an MP, as it was clear that his ego wouldnt allow him to remain in the shadows for long. I suspect that the unholy mess the SNP has got itself into is closely connected to his continuing to interfere from the sidelines both then and after losing his seat at Westminster. Not for Mr Salmond fading out of the limelight with a cushy number somewhere while writing his memoirs and playing golf.By his own admission, his conduct has been less than honourable and I hope that his tarnished reputation will dissuade the vast majority of independence voters from supporting his new party. Sadly, history as exemplied by Messrs Trump and Johnson shows us that this is not always case. I can only hope that the Scottish electorate is more discerning and sends Mr Salmond home to think again with his tail between his legs.Gordon Evans, Glasgow.NEW PARTY IS NOT INCLUSIVECOMING from France where the National Rally gets  per cent of the vote, I have always been surprised that there was no populist far-right nationalist party in Scotland. This has probably changed with the creation of the Alba Party.The National Rally in France defines itself as economically left-wing. It believes it protects the working class, and takes pride in being socially conservative. It claims to defend the \"average Frenchman\" and \"common sense\", against the \"betrayal of inevitably corrupt elites\". This ideology is replicated across the European far right, from Lega Nord to Vox.Alba does not have any policies or a manesto, but it is clear to see where it has positioned itself already.The presence of ex- Group members, like Kenny MacAskill and Alex Salmond, shows that its leaders want to present themselves as an old-fashioned socialist party on economic matters, class reductionist and radical.Their stance on social issues is transparent too. Alba rapidly defined itself as socially conservative: Mr Salmond repeatedly used anti-LGBT terminology in his commentary about womenrsquos rights and defines his nationalism as the kind that trumps any progress on social issues. \"Get indy done\" clamoured some of his supporters a few weeks ago.Despite Mr Salmondrsquos calls for unity, Alba is miles away from the inclusive nationalism the SNP or the Greens stand for. The SNP and the Greens should stay well away from Alba.Jeacutereacutemie Fernandes, Elgin.LET US AVOID THE RANCOURWHATEVER  Alex Salmond has done, by creating a new political party he has opened up the possibility of igniting the independence argument beyond the increasingly intemperate SNP-led debate and, by so doing, giving the electorate the chance to think of independence beyond the narrow SNP-dominated focus. In this context, Scotlands printed media should also be mindful both of its language and tone and allow for all views to be fairly and accurately represented.

The drip, drip, drip of information about the views of iniduals either joining, supporting or running for Alba of late has been nauseating. One candidate made shameful comments about ldquobeggars, Romanians, HIV, and vaccines. Another called Nicola Sturgeon ldquoa cow. Itrsquos clear why many in Alba get slightly antsy at the idea of a clampdown on hate.:Salmondrsquos Trumpian circus distracts Scotland from the issues which matterWe already know Alba has the support of convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan, and includes some of the most reactionary voices from the SNP now within its ranks, including defecting MP Neal Hanvey, once suspended for using anti-semitic language. Nor can it be overlooked that when it comes to Alex Salmond, as Sturgeon has said, there are ldquosignicant questions about the appropriateness of histo public office given the concerns that have been raised about his behaviour previously.Sturgeon also says shersquoll refuse to have any dealings with Salmond as hersquos not shown any ldquosign of acknowledging how people feel about how he behaved while he was First Minister. Alba has already been dubbed, somewhat grotesquely, ldquothe Sleepy Cuddle Party. Creepiness abounds.The catalogue of unpleasant stories about Alba is too long for the purposes of this column, but put simply, this isnrsquot a basket of deplorables, itrsquos a whole supermarket trolley full. Yet perhaps the most galling of all Albarsquos antics is the fact that some of its supporters not only have a history of peddling the most disgusting, intimidating hate in Scotland, they continue to do so despite Salmond vowing at the launch of the party that its campaigning would be ldquoentirely positive.Hersquos clearly wrong. To pile duplicity on top of hypocrisy and offence, there are many voices across the Yes movement ndash mostly the older, more socially conservative wing ndash who persist in their ldquoWheesht for indy nonsense despite the truth about Alba staring them in the face.The sheer audacity is breath-taking. I donrsquot speak for the SNP ndash far from it ndash but Alba supporters have monstered the SNP, and in particular Sturgeon, endlessly for month upon month. They, and others, now want the SNP to play nice  Grow up.Itrsquos said that attacking Alba undermines the cause of independence. What have todayrsquos Alba supporters been doing for years now  Attacking everyone in sight. If theyrsquod learned to persuade instead of hate after , support for independence would be well beyond %, one imagines.Itrsquos downright gaslighting, which is no surprise really given the party in question and some of its supportersrsquo attitudes to women. These are the same people who claim Sturgeon is entirely to blame for the rise of Alba and should cosy up to Salmond. Get your head around that oneyou can without tripping over the word lsquomisogynyrsquo.But forget the SNP. There are much bigger questions around this Wheesht for Indy gang and their negative effect on the Yes movement.Whatrsquos the purpose of politics  Clearly to win people to your side. How on Earth are any soft, moderate, undecided voters going to be won over by a movement too sleekit to call out whatrsquos wrong within its own ranks Among the conspiratorial, paranoid wing of the Yes movement therersquos a fondness for the slightly menacing phrase ldquowe see you when they think therersquos some ldquotraitor, ldquoplant or ldquoquisling around. Well, be sure, the Scottish people see what this Wheesht for Indy crowd is up to: theyrsquore trying to hide dirt under the carpet. It looks crafty, manipulative, and amoral. Theyrsquore passively accepting the unacceptable because it suits their political ends. There can be nothing more damaging to independence. Be honest and yoursquoll win respect and votes.Unionists, understandably, look on this spectacle with glee. The Yes movement is tearing itself apart, in whatrsquos essentially a culture war between progressive social democrats in the SNP and Greens, and the agglomeration of Albarsquos alt-nat and alt-right voices, riddled with conspiracy theories, disinformation and paranoia. The Holyrood election is now mired in the madness that Alba brought in its wake. The vote in May, which should be about policy, has become a circus. On the issue of independence, sane voices are crowded out by extremists. And yet the Wheesht for Indy mob seem to be okay with this. Theyrsquore either politically immature or on the road to radicalisation themselves. This can only benefit the No supporting parties.If the behaviour of Alba figures isnrsquot strongly called out, itrsquoll send Scotland on a dangerous path. We cannot simply stumble into a place where we normalise the attitudes and behaviour this party represents. It masquerades as left-wing, for instance, while acting as a vehicle for some deeply reactionary characters.The defence of boxer Alex Arthur ndash whorsquos standing for the party and made some appalling comments online ndash is a case in point. Wersquore told hersquos just a working class lad and thatrsquos how working class people act. As someone from the working class, unlike many phonies who claim to speak for ordinary folk, let me be clear: this isnrsquot how working class people typically behave, and saying so is about as left as Enoch Powell.The American right normalised the antics of Trump and the lunatics who jumped on board his iteration of Republicanism. They did so because it was politically expedient. Look where that led and what that did. It ended up eating them alive. Thatrsquos what will happen here unless people have the gumption and decency to simply say what they see in front of them.:The Yes movement has been corrupted by hate and conspiracyIndependence is meaningless unless it builds a better Scotland.

Sarah Smith introduced the Alba Party for some reason, wasting important inclusion from the audience and allowed Douglas Ross to bully other participants when speaking.Today listening to Good Morning Scotland on Radio Scotlandthe BBC appeared to indicate it has become the pro-Union voice. Reporters and news segments continually repeated the \"another independence referendum\" rhetoric at every opportunity. If the number of times the debate participants and GMS presenters mentioned independence is counted it would prove the BBC participation in Unionist messaging, restricting debate on other topics. Why have a political debate when the BBC reporters and presenters are doing the job of the unionist parties  Why are they not similarly holding the unionist parties to account  Why are we not hearing of the parties vision for a future prosperous Scotland  That is what voters want to hear.Anti-independence voices are being given an unfair amount of time to make their case there should be a balance. If the BBC is facilitating the debate to be about independence then both sides should be given equal time to make their arguments.Christine Smith, Troon.* HAVING just watched the leaders debate, I have come to recognise how just how important the issue of a referendum on Scottish independence is in the world of Scottish unionist politics.While the programmersquos questions covered a range of issues, it was the prospect of a referendum that was given overwhelming importance, as Douglas Rossrsquos repeated references made clear. Without it he would have had to explain Conservative policies on climate change, the economy, education, condemning abusive attacks on MSPs et al. Thankfully for him, the partyrsquos obsession with a second independence referendum got him out of having to do so.TJ Dowds, Cumbernauld.* THE first Scottish leaders debate was rather a dull affair, presented by the unionist BBC featuring questions mostly about indyref. Only the women stood out, with a spirited performance from Lorna Slater and a controlled and competent one from Nicola Sturgeon. Douglas Ross was a disaster with his endless diatribe against independence, which Anas Sarwar and Willie Rennie tried to counter. As to the question of Union or independence, facts and figures may be discussed, but with conflicting views, littered with deceit and lies, a fair conclusion is dficult.However one question is now clear. If a supposedly highly-subsidised Scotland is such a burden to the UK, why is Westminster so desperate to keep us in the Union  The answer is that apparently poor, wee Scotland holds the majority of the UKs energy resources, including lucrative food and drink exports and has the talent and ability to manage all.Indeed Scotland is certainly \"big enough, rich enough and smart enough\" to prosper as a fully independent country again and make no mistake, Westminster is very well aware of this as they would miss our financial contribution massively.Grant Frazer, Newtonmore.* NICOLA Sturgeons below-par performance at the leaders debate was promulgated by two factors. Fourteen years of the SNP in power leaves little wriggle room to cover up all the mistakes, and independence is definitely not the flavour of the month. Alex Salmonds intervention has been the final straw in what was already going to be a hard policy to sell.The public are genuinely fed up with stre. They are getting enough of it from nature without some politicians adding to it. This election could yet prove to be a bridge too far for those seeking independence.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.AUSTERITY ON BOOSTERS BECKONSTHANK you for your coverage of the Institute for Fiscal Studies report on Scotlands public expenditure , especially in the light of the approaching election.It comes as a timely reminder that every time Nicola Sturgeon opens her mouth to brag of past achievements or to commit to new expenditure, voters should remember that much of it would be impossible without revenues redistributed from better-off parts of the UK. Furthermore, in Mondays leaders debate, Ms Sturgeon pledged the SNP to Scotlands rejoining the EU in the next five years. Not only does this require a referendum on independence within the sort of reckless timescale favoured by Ian Blackford, but it would demand that Scotlands public expenditure is permanently slashed to meet the requirements of the EU Stability and Growth Pact.When these are added together, it is clear that to vote for the SNP is to wave goodbye to the devolution goodies and to say hello to austerity on boosters.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.DONT BLAME IT ALL ON STURGEONI THOUGHT Jim Sillarss roots were somewhere in Ayrshire and not Mars .Is he not aware that there is another independence-supporting party which has been successfully garnering list seats and, while supporting independence, has proven to be no patsy for the SNP  I refer, of course to the Greens.Nicola Sturgeon was right to dismiss the idea of an SNP ldquoreserves party being formed to capture the list vote and ldquogame the system. Does Mr Sillars take the electorate for mugs  They would have seen this for the cynical ploy it would have been and, I suspect, many soft independence voters would have been repulsed by this anti-democratic gerrymandering.I am under no illusions that it is ldquoSaint Nicola who leads the SNP but when will this group of predominantly white, middle-agedmen stop blaming the current situation on her and face up to the fact thatit were not for the inappropriate behaviour of their leader we would not be in this situation and would be striding forward to independence, dignity intact Itrsquos not proud Edwardrsquos army that needs to be sent homeward to think again. Itrsquos Eckrsquos battalion who need to get a flea in their ear.William Thomson, Denny.HONEST APPROACH WILL WIN OUTI AM sad to say that the respect in which I held Jim Sillars has been somewhat tarnished over recent years, however, I was unprepared for his rather seedy suggestion that Nicola Sturgeon should have agreed to the establishing of a \"separate but linked list independence party\" which would have had \"some degree of SNP control\" basically, a pop-up party designed to beat the Holyrood system.Ms Sturgeon has stated that \"weve got to win independence fair and square. We cant game or cheat our way to that\". I think that the First Ministers straight talking and honest approach will be the one which will resonate with the voters in May.Ruth Marr, Stirling.* I DONrsquoT want Jim Sillars to shut up, heaven forfend, Scottish politics has been very much poorer since he faded into the background, but I do wish he would put up. Despite Ian Blackfordrsquos childish remark, a jibe that was more suited to himself, Alba already has a very able, established voice in Kenny MacAskill, butMr Sillars committed himself to the new party it would add greatly to its standing.Meg Henderson, Montrose.WHY ARE THERE NO PROXY VOTES I HAVE two grown-up sons currently working abroad.They recently asked me to contact the Electoral Registration Office in Glasgow, to arrange a proxy vote for them in the forthcoming Scottish election. Both are registered to vote in Scotland.I contacted the office and was informed that UK citizens living in Scotland had no right to a proxy vote in Scottish elections. This right only applies in Westminster elections.Like many others, I recently received the Scottish Governmentrsquos pamphlet, entitled ldquoYour Scottish Parliament election voting guide. On Page  it states: \"British citizens living overseas canrsquot vote in the Scottish Parliament election.Notwithstanding this exclusion, there are a number of other groups who are allowed to vote, including, again on Page , \"a qualied foreign national who has permission to enter or remain in the UK, or who does not need such permission\".It is my submission that those who, like my two sons, are working abroad, have retained their UK domicile. However, for whatever reason, they have been disenfranchised by being denied their right to set up a proxy vote.Historically people have always had to fight hard for the right to vote. It is to be hoped that whichever party forms the government after the May election will rescind such discriminatory legislation as a matter of urgency.Kathryn A Carroll, Glasgow.Read more: Sturgeon only has herself to blame for arrival of Alba"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-letting-youngsters-learn-play-age-seven-bring-great-benefits","story":"During the postponement of full-time education owing to the pandemic over the last year, there was plenty of time to recalibrate our countrys education system to restore its credibility.

It is evidently not sufficient to presume that staff in general hospitals will have specialist infectious disease training nor that these hospitals will be suitable for treating rampant infections.Whatever, this pandemic has shown up the weakness in our current NHS system and the need to urgently review how infectious diseases are treated and contained.This must include facilities separated from our unsuitable existing general hospitalsboth staff and patients are to be kept safe.Elizabeth Marshall, Edinburgh.LETS LOSE THE REALISMDAVID Clarkaskshe is alone in deploring the lack of speech clarity arising from the adoption by broadcast media of \"realistic\" dialogue in place of the clear \"stage speech\" which used to allow viewers to follow the plot without dficulty.

Most radio output I now also switch off because of the muttering and the present use of those higher-pitched \"little girl\" voices that presenters announcers actors, and the other females who inhabit the radio waves have to use, so over to Radio  I go where music does not \"mutter\".

Last month, the council’s interim chief executive offered an unreserved apology after an investigation found that the order had failed to adhere to procurement policies.But in a true twist of fate, the authority#s calamity could now generate more than its weight in stone for the local economy, according to archaeologists.#This is a very rare and unique find,# said Dr Avril Foulis, an archaeological consultant from the Friends of Orkney Lithology Society.#The figurine is in near-perfect condition, despite being approximately , years old, and having travelled the -mile journey to Orkney within the stone shipment.#This could present a breakthrough opportunity for Orkney archaeologists and the tourism industry alike. If we take the right steps, it could bring in millions of pounds in academic funding as well as additional footfall from visitors. This could be just the post-pandemic boost Orkney needs.#Dr Foulis and her colleagues believe the find could be just the first of many to come.#We have assembled a team to examine and oversee the remainder of the stone which is being shipped from Oban,# she continued.#If there are any more discoveries to be made, we hope to be able to unearth them with little dficulty or disruption to the work at Cursiter Quarry.#We have been lucky to get the use of a fleet of wheelie bins in order for us to separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak.#While it has been assumed the figurine will remain in Orkney, authorities in Oban have already made representations for it to be ed to its place of origin.Kirkwall East councillor John Ross Scott was quick to defend OIC#s position, and suggested that plans may be afoot for a permanent visitor attraction, to be built on the Cursiter Quarry household Waste and recycling centre .In the meantime, a temporary portacabin has been sourced to house the figurine, he says.#The stone is legally ours, and we paid handsomely for it, so therefore the figurine is ours too,# he said.#I went out to visit the site, last night, as soon as I found out about the discovery. I wasn#t able to get in to see it, but I look forward to sharing photos of it on Facebook at the earliest opportunity.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Just today we have heard from Nova Innovation that they are now powering electric cars in Shetland directly from tidal energy, a clear sign of the potential for direct benefits in the immediate future.“These things are all happening and the industry is on the up, but without the final leg up from government – whether in Contracts for Dference or other fiscal support – then someone  will step in.#This is a chance for high-value jobs to be created across the UK and particularly in island communities, rather than importing technology that we could be leading on here.“The need for commercialisation support will only go away when that need is fulfilled, whether it is by the UK or others. With COP [the  United Nations Climate Change Conference] rapidly approaching, it is an opportunity for us to make a statement on a major green technology for the future – it is time to commit.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

with other options including legal action against the UK Government over its refusal to allow such a ballot.Mr Salmond appealed to Ms Sturgeon to work with him in pursuit of their shared goal.Speaking on the Today programme on BBC Radio , he said: ldquoThe cause of independence is much, much bigger than personalities.ldquoIt is a noble cause, a huge cause for Scotland, and everybody has to put

added: ldquoIf Boris Johnson casts this argument about independence as merely the Prime Minister against the First Minister, the Tories against the SNP, then he will likely continue to say no to

I would like to congratulate Kyleakin Playpark project on their award, theirs is an important project and will support people now and in the future when they can physically come back together to make great things happen in their community.”The final piece in the funding jigsaw came from a Highland Council ward discretionary grant of £,.Local councillor John Finlayson said: “Myself and fellow members were really impressed by the fundraising drive to date and the fact that through ious channels, almost £, of the funding was secured before the ward discretionary was turned to.“The fundraising to date made the decision to support the final piece in the jigsaw very easy and members were keen to point out that this project highlights how community drive and partnership working, that includes a clear strategic vision, can achieve positive outcomes.”James MacQueen Building Contractor’s Limited gave £, and a developers’ contribution from Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association of £, was made linked to the construction of the new houses.A further £, came through the Kyleakin Gala MOWI Scotland donated £, Kyleakin and Kylerhea Community Council gave £, online crowdfunding brought in £, while £ was raised through the Balmacara SPAR.It is hoped that the park will be completed by late summertime."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/LAMB-SALES-19-2.jpg","title":"the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIt is far from a new problem and one that very much sits hand in hand with a long-standing wider issue in relation to crofting development and productivity – lack of use and neglect.You don’t need to go far to come across overgrown and rank crofts, where fences have rotted away and the ground has been covered in a blanket of coarse, dead vegetation. It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests. The trouble is: there is precious little evidence of that calibre of inidual in Scotland’s political landscape of today.IT SEEMS like only yesterday I was talking about preparing for the winter and here we are with spring on the horizon. Soon the digital clock in the van will be at the right time again. I have more reason than usual to hope for a good lambing. The scanning results were on the disappointing side,  empty out of  and  sets of twins giving an overall percentage of around . Not a disaster by any means, particularly in this part of the world, but my own lowest tally ever, as usually I’m looking at somewhere around the  to  per cent mark.I suspect an underlying issue with fluke at tupping time. Fasciola hepaticais a tiny mud snail which is ingested through grazing and attacks the liver. It thrives in wet conditions and is re in Scotland.There are routine treatments, but it’s now recognised that the parasite is developing a resistance to some of the products on the market. As a result of that, the advice is to constantly use dferent ones and I probably wasn’t as meticulous in this as I should have been, although I know that others too have had increased problems with fluke in the early part of the winter – and it was horrendously wet in November through to December.So the dry, hard frost of a couple of weeks ago was a godsend and it was on such a bracing but beautul morning that we gathered for the scanning, the ground underfoot like uneven concrete. You could have gotten away with your trainers.Once the work was completeI linked up my iPhone with the scanner and a detailed breakdown of the results popped up on the screen. A couple of pings later and it was out in the ether, all the way out to the North Sea where it was downloaded by someone not able to be in attendance to view his own results almost instantaneously.It was a lovely symbiosis of tradition and technology, though goodness knows what the bodachs of yesteryear would have made of it all."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/John_Purser-202030713-edited.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais pure escapism among the fenian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThat may explain why story-telling and mythology were so highly prized.

You could say she was pursuing the romantic Celtic dream, but with Father Allan and the people of Eriskay she found it, and it was no more a dream than was she herself.We should be immensely grateful to her. Her style of writing may seem slightly arch to some today, but none other than Padraic Colum was happy to write the foreword to her book, full of praise for her writing skills.She was a kind of predecessor of Margaret Fay Shaw, that most redoubtable of ladies, made of Pittsburgh steel, chain-smoking and with a bourbon to hand and her beloved piano just across the room.

Daniel Kane found herself in Malawi - the fth poorest nation in the world. Malawi, with a population of almost million and only a handful of ventilators and very little PPE, was totally unprepared for the pandemic. Charlotte assisted in the initial response to the first surge of the coronavirus as it spread throughout Malawi. Currently, however, a second and more deadly wave is gripping the country with devastating consequences. Charlotte said: “There are ten times more cases than during the first wave and a projected exponential increase in the infection rate. “Access to hospitals and modern health care is extremely limited. Many covid- patients are being treated in temporary wards in carparks with oxygen cylinders and . “There is no ability to give patients ventilatory support and take them into intensive care. Frontline healthcare workers risk their lives every day without adequate PPE and basic essentials such as hand gel.”Another huge contrast with the UK is that it may be some time before poorer countries like Malawi can get the vaccine. Here in the UK, the vaccine rollout has been a massive success with every person eligible for a free vaccination on the NHS. In poorer countries it will take much longer even for the vaccine to reach frontline health workers and the most vulnerable. The “Economist” reckons that it will be  at least before there is widespread vaccine roll out. “This means that Malawians have at least two years to get through before there is effective vaccine cover. As the vaccine rolls out in advanced economies and many of us are starting to see a glimmer of hope that normality willsoon, the story in Malawi couldn’t be more dferent,” says Charlotte.For health systems which are already woefully under-resourced, dealing with a second wave and a new strain of COVID- is a monumental challenge. Hospitals and clinics are operating without the basics to protect their staff and patients. Basic levels of PPE and hand gels are in very short supply. Without this support fragile health systems will be decimated of their most precious resource at this time – healthcare workers as many are at home sick with COVID- or sadly dying. This comes at a time when hospitals are buckling under pressure and desperately need health workers to be able to work.Charlotte now works as a doctor in Liverpool where the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine has launched Bump It Forward campaign to help bring PPE and vaccines to Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe in an attempt to redress this massive health inequality. The fund raising campaign actually came about as the result of a dream.A Christian friend of Prof Melita Gordon, who works in Malawi fulltime as part of the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, dreamt about how she was to receive her vaccine free of charge and an idea emerged to ‘pay forwar’d the cost of that doseage to help people in countries who did not yet have vaccines. It was a very direct, personal idea that people in the UK who have had a vaccine get it for free while the people in Malawi don’t. People love the idea of the BumpitForward campaign as it provides the opportunity to give back the cost of the vaccine in the order of pound. which they get it for free to help protect healthcare workers in Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe until the vaccine reaches them and save lives.Dr. Kane says she would love to see a local response to the campaign after her experience at the Mulanje District Hospital.Charlotte says: “The hospital is doing a great job, providing quality, safe and dignied care in extremely dficult circumstances.“Just like in the UK, they have had staff shortages related to staff testing positive for COVID which has made things all the more dficult. The senior nurses have designed a protocol to make best use of reusable gowns and are very grateful to receive the PPE donation. “I worked at Mulanje for the first six months of  and they have been brilliantly supportive partners in MLW-led research into reducing deaths from sepsis and HIV associated TB, so it is a pleasure to be able to support our partners when they are in need of PPE at this time. #Bumpitforward is a wonderful campaign which I couldn’t recommend highly enough.Give the equivalent of your Covid- vaccine to protect frontline staff in African countries who will have to wait for theirs. You can help keep them safe by donating the equivalent cost of your vaccine, to protect them until they can get theirs. There has already been a huge response to the Bump It Forward campaign and it continues to grow! It has now raised over pound,.

Some may have wanted to shield, some parents may have had to stage at home to mind young children unable to go to school, he said.However, what is very strange is the vastly dferent numbers and proportion of staff seeking leave in each department and further clarication should be made to account for this.People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said the fact that almost % of workers employed by government departments have had to self-isolate through the Covid crisis shows you how much they have been placed at risk from Stormont#s shambolic handling of the pandemic. Although this figure would likely be underestimating the true figures for workers across our society, as it includes health workers who are employed by the department but not the trusts, nor do the figures include those working in retail or the private sector throughout the pandemic, he added.From forcing workers back into workplaces too soon, to adopting a reckless #living with Covid# strategy, the Executive#s approach has put workers and as a result their families directly at risk. The pattern throughout the last year was that when cases were declining but still circulating in our community, ministers decided it was a wise idea to lt restrictions and put people back into work, often in places were social distancing was dficult.Despite talks of learning lessons from Covid and respecting frontline workers the message hasn#t been followed through in the actions of Stormont ministers. Still people struggle to afford to socially isolate when they need to do so on the meagre financial assistance that exists.Separate figures also show how many staff were absent directly due to contracting Covid. From April  to December , of the , civil servants at Stormont, a total of  were diagnosed with coronavirus.The DfC had  workers test positive, while the Department of Justice saw  employees absent due to Covid and DfI recorded . The PPS had the fewest absences directly due to Covid at five, followed closely by the Executive Office with seven.Stormont departments are already dealing with staffing issues, with around , vacancies across the workforce at present.Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumNorthern Ireland Civil Service in union talks about remote working for ,-strong workforceThe Northern Ireland Civil Service is in talks with trade unions about future remote working for up to , workers, the Belfastcan reveal.Most ReadVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionUTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleFormer IRA men Arthurs and Quinn facing prosecution over Francie McNally funeral Mystery new firm may be on way to Northern Ireland retail park Man in his s dies in M crash Top VideosPlayFirst Minister calls SF actions ‘above the law’ and says police abdicated responsibility before, during and since Storey funeral PlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayNI Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey challenged to leave chair during Bobby Storey funeral debateLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCovid lockdown led to surge in schoolchildren suffering mental health issuesEaster : Everything you need to know from events, shop openings, public transport and when the bins go outCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases as Assembly votes to censure Sinn Fein over Bobby Storey funeral actionsBonfire builders to go ahead with Eleventh night celebrations after PPS Storey funeral decision outrageLatest from Belfast Newry haulier charged over £m drugs seizureNorth Belfast stabbing suspect disputes police video-recordingCarl Frampton v Jamel Herring: TV channel, ring walk time, odds and everything you need to know ahead of this week#s bout in Dubai ‘I’m Connor Phillamilton’: BBC host Connor Philips announces name changeNewtownabbey man jailed for sharing indecent child images,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Q: Can I take part in physical activity with others A: Up to  people — including children — from a maximum of two households can now take part in outdoor sports activities.Outdoor sports facilities can reopen but only to permit their use for those allowed in the health regulations.You can play again at your local golf club, have a game of tennis or go for a walk or run with friends over Easter.Club houses must remain closed under the Covid- restrictions, apart from essential toilet facilities. Car-sharing, sporting celebrations and any congregation of people watching sporting events should still be avoided.Q: Is there anything I can do to safely celebrate Easter with my loved ones A: Despite the Covid regulations in place there are still many ways we can celebrate the holiday either in person or online.With the easing of regulations in private gardens, you could host an Easter egg hunt for the children in your family or have an egg and spoon race.Many people enjoy painting eggs or making an Easter-themed wreath.Why not host a Zoom party and do those activities together with your friends and loved ones or do it yourself and give them as a gt Many churches across Northern Ireland will also be hosting an online service to mark Easter Sunday.Q: When will the restrictions ease further and what does that mean for me A: On Monday, April , Northern Ireland will take another step out of lockdown. Training for up to  people from sports clubs will be able take place outdoors, contactless click and collect will be permitted for all non-essential retail, and up to  people from two households can meet in private gardens.The Executive’s next formal review of the restrictions will take place on or before Thursday, April .Belfast Most ReadUTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionFormer IRA men Arthurs and Quinn facing prosecution over Francie McNally funeral Mystery new firm may be on way to Northern Ireland retail park Man in his s dies in M crash Top VideosPlayFirst Minister calls SF actions ‘above the law’ and says police abdicated responsibility before, during and since Storey funeral PlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayNI Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey challenged to leave chair during Bobby Storey funeral debateLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCovid lockdown led to surge in schoolchildren suffering mental health issuesEaster : Everything you need to know from events, shop openings, public transport and when the bins go outCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases as Assembly votes to censure Sinn Fein over Bobby Storey funeral actionsBonfire builders to go ahead with Eleventh night celebrations after PPS Storey funeral decision outrageLatest from Belfast Belfast City Council: Bank closures, Mullaghglass landfill and more on agenda for monthly meetingNI keeper Trevor Carson reveals gambling hell left him at #rock bottom#UUP#s Beattie attacks Sinn Féin over Storey funeral debateNewry haulier charged over £m drugs seizureNorth Belfast stabbing suspect disputes police video-recording,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Merchant Square is an indication of what Belfast can achieve.”Noel Lander, director at JLL, said: “The landmark sale of Merchant Square demonstrates the investor appetite for best in class regional offices with secure income streams and strong environmental, social and corporate governancecredentials.”Oakland was advised by JLL, AL Goodbody and KPMG. The purchaser was advised by SPS Investment, King  Spalding International LLP, TLT LLP and BDO LLP.Speaking to the Belfastearlier this year, Kevin MacAllister, PwC Northern Ireland regional market lead, said its move into the new offices — expected later this year — coincided with a new era in work. “Undoubtedly the world of working and how we deliver professional services will change, but it’s not either or, office or home working. We’ll be into a much more blended, flexible working regime.“We’ve been developing it quite closely with our people, and quite a signicant part of the floor space will be a wellbeing area. We’ll be providing things like onsite healthcare with GP services, yoga classes — anything that has a wellbeing angle to it.”He added: “We’re trying to bridge the gap between home and office and sort of blur the lines a little bit, so you make an office an extension of home.”The NI Civil Service has said it’s consulting with trade unions on a future remote working policy for its staff of ,.Belfast Most ReadUTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionFormer IRA men Arthurs and Quinn facing prosecution over Francie McNally funeral Mystery new firm may be on way to Northern Ireland retail park Man in his s dies in M crash Top VideosPlayFirst Minister calls SF actions ‘above the law’ and says police abdicated responsibility before, during and since Storey funeral PlayNI Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey challenged to leave chair during Bobby Storey funeral debatePlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursLatest Northern IrelandBelfast City Council: Bank closures, Mullaghglass landfill and more on agenda for monthly meetingNI keeper Trevor Carson reveals gambling hell left him at #rock bottom#UUP#s Beattie attacks Sinn Fein over Storey funeral debateNewry haulier charged over £m drugs seizureNorthern Ireland Nightingale court facilities extended for three monthsLatest from Belfast Belfast City Council: Bank closures, Mullaghglass landfill and more on agenda for monthly meetingNI keeper Trevor Carson reveals gambling hell left him at #rock bottom#UUP#s Beattie attacks Sinn Fein over Storey funeral debateNewry haulier charged over £m drugs seizureNorthern Ireland Nightingale court facilities extended for three months,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Headed by matriarch Katherine, played by Amanda Burton, the clan was infiltrated by Marcella , who went undercover as Keira Devlin.Series location manager Chris Myers said Larchfield House was ideal for the shoot as it was large enough to suggest the status of our story#s resident family but not so daunting in scale as to be unimaginable as a home.While the family#s dark behaviours might have shocked many viewers, it seems the beauty of the area still appealed.Coming in at fourth place in the top  of drama locations that have helped spark a property boom is ITV police drama The Bay, written by Co Armagh man Daragh Carville.Property prices in the coastal Lancashire town of Morecambe rose by .% - a jump of % on nearby Scale Hall. House prices now average £,.Earlier this year property website Rightmove revealed searches for homes in Morecambe surged by % in just one week, coinciding with the airing of season two of The Bay.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":true The adaptation of Sally Rooney#s Normal People is also being credited for a rise in property prices in Co Sligo. Sharing joint final place in the list with Marcella, the location used in Normal People for much of the shoot also saw a rise of .% - % more than neighbouring Leitrim.Topping the list of television locations that have inspired househunters is Dunlop in East Ayrshire, set of ITV drama Deadwater Fell. Dunlop saw an increase of .% in property prices in , more than double that of nearby East Kilbride.Other locations to make the list include Beaconsfield for Afterle, Sutton Hoo for The Dig, and Richmond-upon-Thames for Bridgerton, which saw prices rise by .% to an average of £,.Miles Robinson of Trussle said: The last year has seen a big sht in homeowner priorities.Searches for properties in small towns and villages doubled as city dwellers opted for countryside living.Increased time spent indoors led to one in seven adults considering a move to a home with more space and it seems our favourite TV programmes are inspiring us too, becoming much more than an #escape from reality#.Drama locations influenced property hikes before the pandemic too. Shows such as Poldark and Doc Martin saw more people want to relocate to Cornwall, while the Broadchurch effect resulted in property prices shooting up in West Bay, Dorset.Belfast Most ReadUTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionFormer IRA men Arthurs and Quinn facing prosecution over Francie McNally funeral Mystery new firm may be on way to Northern Ireland retail park Man in his s dies in M crash Top VideosPlayFirst Minister calls SF actions ‘above the law’ and says police abdicated responsibility before, during and since Storey funeral PlayNI Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey challenged to leave chair during Bobby Storey funeral debatePlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursLatest Northern IrelandBelfast City Council: Bank closures, Mullaghglass landfill and more on agenda for monthly meetingNI keeper Trevor Carson reveals gambling hell left him at #rock bottom#UUP#s Beattie attacks Sinn Fein over Storey funeral debateNewry haulier charged over £m drugs seizureNewtownabbey man jailed for sharing indecent child imagesLatest from Belfast Belfast City Council: Bank closures, Mullaghglass landfill and more on agenda for monthly meetingNI keeper Trevor Carson reveals gambling hell left him at #rock bottom#UUP#s Beattie attacks Sinn Fein over Storey funeral debateNewry haulier charged over £m drugs seizureNorth Belfast stabbing suspect disputes police video-recording,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The two men helped plan and lead an IRA escape from the Maze Prison in the s. He is highly unlikely to apologise publicly for being at the funeral.The North Belfast MLA represents the older guard of the party. It is his job to keep the republican base on board, leaving the diplomacy in times of crisis to the newer wing of Sinn Fein.The party is in a tricky position, balancing the anger of those who sacriced family funerals because of the Covid restrictions with not being seen to be subservient to the demands of the DUP.Ahead of the Easter break, when republicans commemorate their dead, sackcloth and ashes apologies will not play out well with their base.What does this mean for the DUP, which needs to be seen as tough on Sinn Fein or face further criticism from Jim Allister, who has the party chasing him around for the working-class loyalist vote Mr Allister said earlier this week that all unionist politicians should walk away from the Policing Board in protest at the decision not to prosecute anyone in relation to attendance at the funeral. Not so long ago, this would have been viewed as a radical suggestion, but his calls appear to be gaining traction with DUP Junior Minister Gordon Lyons, who told the BBC the party was considering its position on the oversight body.Walking away from public bodies may make a statement in the short term, but where does that leave unionism#s long-term strategy going forward,those whose resignations it has called for simply choose to ride out the storm The criticism of the Chief Constable, allegations of two-tier policing and questioning the motivation of the PSNI at a time of loyalist unrest is a very dangerous game for the DUP to be playing.With tensions around the sea border and loyalists in some areas withdrawing cooperation with police on community bodies, any ramping up of tensions could be used as cover by those hell-bent on taking opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol onto the streets.The announcement by the PPS on Wednesday that the decision on the Storey funeral was to be reviewed by independent counsel may well buy some time for unionists to revise their strategy.Meanwhile, on what should have been a quiet holiday week, the Executive is facing yet another political crisis, leaving many askingthe devolved government is fit for purpose.Belfast Most ReadUTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen roleVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionFormer IRA men Arthurs and Quinn facing prosecution over Francie McNally funeral Mystery new firm may be on way to Northern Ireland retail park Man in his s dies in M crash Top VideosPlayFirst Minister calls SF actions ‘above the law’ and says police abdicated responsibility before, during and since Storey funeral PlayNI Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey challenged to leave chair during Bobby Storey funeral debatePlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursLatest Northern IrelandBelfast City Council: Bank closures, Mullaghglass landfill and more on agenda for monthly meetingNI keeper Trevor Carson reveals gambling hell left him at #rock bottom#UUP#s Beattie attacks Sinn Fein over Storey funeral debateNewry haulier charged over £m drugs seizureNorthern Ireland Nightingale court facilities extended for three monthsLatest from Belfast Belfast City Council: Bank closures, Mullaghglass landfill and more on agenda for monthly meetingNI keeper Trevor Carson reveals gambling hell left him at #rock bottom#UUP#s Beattie attacks Sinn Fein over Storey funeral debateNewry haulier charged over £m drugs seizureNorthern Ireland Nightingale court facilities extended for three months,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Foyle MLA commented: “I have been contacted by a number of constituents this week, anxious that they may be fined, following a gaffe by the Census office. “Many who had completed and ed their Census forms before the  March deadline, have been contacted by Census enumerators who claimed their forms were outstanding and detailed potential fines. googletag.cmd.push “After contacting the Census team, it would appear that duplicate paper forms have been issued for addresses in DerryandLondonderry. Essentially, this seems to be due to an administrative error which has identied our city as two separate cities. This is not the first time that the double naming of our hometown has been a source of confusion but the mind boggles as to how this mistake was not realised sooner in the process. “I have called on NISRA to resolve this issue, however in the interim I would advise anyone contacted about non-compliance to explain the situation which can then be recorded on the Census system.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Redcastle hotel is located in the once proud and independent peninsula of Inishowen. The last of the Irish chieftains with whom this site is associated was Cahir ODoherty. Cahir became chieftain at the age of  in , after the death of his father, Sir John O Doherty. In order to secure his position, Cahir changed his family’s side in the Nine Year War year and swore loyalty to Queen Elizabeth, because of Inishowens important strategic location and the defeat of the Confederates at Kinsale in . googletag.cmd.push The war ended in . It resulted in the Flight of the Earls from Rathmullan in  and the Plantation of Ulster. Cahir thought his reward for his help and loyalty would be great. But apart from being knighted and acquiring the title Sir, he was to be disappointed. In frustration the -year-old chieftain rebelled in , sacking the English held city of Derry and burning it to the ground. He was killed shortly after this in the Battle of Kilmacrennan, just outside Letterkenny. Because of this rebellion King James I ordered the great walls of Derry to be built. After Cahir, the last Inishowen Chieftain, was killed, all his lands in Inishowen were seized by the James I for plantation and ided between The Established church and Arthur Chichester. The two separate entities that were then Inishowen and Tyrconnell were joined and made into one county. It was named Donegal. googletag.cmd.push The first house built on the site of the Redcastle hotel was built by the Carey family. The Cary family were landlords who received plantation lands from Moville to Muff. The family lived here from about  to , almost exactly  years. Unfortunately for the Careys, they had money problems and eventually were forced to sell the Redcastle house and Estate in . Thomas Doherty from Muff purchased the house from the Careys, but because of legal issues it took  years for them to complete the sale. The most famous of the Careys was Joyce Carey. Joyce Cary was listed in the top  writers in English by The Sunday Times. Some of his books were made into film. His son and grandson continued in the creative theme and were involved in TV series such as Dr Who and Captain Pugwash.     Thomas Doherty left the estate to his youngest daughter, Jane, who was married to Dr Richard Doherty, a lecturer in midwery in Queens University, Galway. Dr Richard Doherty died in  and his we Jane in . Richard converted to Catholicism late in his le and left the Redcastle estate to his daughter, Elizabeth and her husband Captain Ernest Cochrane, on the condition that the children be brought up as Catholics. The year before Elizabeth died she was in dispute with the local land league on the reduction of rents. Armed men were employed to secure her crops after locals refused to harvest them. They were unsuccessful at getting the crops harvested, but it is said they did get through quite an amount of Jameson whiskey and food. Captain Ernest Cochrane was the son of the famous and notorious Lord Thomas Cochrane, on which the films Master and Commander and Hornblower are based. Earnests famous bloodline does not end there as he is also a descendent of Robert the Bruce who actually invaded and occupied Northburg Castle in Greencastle for a short period. True love must have been very much in the air as the condition that Richard Doherty left for marriage and inheritance at this time would have been quite a diplomatic feat, given that Earnest was also the high sherf of Donegal. But they managed it. Captain Cochrane went to church in his Model T car. Reg number Hand Elizabeth and her children in their horse and carriage to Drung Chapel. To this day they are still separated, Earnest in a grand monument grave in front of the now derelict Church of Ireland Church in Redcastle. Elizabeth Francis with her children and her parents are interred at the alter area of the old Catholic Church, Drung. After the ious land acts that were introduced after , landlordism went into terminal decline. Lands were sold off and the large houses were either left to rot away or knocked down to avoid taxes on them. Redcastle House survived. Captain Earnest Cochrane died in  and Elizabeth Francis in . The Cochranes remained and turned their hand to farming and in the s opened the Redcastle House as an Hotel. The Cochranes sold Redcastle in  and the hotel is now once again back in the ownership of a Doherty.

There is not a girl woman anywhere who doesnt like a piece of jewellery or an aromatic fragrance. You could include a few men in that, too! Among them are two young Derry girls who love all things glittery and sparkly – and a nice fragrance – so much so, they have used their time during Covid- lockdown to start up their own fragrance business. Sisters Mia, , and Bella Doherty, , from Cornshell Fields in the Ballyarnett of the city, named their enterprise Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella- a combination of their names – and after almost a year of research, trials and checking out regulations, they have their enterprise up and running. googletag.cmd.push At the minute, they are making wax melts of ious fragrances and shapes along with room sprays to match the wax melts smells. They are also currently looking into other products as well. Mia, who attends St Marys College, said they began researching soon after the Covid- restrictions were introduced in March last year. She added: “We undertook online courses in candle-making tohelp our wee idea become a reality. “We tried out dferenttypes of soya wax andfragrances with our family being thetesters, much to their delight for a goodfew months. “We wanted to be % happywith our product before we decidedthey were ready for purchase.So the launch of Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella began last month. googletag.cmd.push “We are both currentlyusing our mum’s kitchen but she doesn’tmind as we clean up after ourselves and her house always smells solovely for her. “Also, by law, we have to follow certain regulations, so have to ensure CIP labels are made for every fragranceoil and then bepresently packaged. This can all take a lot of timebut we really love being creative and by adding glitter and colour and trying out dferent designs makes our wax melts stand out compared to others.Having nice packaging and how they are presented is very important to us “We make wax melts by melting soya wax and adding fragrancesoils and pour into moulds, although this sounds very straight forwardthere is temperature taking anda few step-by-step instructions that need to be adhered toin order to maintain a good quality product that will last.”     Despite the success and the enjoyment of making fragrances, Mia said she was looking forward to going back to school. “St Mary’sis a fantastic school and I love getting up to go to school every morning.” She admitted she was a bit concerned about how much catching up she will have to do but said she was sure the teachers would put everyone at ease when they were all back in the classroom. “We definitely missed schoola lot,especiallynot seeing our friends was dficult but starting this business has helpedkeep us occupied and easeanyboredom. “Learning our craft and keeping upwithschoolwork has made the wholeCovidsituation fly in for us. Weare so busy at the minutewith orders for delivery that our mum had to help out as well. She is able to help at the minute as her business is currently closed due toCovid- restric- tions.She was a great help at the start as she was able to guide us in the right direction - we have even roped dad into helping by doing the deliveries.” She added: “I hope we go back to normality as I like the hands on physical activities at school like technology and science experiments.” Bella, who ed to P at Steelstown Primary School on Monday last, said despite the enjoying of producing Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella products, school work was her priority. “I was a bit nervous about ingto school but it was great. I have a new teacher and she is really lovely. It was great seeing all my friends as well. This is my last year in primary school so I am really happy to be getting backto see everyone before I have to make the transition to secondary school.” Bella said they had been inundated with very positive reviews for their range of products. “Everyone seems to love the product going by the lovely messages we receive.Customers wish us every success andfor more orders so this makes us very happy. “When we are back at school full-time and not able to commitour time as much to the business as school is the priority, my aunties are willing to help out to keep us well stocked up with our products. “The people in our cityand beyondhave been really supportive inshopping local, it feels good to know we’re doing something right.” The girls mother, Maria, is understandably so proud of her two girls, being the owner of Miabella beauty salon next to the car wash on Racecourse Road in Shantallow which has been closed for nine months of the past year. She said: “If there’s one thing I can take from lockdownis that I work too much and the girls missed me, so spending quality time and helping them out with their wax melts was amazing. I’ve learned so much from them and how much of a work ethicis instilled into them, “I am so proud of them both andhow they have juggled both school work and their newly established business. “They both are managing perfectly so farand I can go back to work and know they are perfectly capable of staying on top of orders. “As their mum, though, I will keep on top of the social mediato ensure their safety - their page is linked to my phone so I can keep them safe.” Maria conceded she has found lockdown extremely dficultat times. She added: “I really miss my clients, as a lot of them have become friends over the years. It’s always good to catch up with each other.I’m so looking forward to seeing each and every single one of them when I canalthough trying to fit everyone in will prove to be a dficult task. “Somehow, I’ll man- ageshould I work night and day to get you all beautied again.I don’t like to disappoint anyone when they look for appointments, my clients are lovely and are very understanding.” So Chanel, Jimmy Choo and Gucci, take note of the name - Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Magherafelt has been included in the regions top three, alongside Strangford Loch and outright winner, Holywood, both in County Down. Expert judges behind the Sunday Times guide assessed a number of factors in making their decision, from schools, air quality, transport and broadband speed to culture, green spaces and the high street. They looked for improving towns, villages or city centres, for attractive, well-designed homes and locations bursting with community spirit. Magherafelt was selected as a supremely practical choice for families thanks to its convenient central location, rapidly improving town centre and excellent schools. googletag.cmd.push Local grammar school Rainey Endowed, which recently won the Sunday Times School of the Decade award, was singled out for praise. Judges were also impressed by the sports facilities at Meadowbank Multi-Sports Arena and Moyola Park Golf Club, as well as the towns choice of hairdressers, beauty salons and coffee shops. Sunday Times Property Editor, Helen Davies, said this had been a good year for small towns. “This guide has never been so important. The pandemic has taught us just how much we rely on our homes, our communities and our surroundings,” she said. “With working from home now common, it’s no surprise that many of us are reassessing our priorities and thinking hard about where we really want to live. googletag.cmd.push “Our focus for this year has been community, countryside and convenience. It hasn’t been a year for big cities or small villages. “Instead it is small towns that have shone: big enough to have everything you need within walking distance and small enough for everyone to feel connected.” Local councillor Darren Totten said the announcement was no surprise to him as a Magherafelt man. The focus of the experts is on amenities, location, educational and sporting facilities - which this study rightly shows to be amongst the very best available, he said. For me, though, the very best of Magherafelt is that we have a great community in the town and main ingredient in any community is the people.     The people of Magherafelt have proven many times in recent years that when anyone is in need, its all hands to the pump regardless of who it is needs help.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, SDLP Foyle MLA Mark H Durkan has expressed reservations about the proposal for the Fort George site. “While it would be foolish not to see the merit in a new health hub, particularly in the current climate, Fort George is perhaps not the most suitable location, said Mr Durkan. “People will no doubt see this announcement as falling short of earlier proposals, promises and plans. In short, it could be deemed a reduction in terms of ambition.     I am of the opinion that this strategically important development site would be better utilised for something that adds real value economically to the city and beyond. “However, that being said, I am acutely aware of the challenges facing our health service pre-pandemic. A system already at breaking point has struggled under the weight of the past year- this state-of-the-art facility will I hope, take pressure off that system and ensure the effective delivery of integrated health services for the surrounding areas. The creation of  permanent jobs is also good news, particularly in conjunction with the transfer of Health Sciences to Magee University, which I hope will encourage more students to train and remain.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The shutting of the outlet at Lisnagelvin Shopping Centre is one of  stores earmarked for closure across Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North East of England. The companys other store in the city at Foyleside Shopping Centre on the cityside is to remain open. The closures have been prompted by ongoing challenges to high street trading, which have been exacerbated by the Covid- pandemic. Semichem, which is owned by community retailer Scotmid Co-operative, said it was in talks with landlords in several locations and would make a final decision on a small number of the  stores in the coming months. googletag.cmd.push A total of  Semichem staff have now entered a formal consultation process. Management at Scotmid Co-operative, owners of Semichem, said they were exploring opportunities to redeploy as many as possible within its wider business. Karen Scott, head of Semichem, said: “The high street was already struggling to adapt to the pace of change in shopping habits, including out-of-town developments and the rise of internet shopping. That change has undoubtedly been accelerated by the Covid- pandemic. Sadly, we have reached the point where it is no longer viable to keep some of our stores open. “We are grateful for both Scotmid and subsequent government sup- port, which has undoubtedly prolonged the le of many stores.

Many of the pieces have been dedicated to inidual key workers in the city as a thank-you for all their tireless efforts throughout the pandemic. Recent visitors to Foyleside Shopping Centre will definitely feel that Spring is in the air with the installation of the colourful handiwork which is aptly entitled ‘New Beginnings’. Beautul bunnies and charming chicks are just some of the cute characters featured in the vibrant craft masterpieces together with an assortment of intricately stitched throws guaranteed to bring smiles to the faces of visitors of all ages. googletag.cmd.push  The seasonal installation will reach an audience of millions after award-winning local production company, AlleycatsTV, produced a short film in celebration of the women whose devotion to crochet has helped them overcome the challenges of lockdown. The queen of crochet is Margaret Crabtree who has been teaching the craft for almost three decades after volunteering for a fundraiser at her daughter’s nursery school in the s. Coming from a family of crafters, Margaret now loves to share her expertise and see other women thrive with their new-found skills. Through her business, ‘Keep Her Knit’, she teaches more than a dozen classes in Derry city as well as in Counties Derry, Tyrone and Donegal. googletag.cmd.push Classes have moved online during lockdown, providing a leline for her students, many of whom are older and or living alone. Margaret said: “We wanted to do something to show that we’re together, even though we’re apart. The crochet groups I take are like a family. I’ve been taking classes by Zoom during the pandemic, but we all really miss the social aspect of meeting up. “Working on the ‘New Beginnings’ pieces gave us something to focus on and it’s fantastic to see them all up in Foyleside, they are a mix of ability levels and some of them are real masterpieces but it’s so good for everyone’s self-esteem, regardless of the level.     “All the ladies in my groups keep saying to one another, ‘what would we have done all daywe hadn’t been crocheting ’ so it’s good to know that it’s helped them get through the boredom and isolation of the lockdowns. They are a real community, stitching the city together the skill level is phenomenal and a tribute to our heritage of sewing which is in the genes and it’s just great to be able to showcase it. I’m always striving to bring these talents to a wider audience.” The project was funded by Bluebell Arts Derry through the Department for Communities. Two of Margarets students, Mary Walsh and Theresa McSwiney, are both interviewed for tonight’s programme. Niamh Minihan from AlleycatsTV said: “I have been aware of the fantastic talent amongst the Keep Her Knit members for a long time. Some of my own family love to crochet and have been taught by Margaret Crabtree. It has been a real pleasure for me to direct this film and shine a light on such a positive story for our city. Alleycats are a Derry-based company and we are passionate about telling stories from our hometown.” Fergal Rafferty, Manager of Foyleside Shopping Centre, is delighted to see its spacious mall transformed for Spring. He said: “Foyleside always loves to support and showcase the skills of local people and the communities we serve. The New Beginnings display is really eye-catching, the level of talent in our city is remarkable and the colours and theme will be so uplting for all of our valued customers and staff coming into the Centre over Easter. We have no doubt that viewers of ‘The One Show’ will love it just as much as we do too.” Tune in to ‘The One Show’ on BBC One this evening, March , at pm, to see Margaret, Theresa and Mary from the Gasyard classes and Foyleside in all its Easter glory!  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The partys Foyle MLA Gary Middleton was speaking this week at the launch of a new report into the views of Protestants living in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area. The study, which was carried out on behalf of the Londonderry Bands Forum, interviewed more than  people in the council area to find out their views on a wide range of issues. A similar study was carried out in  in conjunction with Queens University and the University of Ulster. googletag.cmd.push When compared to the  findings, the new study shows a % increase in the number of Protestants under the age of  who feel welcome throughout the city town in which they live.

In the new study, this figure has fallen to %. The percentage of people who say they feel comfortable visiting Foyle Street has witnessed a similar decline from % to %. The new study highlights that the Peace Bridge and the bringing of Protestant cultural events to the cityside has had an evident impact on cross-city mobility. googletag.cmd.push The new report was launched on Monday. Speaking during a discussion to mark the launch, Mr Middleton welcomed the new report and said initiatives such as the construction of the Peace Bridge and the  City of Culture celebrations had helped make the local Protestant community feel more welcome in the city. “Thatplayed a huge role in getting people across to ious events right across the city where they felt, you know what, it doesnt matterI am Protestant or Catholic or whatever background I come from I can feel part of this and I am welcome,” he said.     Mr Middleton praised ongoing cross-community projects but said it was important that they had an impact and were not just tokenism. “There needs to be a feeling thatwe are going to be involved in this, then there is going to be a genuine partnership, it is not tick box exercise. We want a lasting legacy from some of the projects we are going to be involved in.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson also spoke at this weeks event and said there were some very positives from the new report. She also praised the cross-community work of local groups and said that efforts must continue to make people from a Protestant background feel welcome in the local area. “As someone who had felt that I was born into a state that did not want me or welcome me, I do not want people in the Protestant unionist loyalist community that they are in a city which doesnt want them or welcome them,” she said. “The fact that the research has said that a signicant number of them feel that they are not wanted or that they feel that the other community wants them to leave. “I certainly do not want people from the Protestant unionist loyalist community to leave. “I think the research is a great foundation stone on which we can build to outreach and engage respectfully and have conversations going forward,” she added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is the daunting schedule facing Connor Coyle next week as he steps into the ring for the first time in  months. The Derry middleweight will fly to Mexico for the equivalent of a long weekend as he aims to get his professional career back on track in . The -year-old, who is -, has not been in action since January last year when he defeated Miguel Dumas, and he is eager to get going once again. On April th, he will step into the ring in Chihuahua, Mexico against hometown boxer Esteban Villalba , after a break of  days due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. googletag.cmd.push It has been a long, long wait for Coyle, who has never stopped training in the hope that he would get the phone call for his next fight. “I didn’t think I would have been out this long. I’m just happy that there’s now something in front of me,” he said. “It’s completely dferent when you have a focus. I haven’t stopped training since my last fight but you push yourself to a dferent level when you have a fight in front of you. You feel a massive dference in the gym when you now you have a focus, especially trying to get your weight down. googletag.cmd.push “You need that motivation and that hunger to be training for something. The excitement is there and I have a lot more energy because I am pushing myself for something, rather than just ticking over and training to keep myself in shape. Because I haven’t stopped from my previous fight, that helped keep the momentum up whenever I really had to put the head down.”  Daunting Schedule There is no doubting that Coyle faces a dficult schedule next week. He has very little time to adapt to the change in setting, with what plans to be a hectic few days, with just two days in Mexico before he steps into the ring.      “I’ve never done this before,” he admitted. “I know when I travel to Florida I arrive at night time and sleep that night so I’m up fresh the next morning to go training. This is basically going to be the same thing. I’m flying over at night-time so when I get over I’ll be able to get some rest and get up and weigh in and rest again until the fight. I don’t think I’ll have any problems because it’s straight over and back. I’ll probably feel it coming back because it will catch up with me but on the way over I think I’ll be okay.” Villalba will be Coyle’s third Mexican opponent in succession, but despite a rather inconsistent record, the Derry man is expecting this particular Mexican to be on a dferent level. “I don’t know too much about him but I know he’s a tough operator and he’s very, very durable,” he explained. “We’re fighting in his home town so he’ll have no travelling to do, he’ll get up out of his bed and go and weigh in, or go and fight or whatever. He’ll be well rested. “All Mexicans are tough operators so I’ll be going into the lion’s den in this one and I’ll be expecting hard rounds, so hopefully we can get him out of there early. My last two opponents were Mexican, but this guy takes it to another level. He’ll be tougher.” Ultimately, the goal for Coyle is to get back to America, with this fight seen as something of a warm up for the real action when he gets back to the States. “They are making it very dficult with the travelling and the restrictions so I’m going to try and make the most of it when I go where and stay for a few fights,” he stated. poundIf all goes well and I go over in August or September, I’ll possibly stay until Christmas time and get in as many fights as I can until then.” Sponsors Connor would like to thank the following sponsors for their continued support, especially during such a dficult time. They are: Thirsty Goat, Celebrity Slots, Classique Floor Designs, Central Site Development, Doire Designs, The Bentley Bar, Conor Curleys Cars, Frankie Ramseys, Brooklands Fencing, Archibald Construction, RB Tiling Services, Pauls Butchers and Olympus Fitness. He would also like to give a huge thanks St. Josephs Boxing Coach Cahir Duffy for the last  weeks of training as well as Strength and Conditioning coach Kyle Wallace.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I remember going to bed a little tipsy, the true version would not be believed long before the snowflake culture.Jeff proudly captained the first team for seven seasons, winning back-to-back McGready Cup finals at Dundrum after beating North West Cricket Union teams Bonds Glen and The Nedd.ldquoBoth games had a fantastic atmosphere. They brought a full  seater bus packed with refreshments and both teams stayed long into the night at the Bay Inn as they enjoyed the village hospitality.However, there were hard times for Dundrum as Jeff recalls a second arson attack against the club  years ago.ldquoIt simply showed the fighting character of the committee and members. I wrote lots of begging letters and phone calls for help, he recalled.ldquoI got a massive shock when I received a cheque made out to myself for pound, from the Foundation of Sports and Arts. I give special thanks to former Australian player James Burston for his input.The club received a further pound, from Down District Council and used local firm Seamus Walsh and Sons to build the excellent present pavilion at the cost of pound,, signying the start of rebuilding the club in every aspect.Paying homage to the clubrsquos ground staff who Jeff calls ldquothe real stalwarts, he gives praise to Tommy Curlett , who has looked after the square for over  years.

From clearing the banks to planting the hedges and securing grants, he is a very tight treasurer that all clubs need.Not only a celebrated player, it is clear that Jeff has became an influential figure at the Dundrum club.Twelve years ago the club backed his request to employ the first of many successful overseas coaches, Sri Lankan Manoj Fernando.ldquoIt is the main reason the club isthriving, he said. ldquoThe junior section has been very successful with six of the players now playing for the first team and many more playing for the seconds and thirds.ldquoThe juniors have been on tour to Scotland three times, whilst also going to Telford. There is another good crop of kids coming through.Alongside his achievements on the field, Jeff nods kindly to the accolade he received in  when he was presented with the Jim McMorran Waterford Crystal Bowl for voluntary services to cricket from the Northern Cricket Union.ldquoFor my th birthday, I ran a fundraising soft ball fun match and barbecue, which raised pound, towards new set covers.

I could not believe we raised pound, towards a new electric scorebox.ldquoIt was a very emotional day for me as I wandered around the ground with my grandson James. I was amazed at the decent crowd as I bowled the first ball and walked off to enjoy the day. But deep down, it hurt that I could not play.Jeff will be holding his last ever fundraiser this July, with the money going towards new enclosed two bay practice nets.

Itrsquos a point that anglers disagree with.DERA explained the work on the banks of the river created two dedicated disabled parking spaces in the car park where previously there had been none and that it is not satisfactory for disabled anglers to make their way to access current angling facilities located away from the car park.A spokesman for Downpatrick anglers said they are pleased that consideration is now being given to providing two new dedicated disabled fishing stands.ldquoWe welcome DAERArsquos confirmation that officials are also keen to meet with us to discuss our concerns which is an important step forward, he said.ldquoThe fact that the rights of disabled anglers at the Quoile River are now being recognised is also a welcome step forward. Redeveloping the car park and providing disabled parking spaces but no area for those with mobility issues to fish from was an error which now looks as though it is going to be rectied.The spokesman said he hopes that DAERA will also inform Newry, Mourne and Down Council about the plan to now provide disabled fishing stands at the riverbank car park.ldquoWe would hope councillors are informed via email or letter so there is a record of the commitment to carry out this work, he said.ldquoMoving forward, we believe that there is a need for DAERA and the Environment Agency to join forces to develop a training programme for their respective staff on how to handle the needs of disabled anglers in particular.The spokesman said lessons need to be learned from the Quoile River debacle and hopes that everyone involved can now move forward in partnership.ldquoDisabled anglers have been stopped coming to the river to fish for over a year since work to redevelop the car park got underway. Had the needs of disabled anglers been uppermost in the minds of government officials at the planning stage, it would not have taken  months to reach the point we are now thankfully at, he said.ldquoEveryone associated with Downpatrick Anglers is looking forward to seeing the new fishing stands in place soon and the welcomeof disabled anglers. They are part and parcel of the fishing community and must enjoy equal rights when it comes to their support.The spokesman added: ldquoAs we have always said, fishing is very therapeutic and we would strongly argue that the provision of new disabled angling stands on the banks of the Quoile should be a priority and will be of tremendous benefit..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Shirley.jpg","title":"Fountain Foodbank thanks public for help in lockdown  ","story":"THE Fountain Foodbank is continuing with its vital role in supporting families across the district.A year after going into lockdown, the cross-community organisation based in Downpatrick mdash staffed by committed volunteers mdash continues to meet a pressing need.In its latest newsletter, the foodbank says it continues to be extremely well supported by local people and organisations and that every penny it receives makes a dference.Shirley Lennon, the foodbankrsquos co-ordinator, has revealed that decisions regarding how the organisation could operate during a global pandemic had to be made quickly to deal with the evolving situation and continually revised as time moved on.She explained that initially, the foodbank operated a lsquodrive-thrursquo service which soon had to be replaced with a delivery service for the first period of lockdown.ldquoWe were grateful to many younger people who helped with both the packing and delivery of these parcels.

These workers are not using buses or cars and it is good financially that they donrsquot have to pay for car parking or fuel. And for Downpatrick, there will be dozens more people on the streets in the town, bring lots of benefits.Mr McGrath also acknowledged that the move towards regional hubs could result in empty office space in and around Belfast where a huge number of civl servants were traditionally based.ldquoThatrsquos the challenge mdash to repurpose those buildings mdash but we certainly cannot have vacant government buildings in the city centre being held on to for five,  or  years, he continued.The local MLA also believes that moving civil servants away from Belfast could provide an economic spin-offs for towns like Downpatrick.He added: ldquoIrsquom a fan of decentralisation in the public sector. It guarantees footfall in regional towns and that brings fairness to the rate and taxpayer. They get the benefits of having a workforce near them, especially the hospitality and retail businesses.ldquoIf you have  or  civil servants there they will spend a certain amount of money every week in those businesses while the city centre has a dferent product it can sell to attract those people at weekends.Developing Rathkeltair House as a regional jobs hub has been welcomed by a number of local politicians who say that the opportunity to combine working from home with the traditional office experience, enables civil servants to have a much more attractive work le balance as part of the Covid- recovery.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he was delighted that Rathkeltair House was one of several new regional civil servant job hubs which will allow public sector staff to work closer from home.ldquoThere are many people who travel from the Downpatrick area each day to Belfast and by reducing this number to allow them to work locally can produce a benefit for local businesses which is timely given the current climate, he said.ldquoThe Downshire Civic Centre is already a public sector hub and perhaps additional civil service jobs could be redeployed there in the future, providing Downpatrick with an additional boost..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Plans.jpg","title":"Plans for £25m petrol station in Ballynahinch  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH could be in line for a major jobs boost.Plans have been lodged to build a new petrol station at the junction of the Ballynahinch Road and Magheraknock Road as part of a pound.m investment that will create  new jobs.A development proposal for a vacant corner site lodged at the start of the month is seeking full permission to develop a new petrol station featuring eight pumps, convenience shop with deli counter, canopy and underground storage tanks.The proposal also features three electric vehicle charging points, car parking for  vehicles, a jet wash, play area, landscaping and site and access works.Planning papers confirm that the site will be accessed off the Magheraknock Road with the proposed development offering over  car parking spaces, four of which will be reserved for disabled drivers and another two for mothers and toddlers.The papers say that due to the ldquomodest scale of the development and low numbers of cars generated, it is not anticipated that the development will have any detrimental impact on noise and air quality of the surrounding environment.Planning permission for a filling station, shop and car wash was previously granted for the development site in , with the planning papers outlining the proposed play area will be located at the south western boundary of the site and lead to a new pedestrian connection from the site to an existing footpath along the Ballynahinch Road.This has been designed to allow children within surrounding residential developments to use the play equipment.The planning papers say previous planning permission for  square metres of retail space is insufficient to meet the needs of the local neighbourhood which is devoid of local retail provision.ldquoThe application represents an opportunity to redesign the layout to provide a modern style of development on a prominent site at the corner of the Magheraknock Road and Ballynahinch Road which will provide a convenient roadside facility for surrounding rural settlements and a local conveniencefor the immediate residential context, the papers continue.ldquoThe design and layout of the proposal is not uncharacteristic of that of a typical roadside facility and has been designed to to take full cognisance of the sitersquos constraints and to ensure there are limited negative amenity impacts on surrounding residential receptors.A needs assessment document submitted as part of the planning application argues that the area around the proposed development site ldquolacks a local neighbourhood facility to serve existing developments and those that will be developed in the future.In addition, the assessment argues that the proposal will have a ldquonegligible impact on like-for-like development within the catchment and convenience operators in Ballynahinch town centre.The assessment said it has demonstrated that there is a clear quantitative and qualitative need for the proposal to provide a much-needed service station and neighbourhood facility to serve the locality and wider rural settlements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Shimna.jpg","title":"Shimna College £16m work gets green light  ","story":"WORK is to start on Shimna

be completed in .The modern new three-storey school will be constructed to the east of the current main building at its sprawling Lawnfield site at King Street which will eventually be bulldozed.Included in the ambitious development plan are a range of new sports facilities which we will be shared with the Newcastle community.The new school proposal is being supported by the Department for Education and Integrated Education Fund with principal, Kevin Lambe, delighted that formal planning approval will be rubber-stamped by local councillors next week.Mr Lambe says the entire Shimna community is delighted that planning permission will go ahead for ldquoour wonderful new building.He said everyone was ldquoextremely excited that work on the new school will begin in the autumn term and that the new Year  students joining Shimna this September will be able to look forward to sitting their GCSEs and A levels in a purpose built, state-of-the art building.ldquoOf course, we have always been very proud of our current, semi-permanent building, which was begun in  mdash financed by parents on a bank loan mdash and which has grown with us through  years, Mr Lambe continued.ldquoIt will, in many ways, be a sad day to see that building come down. However, important though excellent facilities are, the core of a school is the student, staff, parent and governor body and they deserve a new building to match the commitment, enthusiasm and of course the Integrated ethos which drives this school.Mr Lambe thanked the Department of Education and the technical team behind the new school for the energy and creativity they have brought to the project.He also extended gratitude to Newry, Mourne and Down Council for addressing the schoolrsquos application for planning permission.Mr Lambe added: ldquoWe are particularly excited that the sports facilities for the new school will be shared with our local community and all the community partners who already meet in Shimna.Shimna College currently shares its sports halls, grounds and main building with a number of local groups and in  celebrated its th anniversary with its need for new accommodation one of a number of projects earmarked for financial support in the Fresh Start Agreement.The hugely successful integrated college opened in September  with just  pupils, but has since grown to become of Northern Irelandrsquos leading schools.However, the current school does not meet its needs or the standards specied in the current Department of Education Secondary School handbook.In February , education officials approved a development proposal to redevelop the integrated college to deliver a modern, post-primary school capable of accommodating the increased demand for integrated education in the area.The planning papers due to be formally approved next week outline a proposal to build ultra-modern accommodation to the east of the current school, with new sports accommodation extending to the west, encompassing part of the footprint of the existing school.A new single storey sports suite will extend from the schoolrsquos northwestern elevation of the new buildings and includes a hall, gym, fitness area and ancillary accommodation with the main school building intentionally designed to allow Shimna College to continue operating during construction work on the new-build.It is understood that phase one will focus on the construction of the main school building, excluding the proposed new sports provision. All of the existing school will be bulldozed when the new-build is complete, apart from the existing sports hall.It is believed that this part of the current post-primary building will only be razed to the ground when work on the new sports facilities have been completed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer action to make comeback  ","story":"LOCAL soccer clubs are in preparation after the resumption of training was given the green light.The Stormont Executive announced a plannedto training from April .Celtic Bhoys FC, Downpatrick and Killough FC are among the local clubs which have welcomed the news with open arms following a frustrating last few months.Celtic Bhoys FC have been working hard behind the scenes to prepare for training to take place at their newly built Ballyhornan facility.Club chairman Patrick Moore said: ldquoWe are really excited to be able to start afresh this season and make the most of our new state of the art G pitch and clubroom at Ballyhornan.ldquoWe will aim to maximise this as a community hub for local people and families throughout the coming year and we firmly believe this will provide a  for the club to grow and prosper in the post Covid- world.He continued: ldquoThere is no doubt that this has been an extremely dficult year for so many, particular those who have lost loved ones as a result of the pandemic.ldquoThe club is excited to have the opportunity to once again provide sporting and social activities to young and old in the local community.

For physical health and emotional health and wellbeing it is so important.”The club has , members, including  who play as well as social members.Players went out in pairs to play just nine holes instead of the full  so that as many members as possible could book a round.“Normally a round of golf has got four people, which is called a four ball, but because of the restrictions they are only playing two balls,” she said.“We’re only playing nine holes instead of the normal , and that’s to facilitate as many members as possible getting out.“The clubhouse is closed too. It is dferent, on a normal day we would have a lot more golfers but the restrictions allow just two people at a time.”At Hillmount Garden Centre, owner Robin Mercer was handling  click and collect orders and said he had to bring in extra staff to cope with the demand.“It’s OK for the supermarkets, they are geared up for click and collect, whereas our website is more general, for deliveries and letting people see what we have, so we have had to react very quickly.

It’s annoying when you see garden centres in England, Scotland and Wales open.“I can’t understand it.

We have heard that’ll be held up for another week or so,” he said.“In terms of Brexit we haven’t had a plant in from England at all this year, they relaxed the rules about the soil but none of the carriers are prepared to do it any more, so we’ve lost that whole opportunity.”There will be further relaxation of the coronavirus restrictions on April  with the Stay At Home message set to change to Stay Local.The final cohort of school pupils, secondary years eight to , will go back to classes, while up to  people from no more than two households can meet outdoors in a private garden and click and collect will resume at all non-essential retail outlets.Meanwhile, outdoor sports training will resume for sports clubs affiliated with recognised governing bodies with no more than  participants in one training group.

These test events are an integral stepping-stone to get the industry in Wales back working again .Sarah Hemsley-Cole, Director of Cardf based SC Productions and the Lead Coordinator for the campaign said: ldquoWhilst we have to accept large mass gatherings are not possible in  ndash it is essential that we keep up the pressure on Welsh Government to allow covid safe cultural activities in the Summer of .\"We are a creative and innovative sector, and by working with Welsh Government to develop appropriate guidance and to generate factual data and evidence from the test events, we can get performers, artists, technicians and the eco system back to work and audiences back to what they love.Working alongside partners such as Equity, Creu Cymru, BECTU, Cardf Music Board, Cult Cymru, Freelancers Make Theatre Work Freelances Task Force, What About Weddings and The Musicians Union ndash We Make Events Cymru has helped give the industry and events people a crucial voice during these unprecedented times.Following on from the recent budget announcement, We Make Events Cymru acknowledge the essential package of support already received from the UK and Welsh governments, and is pleased to hear of the further support expected with the extension of furlough, additional SEISS grants ndash which now includes newcomers to the industry who started their businesses in the   tax year, as well as the Cultural Recovery Fund.We Make Events Cymru are now waiting to hear about additional financial aid and get a better understanding of how long this relief money is expected to last business and iniduals in Wales.

Within it, Wales plays a signicant role with its tremendous highly skilled workforce, many of whom have now had to ersy to work in other jobs.The impact of the lockdown will be felt within the Welsh events industry for many years to come. Rhys Maule, Managing Director of ProLX Productions in Cwmbran said: ldquoThe loss of extremely talented, hard working and dedicated professionals is really hard to see.\"These people are being backed into a corner as a result of no support and canrsquot see any way out other than to change career and move onto something more secure. Lots of these people feel they may neveras the risk is too great, which is devastating, and the impact on their metal health as a result of this is hard to hear.He added ldquoThe huge number of people falling through the gaps not receiving funding is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency to ensure the future of our industry.The COVID- pandemic has caused many events around Wales and the UK to be cancelled or postponed due the government-imposed restrictions on large gatherings. Among the most prominent events to be affected in Wales in  have been the National Eisteddfod, the Royal Welsh Show, Hay Festival, Abergavenny Food Festival, Cardf Half Marathon, Llangollen International Eisteddfod, Green Man and Ironman.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The problem is thatrsquos what everyone is doing. It doesnrsquot look great at times. But what can we do ldquoOver Christmas it looked almost like a carnival atmosphere to be honest.ldquoIrsquod like to look on the bright side.

Itrsquos nice to see.That revival is continuing this weekend too as a new cafeacute opens inside the Pier Pavilion.The new rules mean the Pickfords can open their rooms to all people in Wales again.Hugh PickfordldquoWersquove not had much interest at the moment in the rooms, he said. ldquoPeople booked for April and then cancelled when they realised it was room service only. People donrsquot seem to want to eat off the premises or in their rooms, so thatrsquos hitting us a bit.ldquoWersquore looking forward to the summer. With staycation season likely to be ahead of us, it should be a great place to be.What you saidResidents have been responding when asked what they thought of the new changes.Jo Broad, from Blackwood, predicted: ldquoPeople will go crazy. Of course we need our lives back or at least some sort of normality. The beaches will be full again.ldquoLetrsquos hope people will be sensible, not go crazy, and letrsquos hope for safety, or I think there might be a summer lockdown coming.Newport resident Lisa Edwards said: ldquoPeople need to stop hiding behind the government. We are in charge of our own destiny and we have to resume some normality.ldquoTo do this, we need to be allowed to resume living, but sensibly.
