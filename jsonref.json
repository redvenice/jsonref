I just want to protect what I\u0027ve worked so hard for.\u0027We\u0027ve been in business for just over a year. It\u0027s been so successful.

There are a lot of cosmetics sold, there are a lot of fashion shows, there is a lot of promotional value for the cosmetic industry in New York.\u0027 Representatives of Kylie Jenner told DailyMailTV they had no comment. In July this year, Forbes magazine valued Jenner as being worth $900 million and said Kylie Cosmetics, which she founded in 2016, made up the majority of her fortune, valuing it at $800 million.Forbes predicted she would become richer while still 21, making her the world\u0027s youngest self-made billionaire.

It came to a head on Saturday and it wasn\u0027t ready so I stepped in.\u0027I have 15 years of children\u0027s theatre experience. I wanted to make it what it\u0027s supposed to be. Yesterday (Monday) was great, we had about 60 kids and every one had a smile. \u0027No parents said anything bad but we have had some bad Facebook comments, but they may have been from people who came on Saturday. We are still working on it and have had happy customers.\u0027We now have new equipment and events going on. Some of the things here require some level of imagination, so some parents may spot things that kids wouldn\u0027t.\u0027I feel like we\u0027re getting it to what it should be. We firmly believe if people come their kids will have a great time. \u0027If anyone wanted a refund we would give it. There\u0027s lots of stuff here and is good for all ages, and we\u0027ve had some real screams. We age range the activities.\u0027          In adverts for the event, pictured, it appeared to promise a much more scary adventure          Another advert, pictured, showed spooky looking webbing draped around a pathA number of customers have also complained on the Screamania event\u0027s Facebook page. Lauren Pritchard, said: \u0027This event is an absolute shambles to say the least! We arrived 10 minutes before our slot and were told they weren\u0027t quite ready, everyone running around like headless chickens!\u0027Health and safety was non existent, the event is nothing at all like advertised. From the advert you get the impression this will be a brilliant, exciting, immersive family experience....anti climax is definitely what I would go with!\u0027I could have organised something better and much cheaper in my back garden.

And Business Secretary Greg Clark also called for action on the tax.The Mail is campaigning for reforms that will give high street stores a level playing field with massive rivals such as Amazon.As well as the tax cut for hard-hit areas, Mr Hammond is also thought to have considered axing a quirk that means thousands of shops are paying more in rates than they should do.Every seven years, properties that pay business rates are revalued by a quango. If their value is estimated to have fallen, then the company occupying them is charged less rates. But this cut is introduced gradually over several years rather than in one go – meaning that in the meantime companies find themselves paying an artificially large amount of tax.The Chancellor could axe this downward transitional relief and pass on any rates cuts all in one go, easing the pressure on struggling firms.A Treasury spokesman said it did not comment on speculation on the Budget. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/00/4CF443F300000578-0-image-m-10_1528239659134.jpg","title":"Bottled water greatest consumer all","story":"    And new research has confirmed for the first time that our bodies are becoming \u0027polluted\u0027 with plastic.

The first documented example of a bottled non-alcoholic drink being sold was in Boston in the United States in the 1760s, when a company called Jackson\u0027s Spa started selling mineral water for \u0027therapeutic\u0027 uses.Other companies followed suit and a market was born.But the glass bottles used shared a problem: the metal caps imparted a foul taste to the content. In 1917, American inventor Webster Byron Baker made the first plastic bottle cap, by heating Celluloid and crimping it around the mouth of a bottle.It was the start of the plastics revolution that really took off in 1941 when British chemists at the Calico Printers\u0027 Association who were researching a new textile product, developed a form of plastic called polyethylene terephthalate (PET).Within 25 years, scientists working for the American chemical giant Du Pont had found a way of making PET strong enough to contain carbonated (fizzy) drinks without bursting. It was cheap, lighter than glass and virtually unbreakable.In 1978, Coca-Cola introduced the two-litre PET plastic bottle, which rapidly became the standard bottle material for fizzy drinks in all sizes.But there was a product that was far cheaper to make than sugary pop, and thus infinitely more profitable — fizzy water.The French spotted the potential and first perfected the trick of selling H20 at hugely marked-up prices — by marketing it as a \u0027natural\u0027 miracle — initially in a green glass bottle.          In 1977, a £4 million advertising campaign across America used Orson Welles to trumpet how \u0027Deep below the plains of southern France, in a mysterious process begun millions of years ago, Nature herself adds life to the icy waters of a single spring: Perrier\u0027.Suddenly, Perrier was the only drink to be seen sipping. Sales in the U.S. increased from 2.5 million bottles to more than 75 million bottles by the end of the following year — helped by the burgeoning craze for aerobics and healthy living — followed by rising sales in Europe.In 1985, Time magazine declared that \u0027water snobbery has replaced wine snobbery as the latest noon-hour recreation. People order their eau by brand name, as they once did Scotch\u0027.Within five years these two agents of the environmental apocalypse — water and plastic bottles — were being combined, and the big brands jumped aboard. PepsiCo launched Aquafina in 1994, Coca-Cola\u0027s Dasani emerged in 1999, and Nestlé\u0027s Pure Life in 2002.No matter that nearly a quarter of the bottled water being sold in America was actually filtered tapwater, the marketing departments were in hyperdrive, creating a liquid gold-rush.DumpedAny environmental worries were squashed underfoot. For example in 2008, in a masterpiece of \u0027greenwashing\u0027, Nestle declared that: \u0027Bottled water is the most environmentally responsible consumer product in the world.\u0027It added: \u0027Most water bottles avoid landfill sites and are recycled.\u0027Such claims were vigorously challenged by environmental groups, but to no effect.Over the past two decades, bottled water has become the fastest-growing drinks market in the world. The global market was valued at £120 billion in 2013 and is expected to reach £215 billion by 2020.Here in the UK we use about 38.5 million plastic bottles every day, driven largely by the bottled water craze, although other fizzy drinks and juice in plastic containers are a factor, too.And rather than being recycled, more than 15 million of these bottles are, each day, either incinerated, dumped in landfill or discarded on the land or seas where we know they can enter the human food chain via contamination of marine life.  Last year more than £3.1 billion was spent on buying 4,000 million litres of bottled water. Stock picture of Willow bottled waterIt is ironic that a product initially marketed as a boost to health has, through its association with plastic, become a threat to health. Even before the new findings by scientists at the Medical University of Vienna were published this week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) had announced a review into the potential risks of plastic in drinking water.This followed an analysis of some of the world\u0027s most popular bottled water brands which concluded that more than 90 per cent contained potentially harmful microplastic particles.Yet still we buy the stuff, proof that the power of marketing can trump the concerns of world-renowned scientists. According to Stephanie Cote, an environmental scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, bottled water is positioned as the \u0027elixir of youth\u0027, with which we can salve our instinctive fear of ageing and death.It might sound far-fetched but in her study, published earlier this year, she cites a 2013 Evian marketing campaign in which people are seen walking past a window and seeing themselves as babies in the reflection. Nestlé, meanwhile, used the phrase \u0027Drink Better. Live Better\u0027 in its Pure Life campaigns.The peddlers of bottled-water are also shameless in their use of pristine shots of snowy mountains and glacial lakes, implying a lack of pollution and ignoring the evidence of the harm that their products wreak on people and the environment.Other research has shown young people are influenced by advertising that associate bottled water with ultimate convenience — so convenient that they ignore the alarming reality, such as the fact that research shows 90 per cent of teenagers have gender-bending chemicals from plastic in their bodies.If ever there was a time to take stock, then it\u0027s now. But be in no doubt, there is a long way to go before we kick this expensive, pointless and lethal habit. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/23/22/5193E10A00000578-6308963-image-a-29_1540328720894.jpg","title":"Prince Harry leaves touching handwritten note Fijian wreath laying ceremony","story":"    Prince Harry wrote: \u0027In grateful memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their country.

Chinese newspapers hang behind him and down below, a cat walks towards him. This simple, charming photograph details the life of one Chinese immigrant – who has a hint of loneliness on his face.“New York City is a place where there’s millions of things happening, everyone lives their own story,” said An Rong Xu, the photographer. “Even when there are so many people around you, it could feel like the loneliest place.”This photo, and more, are in Interior Lives: Contemporary Photographs of Chinese New Yorkers, a new exhibit opening at the Museum of the City of New York on 26 October, which traces the lives of Chinese New Yorkers through the eyes of three New York photographers: Xu alongside Thomas Holton and Annie Ling.“I’m drawn to loneliness,” said Xu. “Loneliness is one of the most commonly shared emotions among humans a lot of my family history involved one of us leaving China to pursue dreams in America. So, in one way or another, the isolation and loneliness to pursue your dreams are ingrained in me.”The exhibit features roughly 60 photos of the Chinese community living in New York, from Chinatown natives to first-generation Americans, those who arrived from the 1960s onward to the new wave of immigrants. The images have been selected by MCNY’s photography curator, Sean Corcoran. “Immigration is one of the stories that is told in each of the photographer’s works, in different capacities,” said Corcoran. “Another point is the idea of community, home and how we make home through communities we build.”New York is the city with the largest Chinese population outside of Asia with an estimated 573,388 people recorded in 2014. “This exhibit is not a comprehensive look at life inside this community,” he said. “It’s meant to shine a light on the personal lives of Chinese New Yorkers and recognize how much they contribute to our city, which is overlooked in American culture.”He explains Chinese immigration to America almost doubled between 1980 and 1990, and again between 1990 and 2000. “The Chinese community has exploded here in New York City,” he said. “A lot of people make the association to Chinatown but we are trying to show they live everywhere in the city. They participate in all aspects in life, from working in restaurants to banking.”Xu’s photos look at the everyday lives of Chinese Americans through a quiet, cinematic lens. His series covers everything from Chinese barber shops to beauty queens, marching bands and teenagers hanging out in the park.“In New York, I feel Chinese Americans have created a community for themselves, that at times is welcoming and at other times, isolating,” said Xu. “I look at how we’re surrounded by each other and yet all have our own inidual stories to tell.”Xu’s photos also seem to challenge well-worn stereotypes about Chinese Americans. “He is combating racism in his work, combating the idea that Chinese immigrants only work in Chinese restaurants,” said Corcoran. “He shows whole careers and cultural standpoints of how Chinese immigrants can absorb the local culture and made it their own, while combining it with their own culture they’ve grown up with.”The exhibit also features the photos of Taipei-born photographer Annie Ling, who documented the day-to-day lives of residents living in 81 Bowery, a defunct lodging house that offered cheap, often cramped housing for labor workers and Chinatown kitchen staff.“It’s about the complexities of immigration and the American dream,” said Corcoran. “It shows the sacrifices some people are willing to make for their families and their futures.”Meanwhile, New York photographer Thomas Holton shows a series based on one family he photographed for over a decade, the Lams, who carved out their lives in a 350-sq-ft apartment on Ludlow Street.“Ultimately, I think the Lams work is not about being Chinese American or specifically Chinese New Yorkers, but about family and the ups and downs families across the globe go through,” said Holton. “Life is not so easily scripted, it’s full of drama, which I believe everybody can relate to.”From kitchen meals to snoozing on the sofa and playing video games, viewers can watch the Lam children grow up and move onto other chapters in their lives, like college.“One theme in the series is growing apart but its more about the power of family and creating home, even when the home doesn’t work in ways expected,” said Holton. “What I have learned the most from this project is that life can, truthfully, be quite messy. I have a young son now, so I realize how important it is for me to be there for him and help him navigate the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0505c6e1bad73b98e5faf0d56f062cc2f85c2be3/434_189_1786_1071/master/1786.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48f5767a68c1f86ca8068cbe66f18745","title":"graffiti homages to hip hop heroes in pictures","story":"In homage to the early 80s, when graffiti and rapping were inextricably linked, British photographer Janette Beckman asked some of the world’s most important street artists to reinterpret her archive photographs of hip-hop legends• Janette Beckman: The Mash-Up is at FaheyKlein Gallery, Los Angeles, until 24 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e4eb17c52176cf3c481398e9e4b52ba3667d0d1/0_303_4332_2599/master/4332.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7e7a6ce9161b4c501d552c57d55ef57","title":"booker winner milkman defies challenging bestseller anna burns","story":"Anna Burns’s novel sold almost 10,000 copies in the first days after the prize, and Faber has printed 120,000 additional copies to meet demandDespite being described by the chair of the Man Booker prize judges as “challenging”, Anna Burns’s story of sexual intimidation during the Troubles, Milkman, has proved a hit with readers, its sales soaring in the first days after winning the prize.Already the second bestselling title on the shortlist before the prize was announced last Tuesday, Milkman racked up sales of 9,466 copies in the four days to Saturday, according to book sales monitor Nielsen BookScan, and now sits in ninth place in The Bookseller’s Top 50, ahead of titles by Ian Rankin, Tina Turner and Joanna Trollope. The previous week, it had sold 963 copies, with around 5,000 copies sold altogether. Her publisher, Faber, has reprinted 120,000 copies since to meet demand, bringing the total number of copies of Milkman in print to 180,000.Burns herself dismissed widespread descriptions of her novel as challenging, telling Channel 4: “I can’t see what the difficulty is myself.” At Waterstones, fiction buyer Bea Carvalho said the novel had been performing well.“Its central themes are so timely and relevant today that it promises to be a thought-provoking and rewarding read to anyone who might otherwise have found it a challenging proposition: we’re really pleased that the prize will encourage all kinds of readers to get stuck in.”Burns, who claimed benefits while writing Milkman, thanks a Sussex housing charity and a food bank as well as the Department for Work and Pensions in the acknowledgments to Milkman. She ends with thanks to friends and strangers for the “many gifts and much assistance” she has received over the years. “I look forward to throwing one hell of a party one day to say thanks to them all, but not yet, as they would have to pay for it.”“I couldn’t finish my book for quite a while. I thought I’d finish it in three weeks but it took 10 months. After that, my money was gone,” she told Channel 4 earlier this week, adding that she would now be declaring her £50,000 prize win to the DWP. “I’ve got 30 days to declare a change in circumstances and this is one hell of a change in circumstances so I will be declaring that … it’s just been a bit busy,” she said.At Faber, publisher Alex Bowler said that it had been “a beautiful, joyous week for all of us at Faber, witnessing first-hand what happens when the full transformative force of the Booker is focused on a work of art somehow perfectly fitted to our times, to this very moment”.“There has been an important debate generated by Milkman’s win — discussions about the role of the novel and the way we, as a culture and society, treat and represent our writers,” said Bowler. “For Anna’s novel to have instantly cracked the Top 10 in both physical and ebook, for there to already be 180,000 copies in print across all editions, is just stunning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d15f9a410a13b56a58bddbfefd654a7db9e6fcfd/0_275_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89dea75505faef782aad0f18d6c263b7","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, EstelleMoon, who has had a disappointingly fulfilling experience:Well, as much as I’d like to say I’ve been reading something esoteric and obscure, no, I’ve been reading something incredibly popular. And as much as I’d like to say that the popular thing is overrated and bad, no, in fact, it turns out it’s incredibly popular and incredibly good.I’m talking about Elena Ferrante. I finished My Brilliant Friend a couple of days ago, and I’m now about 100 pages into Volume 2 of her Neapolitan Quartet, The Story of a New Name. They’re so vivid and rich when it comes to detailing this beautiful, frustrating and profound friendship between Elena and Lila, full of love, full of competition, full of resentment, full of life. But they’re also a portrait of a community, of a country coming from fascism, they’re about the urge to break away from the stifling world you grew up in, they’re about masculinity, about family, about politics and so much more – but all these heady themes emerge in the best way possible – ie, organically, through the story and the lives of Elena and Lila.Oh well. Elsewhere, julian6 has enjoyed Mario Vargas Llosa’s early book, The Time of the Hero:This account of the daily struggles and cruelties at a military academy in Peru has sharply etched characters and wonderfully economical descriptive work. Llosa plays with time sequences throughout, moving back and forth, slowly drawing out the painful life journeys of his characters. It is clear-eyed, unsentimental and unfailingly honest, showing its vulnerable, petty, vindictive but not entirely irredeemable protagonists in a raw uncompromising light. The translation brought out the fluency of phrasing, the choice vocabulary. These narrators - for there are many viewpoints in this work, as well as third person - know their world intimately. I was drawn in from the beginning. The sympathy that emerged was never pleaded for or crudely awakened. There is nothing cheap in Llosa’s vision - it is a naked portrayal of diminished lives caught in an unforgiving web of poverty, prejudice and pitiless power structures.A second reading of Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman has impressed Ieuan:Very similar to War and Peace (which was its inspiration – and of similar length and complexity). The manuscript was confiscated by the KGB upon writing and Grossman was told it couldn’t be published for ‘at least 200 years’. A copy was smuggled to the west in the 1980s and published here. It was hailed a masterpiece and (IMHO), it is.The Power by Naomi Alderman gets a nod from koelner:I just finished reading and it absolutely blew me away. I didn’t necessarily agree with how things developed (ie that it would really work out like that if it happened in real life) but it was just so clever, especially the letters between authors at the end. I finished it and immediately had the urge to write an essay on it like back when I was in school. I mean, I didn’t, but there was just so much to think about and comment on and discuss. It really fired my imagination. It would be such a good book to study at school. Really enjoyed it.Meanwhile, The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has worked for scoopster35:Greene puts you exactly in his world – peasant Mexico, in this case – with no fuss, no flowery prose, just hard, clear, vivid writing.RedmonT recommends The End of Vandalism by Tom Drury:It’s hilarious. Rare indeed that I laugh out loud from a book but I have done several times already. There’s something tragic about it, too.Here’s paulburns on Richard Flanagan’s Death of a River Guide:During an expedition down the Franklin River in northwest Tasmania, Aljaz Cosini, the expedition’s guide, drowns in an attempt to rescue a punter who has fallen into the raging rapids. As he drowns he recalls not only his own life, but the lives of several generations of his relatives, one of whom is a Tasmanian Aborigine. (For those who don’t know, Tasmanian Aborigines are a different type of indigenous people to the mainland Indigenous Australians), and another a convict, whose relatives are ashamed of the ‘convict stain’. At the same time, Flanagan writes in detail and lovingly of travelling down the Franklin River (not the safest thing in the world to do) in a journey beset by tragedy. This is a fine, beautifully written book.I am reading Harry Potter again, this time with my grandson. He is the same age his mum was when the first book was published,when we found it in the library, well before it became A Thing.

The contents of the database are being kept secret from the public, and the government said it was “not in the public interest” to explain why.Convicted landlords judged unfit, but who are still in business, include:• Bernard McGowan, a rogue landlord who boasts of a £30m property empire, and who has been convicted six times of housing offences since 2014. He has failed the “fit and proper” landlord test in Brent, north London, but McGowan properties continue to be rented out there, in the other London boroughs of Camden and Newham, and in Hertfordshire.• Gary Fixter, described as a “despicable” landlord by a local councillor after being convicted of housing offences in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, in 2016. He was convicted again in Wirral in April this year, when he was told by a judge to “give up” renting out property because of the “totally unacceptable” conditions in his homes. Since then he has been renting out properties in Chester and Wirral.• Adrian Webb, a former firefighter convicted of renting out a Liverpool property that breached fire regulations in 2016, who has failed the city council’s fit and proper person test. He is currently renting out property in neighbouring St Helens, where he was also successfully prosecuted in 2016 for failing to deal with damp and mould in one of his properties.• David McGuinness, a landlord who rented out a home described as a “shed in the back garden of a shabbily converted bedsit property” in 2012 and who is one of 28 iniduals Newham says it has “banned” after failing the council’s fit and proper person test. McGuinness owns property in Ilford which is licensed by the neighbouring London borough of Redbridge to be rented out by a third-party agent.• Katia Goremsandu, once dubbed the “country’s worst landlord”, who has been convicted on multiple occasions. Goremsandu has now been banned from managing homes in two London boroughs – Westminster and Haringey – under legislation usually used to control gang members or prolific drug offenders. She continues to own property in London that is rented out to tenants and someone is occupying a luxury flat she owns in Kensington, west London.Under the existing legislation, a landlord can fail the fit and proper person test in one borough but continue legally renting out properties in other boroughs.The law also allows landlords to continue renting out homes in the borough where they are banned so long as they are managed by an approved third party. Failing a fit and proper person test does not mean that all or any of the landlord’s properties are unfit.The licensing of landlords was introduced as part of the Housing Act, which came into force in 2006 and was billed as a way of forcing rogue landlords to clean up their acts. It gave councils the power to refuse a landlord a licence if the local authority did not deem them to be a fit and proper person to rent out property to tenants.In order to decide whether a landlord is fit and proper, the legislation says local authorities must consider whether “the landlord has] contravened any provision of the law relating to housing or of landlord and tenant law”. However, it is rare for councils to judge that a landlord is not fit and proper. and ITV News’ findings have prompted experts to question whether local authorities have the resources to use existing laws, as well as recently enhanced enforcement powers.“We see licences being issued even where a landlord has had previous convictions so shouldn’t reasonably be deemed to be a fit and proper person as the law requires. Even if he is prevented from holding a licence in one area, there’s a good chance he will be operating somewhere else.”One leading housing academic said legislation governing the country’s private rented sector needed a complete overhaul.Julie Rugg, a senior research fellow at the University of York’s Centre for Housing Policy who co-authored a study published last month on England’s private rented sector, said the legislation needed a complete overhaul: “There is a lot to be said for saying: ‘You know what, can we just start again?’“The more new legislation comes in, the chances of it not working in practice, with all the other legislation that’s in play, increases.“At the moment, everyone is agreed that nothing is working.”The University of York’s study found that 250,000 families in England were bringing up babies and infants in privately rented accommodation that failed to meet the decent homes standard.Decent homes must be free of the most serious safety hazards. The current standard, which is used across government as a measure of adequate living conditions, was introduced in 2006.Homes must also be in a reasonable state of repair and have acceptable kitchen and bathroom facilities.More than one in four homes in the private rented sector fall below the decent standard.The scale of that finding suggests the private rented sector is blighted by more than just a small minority of rogue operators.The authors of the research back the introduction of a “property MOT” – like the system that exists for cars – in which all properties let for residential purposes would need an annual standardised inspection by approved experts.Since 2013, landlord licensing schemes have expanded, but they vary hugely across the country, and even within the same local authority area there can be less stringent licence requirements in certain wards.In addition to licensing, new legislation was introduced in April this year that could lead to the most serious offenders being banned from renting out property anywhere in England.Heather Wheeler MP, the minister for housing and homelessness, said: “Everyone deserves a decent and safe place to live, and we are reforming the private rented sector to make it fairer for all.“Through fines, banning orders and the new rogue landlord database – warmly welcomed by councils – we have provided authorities with new enforcement tools to help them crack down on the minority of landlords who exploit tenants.”Eleanor Southwood, a councillor and cabinet member for housing and welfare reform in Brent, said: “We are appalled by the way Mr McGowan consistently failed to meet standards, which resulted in our two convictions against him. We take the rights of tenants incredibly seriously. We work with all landlords because this is the best way to ensure that their tenants are protected.”McGowan did not respond to requests for comment and when approached outside his Hertfordshire office by the  and ITV News, he hid in a cafe toilet for half an hour to avoid questions and called a taxi to pick him up outside.Webb, who was ruled not fit and proper by Liverpool council, said: “I formally request that you do not bring myself and family any more upset on this matter by reporting this. I was a victim of circumstances and it has caused me much hardship in many ways. I am trying to put this behind me.”Fixter, McGuinness and Goremsandu did not respond to efforts to contact them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/482c0a6cb4e495b18370fe8213527ee5dc41d6dc/0_28_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93c81d86e4d4747eb68d822e7d85fbba","title":"the guardian view on the daily mail and brexit a very public shift","story":"A new editor has abandoned the aggressive tone with which the Mail campaigned for Brexit. This reflects a change in the public moodAs a rule, it is a mistake for the press to write about itself. Journalists will always find journalism fascinating. But readers are not nearly so interested in media navel-gazing. If newspapers spent each day analysing one another, readers would rapidly lose interest, and rightly so. Yet the editorial in today’s Daily Mail about the Tory party and Brexit is such a striking change of course that an exception to normal self-restraint is in order.The headline on its leader – “Saboteurs endangering the nation” – may have seemed like normal Daily Mail fare. This was the newspaper, after all, which in its “Who will speak for England?” headline in 2016 pushed David Cameron aside and placed itself firmly at the head of the leave campaign which used stories like “Plans to let 1.5m Turks into Britain” to make leave’s final push explicitly anti-migrant which charged Britain’s impartial judges with being “Enemies of the people” for ruling that parliament was sovereign in the Brexit process which welcomed Theresa May’s 2017 election launch with a call to “Crush the saboteurs” and which, under the snarling headline “Proud of yourselves?”, excoriated 11 Tory MPs who backed a meaningful vote on Brexit for their “treachery”.Yet the tone and, in particular, the focus of this morning’s leader were, in fact, very different from that confident in-your-face era. Instead of firing up the Brexiters for yet another act of anti-European contempt and defiance, as it had done for so long, the Mail this week turned its fire on them instead. It denounced the “arch-Brexiteers” for their “self-promotion and peacocking” and their efforts to undermine Mrs May. Former Mail heroes like Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis and Mr Johnson were dismissed as “vulgar bit-part players” and “back-stabbing plotters”, compared unfavourably with Brexit secretary Dominic Raab – “grown in stature” – and above all Mrs May, “the only person” who can secure an “acceptable outcome” and “sensible deal”.Such language is not just a media milestone. It is also a political one. The Mail is in many ways what it was from the start in 1896: a very brilliant newspaper. But at many points in its history – from Lord Northcliffe’s warmongering before and after 1914, through its publication of the Zinoviev letter forgery in the 1920s to discredit Labour, to its support for fascism under Lord Rothermere in the 1930s, it has also been a reckless political protagonist. So it has been, once again, in our own time. The Mail has been a propagandist for Brexit and for a radical reactionary Tory tradition that looks back to empire and Margaret Thatcher as its guiding lights. The rage and aggression that marked its advocacy of Brexit were absolutely in the Northcliffe tradition. But, like him, they left an indelible mark for the worse in politics and public life. The shockingly violent remarks by Tory MPs about Mrs May this week are part of this legacy. So is the gross Brexit-derived insult to the family of a seriously sick child by Mr Davis’s former chief of staff this week.The easy explanation for this shift would be to attribute it to the new editor, Geordie Greig, who replaced Paul Dacre last month after a 26-year reign. That is a big factor. But the deeper reason is that the national mood is changing. Brexit is becoming a burden on Britain. Doubts about the future are deepening. Last Saturday, parts of middle Britain to which the Mail does not speak took to the streets against Brexit. Today, police leaders, medicine distributors and scientists were the latest to voice Brexit concerns. Meanwhile the cabinet went on squabbling at home and Liam Fox continued chasing a fantasy trade deal with Donald Trump abroad.Fanatics are often the last to see that their dreams have turned to nightmares. But the British public, who are not fanatics, get it. So, belatedly, does a Mail that drove so hard to the cliff edge. The message has yet to reach many Tories. But they risk being swept aside if it doesn’t. The hard Brexiters are on the run."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a30868ba078649ebbbc07f9cf53409dad6b2d42/0_72_4901_2940/master/4901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3df32a0e63d83ebfa85bfc20adf14329","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of hidden","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘hidden’The closing date is Wednesday 24 October at 10am.

The move came a little more than a week after the process was restarted in the UK for the first time since it was banned in 2011.Cuadrilla Resources, which is carrying out the operations at its Preston New Road site, confirmed it paused work early on Tuesday as a precaution because of the microseismic event, which was measured at a magnitude of 0.4 and within the limit allowed by UK authorities.“This is an extremely low level of seismicity, far below what could possibly be felt at the surface but classed as an amber event as part of the traffic light system in place for monitoring operational activity,” the company said on Tuesday evening.“As such, we are required to reduce the rate we are pumping fracturing fluid once it has been detected. In fact, we have adopted extra caution and have stopped pumping for the day.”Campaigners have expressed concern that fracking, which involves directing liquid at high pressure at subterranean rocks to open up fissures and release oil or gas for extraction, causes earthquakes.After fracking restarted last Friday, the British Geological Survey recorded a series of small tremors. The process was stopped in the UK in 2011 after two earthquakes, one reaching a magnitude of 2.3, were triggered in close proximity to the site of shale gas test drilling. A subsequent report found that it was highly probable that the fracking operation caused the tremors.According to the British Geological Survey, Tuesday’s seismic event was the sixth detected in the area since fracking restarted. It was also the largest of the six, though still undetectable on the surface.Under the traffic light system of the Oil and Gas Authority, the UK regulator, a firm is required to stop fracking if any activity greater than 0.5 on the local magnitude scale, defined as a red alert, is detected. Any activity from 0.0 to 0.5 is defined as an amber alert and requires firms to proceed with caution.In its statement, Cuadrilla said: “Seismicity will, as always, continue to be monitored closely around the clock by ourselves and others and we plan to continue hydraulic fracturing again in the morning.“Local residents should be reassured that the monitoring systems in place are working as they should. These are tiny seismic events that are being detected by our monitors, as we fracture the shale rock, and are not capable of being felt, much less cause damage or harm. Regulators have been informed.”Gail Hodson, of the campaign group Frack Free Lancashire, said: “It is only what we’ve been expecting as it is an undisputed consequence of extreme energy extraction.“It highlights the fact that all the regulation in the world, even if it was gold standard, cannot stop seismic activity. The traffic light system was cooked up as a salve to try to reassure the public and those reassurances have come to nothing. The government should place a ban on fracking with immediate effect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b968010370ce82c46b386b93d7f94fc533768b88/1_1_2424_1454/master/2424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6b611cea058e23f68437ecfe9ff13d2","title":"fashions quirky new silhouettes catwalks high street","story":"The catwalks were full of unexpected volume this season, and the high street has followed suit. Here’s how to dress like a lampshade, while keeping your coolThe autumnwinter catwalks were all about making statements with shape. From clothes that were mildly bulky to outright bulging, and maximalist top-halves contrasting with streamlined bottom halves, designers took the opportunity to turn up the volume. It might, at first glance, seem impractical, but think again: there are tips and tricks to be taken from the collections that fuse function with fashion. You don’t have to follow this ethos to the letter instead, it can be easily replicated, or subtly nodded to, with high-street offerings this season.This silhouette is about being cocooned up top and streamlined below. Alessandro Michele’s froufrou creation at Gucci encapsulated it best on the runway, and the look has been mirrored in myriad faux-fur and shearling options on the high street, including River Island’s cropped red jacket (now £60). The bomber jacket trend – spearheaded by brands such as Marques Almeida, Sacai and Undercover at the shows – achieves the same effect with a streetwear sensibility. Asos, Topshop and Boy London have great variations ranging from £16 to £170. Far from fluid, this silhouette is one that you can have fun with, but it will need to be balanced with simplicity below the waist – think jeans or a pencil skirt – for all the style but with none of the sting. SCWe are not suggesting you take your cue from the lighting department, rather the similar and super-flattering silhouette created by a cape. Possibly this season’s most popular outerwear trend, thanks to its throw-on-and-go credentials and a certain Duchess of Sussex wearing one on tour in Australia this week, the cape came swooping down the runways at Alexander McQueen, Fendi and Erdem. Our favourite interpretation was at Givenchy, where Clare Waight Keller morphed her take on the trend with a trench coat, which everyone knows is the most versatile item to own. \u0026amp Other Stories has a beautiful belted style for £129, which we are banking on being the most worn item in our wardrobe this winter. SCDressing like a member of the allium family might not sound desirable, but this silhouette lends itself to practical autumnal dressing. It is all about layering, perfect for peeling off in\u0026nbspfluctuating temperatures or when you are speeding from footpath to bus. The look was big at Balenciaga, where models wore oversized anoraks over faux-fur jackets and big jumpers. Comme des Garçons (ever the champion of a millefeuille) and Maison Margiela also offered its own versions. Layering like this is ideal for eking out the life of summer-y jackets (no need to put your favourite denim jacket into hibernation just yet) or for breathing new life into last year’s padded jackets – wear one under an oversized blazer or overcoat when the sun goes down.

Not only did the film’s box office – it culled a worldwide total of $700m, making it the highest-grossing horror film of all time – kick off a renewed interest in King’s oeuvre, it also bestowed an air of prestige upon his onscreen horror output not seen since 1990’s Misery.Obviously, this guaranteed that the next several years would feature a number of new King adaptations, many of which would probably cover material previously brought to screen. Sure enough, a new Pet Sematary (previously adapted in 1989) is due in April next year, while It: Chapter II is scheduled to finish principal production soon. A host of other King properties are currently in various stages of development, including new iterations of Creepshow, Firestarter, The Tommyknockers, The Stand and even The Dark Tower (the first version having bombed in theaters only a month before It’s release last summer).The likelihood that any of these might match the success of It is a long shot (a properly epic version of The Stand probably stands the best chance), and post-Halloween, there are similar doubts over lightning striking twice.All too predictably, studios have begun scrambling to resurrect their own dormant slasher franchises in the hopes of riding its coattails. Fittingly, the first such property to be rumored for an imminent return is the original Halloween rip-off, Friday the 13th. This time, the summer camp zombie slasher will be reportedly summoned back to life by none other than newly arrived Los Angeles transplant LeBron James.Meanwhile, the Halloween producer (and reigning king of horror) Jason Blum has expressed interest in relaunching late-90s horror properties Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.Along those same lines, we can probably expect a number of IPs from the original Halloween writer-director John Carpenter to see some traction, including the long-gestating remakes of Escape From New York, They Live and Big Trouble in Little China (which, last we had heard, had Dwayne Johnson attached to star). Carpenter himself is certainly welcoming of the prospect.To many observers, both within the horror fan community and without, this latest emphasis on revitalizing properties with strong brand-name recognition is an annoying prospect, considering how little removed we are from the last time the trend was in full swing.Retreaded properties have flooded the market for years, and they were especially pervasive during the mid-aughts, which saw Rob Zombie’s pair of controversial Halloween remakes four new Texas Chainsaw Massacre films one attempt each at relaunching the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street brands and a host of other examples, including Dawn of the Dead, The Evil Dead, The Thing, My Bloody Valentine, Prom Night, The Stepfather, Carrie and more. So much more. (This doesn’t even take into account the various American remakes of foreign horror films during that same period.)The deluge hasn’t been limited to horror, nor has it been restricted to the multiplexes. From Robocop to Roseanne, the tide of nostalgia has flowed unbroken since the start of the millennium. It’s not as though there was ever a time this wasn’t par for the course – many beloved Hollywood classics, including The Wizard of Oz, Ben Hur and The Maltese Falcon, could be considered remakes – but they’re more prevalent now than at any previous point throughout cinema history.The question in the wake of Halloween 2018 (the 10th film in the franchise and its fourth – arguably fifth – attempt at rebooting itself) isn’t will we see a ton of franchise remakes and reboots, but what should we expect from them? Much like the Stephen King adaptations set to follow It, it is doubtful that Halloween’s particular success can be fully replicated. To pretend otherwise is to discount the specific alchemy of the film – a long enough gestation time since the last go-round, the highly anticipated return of its original star, a ready-made holiday tie-in date, and an emphasis on timely sociopolitical themes all helped the film capture the current zeitgeist, to say nothing of the box office.Any film might find some small measure of success by copying one or two of those elements – a new Nightmare on Elm Street with Robert England back in the role of Freddy Krueger might bring out more people than the last reboot (which saw Jackie Earle Haley step into the stripped sweatshirt, brown fedora, and knife glove), but the there’s nothing to suggest that it would make for a record-setting opening weekend. The same can be safely assumed for the return of any of his fellow slashers – Leatherface, Pinhead, even Jason (unless perhaps LeBron James were to put on the hockey mask himself). The recent failure of the Predator reboot proved that monsters alone won’t bring out the audience. When it comes to a true crossover horror success, we require a human element. Just look at the horror films that find mainstream respectability – Psycho, Rosemary’s Baby, The Exorcist, Carrie, Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense, Get Out – they all focused as much on the vulnerable people at their center as they did the monsters in their shadows. When it comes to Halloween, both the original (which was the highest-grossing independent film of its time) and the new one, the most human element to its shared success is Jamie Lee Curtis.Along those lines, if, say, Jodie Foster were to star alongside Anthony Hopkins in a new Hannibal Lecter movie, that might match (or even exceed) Halloween’s triumph. Likewise, a returning Sigourney Weaver could help steer the Alien franchise back on course after the recent disappointment of Prometheus and Covenant. Neither example is likely to happen at this point (until earlier this year, Weaver actually had been attached to star in an Alien reboot, which would have seen District 9 director Neill Blomkamp take the reins and which, like the new Halloween, would have jettisoned almost the entirety of the preceding sequels from the official canon), although both seem more plausible now than they did a week ago. Next year’s forthcoming Terminator reboot, which will bring back original stars Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger, should make for a good yardstick to test this specific template.Regardless of the inidual success or failure of any of these examples – both hypothetical and forthcoming – the future of horror is going to be rife with remakes, reboots, re-imaginings, sequels, prequels, second (or third, or fourth) adaptations and, of course, rip-offs galore.While in-and-of itself that’s lamentable, not least of all because it will only make it harder for original ideas to get produced and seen, it isn’t entirely cause for despair. As shown by recent reboots such as Mad Max: Fury Road, Creed and Twin Peaks: The Return, any one has the potential to show us exceed our expectations, and even to show us something original.Horror fans have been well aware of this for decades, as a handful of the all-time great films within the genre – James Whale’s Frankenstein, Werner Herzog’s Nosferatu, Philip Kaufman’s Invasion of the Body Snatchers, David Cronenberg’s The Fly, John Carpenter’s The Thing, and dare I say Luca Guadagnino’s excellent new Suspiria – are themselves remakes of one sort or another.Such artistic successes are few and far between, and they are always impossible to predict. What’s not impossible to predict is how the majority of horror remakes and reboots will turn out: several will play well with the general public, and make decent enough coin to warrant a direct sequel or two. Diehard horror fans will keep an open mind and catch everything that comes their way, while casual fans and critics will lament the lack of smart, original horror offerings, despite the numerous examples that come out on the regular (this year’s batch – Annihilation, A Quiet Place, Hereditary, Apostle and Mandy – has proven especially strong).Eventually, the most persistent franchises will wear out their welcome and be put to rest … at least until someone new comes along a few years down the line to once again resurrect Michael Myers or one of his murderous ilk, at which point the cycle, much like the mayhem that follows these tried-and-true monsters from film to film, will begin all over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21a0b521ad59a847a29f361eba56c1581443ab65/451_161_3074_1844/master/3074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08823ed3fb3285f68d341d7b24f4a1fa","title":"the man with the exploding head the director inspired by his medical condition","story":"When acclaimed Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul discovered he had ‘exploding head syndrome’, he let the condition feed into the film about trauma and memory he was making with Tilda SwintonAPichatpong Weerasethakul’s house in northern Thailand is a luscious jungle paradise full of polished concrete and teak, palm trees and bamboo. Even the air smells zen. The house’s three gatekeepers, Dracula, King Kong and Vampire, do little to disturb the peace. They are pugs – named because Weerasethakul loves horror movies – who have a proclivity for tenderly licking human toes, further adding to the sense of being biblically cleansed on arrival.Weerasethakul, 49, is filled with the same soft stillness that pervades his films. In 2010, the director won the Palme d’Or at Cannes for his eerie mouthful of a film Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives. His 2015 follow-up Cemetery of Splendour won huge critical acclaim. Equally embraced by the film and art worlds, he has just been announced as a nominee for this year’s Artes Mundi prize, the UK’s biggest award for international contemporary art.It can be easy to categorise his work as magical realism, existing in a blurred mythical space between waking and sleeping, where ghosts of Thai spirits and ancient Laotian princesses communicate with the modern mortal world and no one bats an eyelid. But for most Thais, this ancient belief in a powerful world of spirits and ghosts is almost universally accepted as a part of daily life. Offerings to spirit beings are can be found on every street corner.Weerasethakul’s work partly explores a tussle between the superstitions instilled in him as a child and what he describes as his “rational beliefs”. “Even though I approach the world scientifically, I cannot shake off the feeling of having spirits around,” he says. “I feel that when I’m with the green landscape I can always communicate with the trees, with the memory of the jungle and also with myself.”Weerasethakul says his films are about peeling back all of these elements of Thai society, exposing them in his gentle yet unforgiving way. “There are so many layers of truth, of reality, in this country,” he says. “It’s modernising so fast, but when it comes to freedom of expression, nothing has changed in 50 years. This country is so repressive, but is also very liveable – and I’m fascinated by that contrast.”His work is more subversive than it might first appear. His interest in sleep comes in part from the fact that it remains a realm of defiance, untouched by the creeping tentacles of Thai censorship. All films in Thailand are vetted by the military government, and while heavy-handed censorship exists across the arts, it is enforced most strongly in cinema.“Being here you cannot talk on certain topics, especially when it comes to the military,” he says. “Self-censorship is automatic.” Weerasethakul knows “so many artists” who have clashed with the authorities. After the release of his 2006 film Syndromes and a Century was postponed in Thailand because of scenes deemed inappropriate – such as a monk playing a guitar – he talked to the ministry of culture to try to encourage it to introduce an age-certification system, which would mean more explicit films wouldn’t simply be banned outright. But his suggestion fell on deaf ears.His mounting frustration with the system has driven him to make his first feature film outside Thailand. Memoria is about to start filming in Colombia and stars Tilda Swinton. “The last few years working in Thailand, it’s been about trying to be subversive. But I can only go so far.”Like Weerasethakul’s previous works, Memoria was developed through interviews with local people. As he was researching it, Weerasethakul developed “exploding head syndrome”, a disorienting condition when a person experiences loud noises and flashes of light on waking. As a result, he focused his interviews on doctors and psychologists, digging into ideas of trauma, suffering and memory. Casting Swinton in the lead role was born out of a long desire the pair had to work together. She was originally meant to play the lead in Cemetery of Splendour, before Weerasethakul decided it felt “somehow wrong” to include a non-Thai “outsider” in the film. They chose Colombia as the location for Memoria: “We are both foreigners there.”Weerasethakul has not given up on Thailand. He hopes to kickstart a documentary film movement in the country, and one day make a slasher movie there – possibly a remake of Grizzly, his favourite of the genre. But politically, even with an election due in February, Weerasethakul struggles to be optimistic. He says people have “given up” and considers the current Thai prime minister, Prayut Chan-ocha – who has released several pop singles while in power, the most recent one a Valentine’s Day ballad, Diamond Heart – to be “a joke”.“Five years ago I was really positive, but now I don’t have much hope for anything to happen in my lifetime,” Weerasethakul says with a sigh. “In Thailand, nothing changes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f923737b35945cda58e8b993d00ecfc223356757/0_146_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3681e1e8461aace14f53235659472eb","title":"manchester united juventus champions league match report","story":"There was a time when Old Trafford would lap up these nights. Manchester United v Juventus: it was more than just a football match, it was an occasion. Except those were the days when the players in red could hold their own against the most accomplished opponents. The days when it felt like anything was achievable and the European Cup was an obsession for the man staring out from the home dugout.It feels very different now. This defeat was another demonstration of how far England’s biggest club have dropped away in the post-Ferguson years and, ultimately, the side now managed by José Mourinho came up so short it must have been a chastening experience for the supporters who remember better times.It was a night that provided compelling evidence that, for the modern United, it is a long way back. They survived a mauling from Cristiano Ronaldo – even if he did set up the goal – but the story of this match was of one team who are very much a work in progress and another set of players who give the impression they are completely in tune with one another.Juventus spread their feathers, peacock-style, in the first half. They assumed control with a goal from Paulo Dybala, the game’s outstanding performer, and got away with some carelessness in the second half because, frankly, United’s front men are good players – sometimes excellent – but not the kind of elite footballers who will unduly trouble Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci et al on the big nights.Romelu Lukaku, Marcus Rashford and a few others found out the hard way and, in the process, United discovered why Juventus had begun the season with 10 successive victories. Massimiliano Allegri’s side arrived with a four-point lead at the top of Serie A, on course presumably to win their eighth Italian title in a row, and the seen-it-all-before expression that you might expect from a club that regards their record in the European Cup, as two-times winners yet seven-times beaten finalists, an affront. Juve looked, in short, a cut above. And then, of course, they had a player wearing the No 7 shirt like a fashion statement, with a blur of orange in his boots and the look on his face, as always, that he fancied himself as the nearest thing in football to The Fonz.On the previous occasion Ronaldo came back to Old Trafford it was with Real Madrid in 2013 and Sir Alex Ferguson, always scheming, had the idea for the public announcer to change the order in which the players’ names were read out. Ronaldo was ushered in last as “the magnificent No 7” because Ferguson wanted to crank up the pressure on his former player just before kick-off.For a while, it looked like a brilliant ploy and Ronaldo did struggle uncharacteristically with the weight of expectation. Until, that is, he scored the goal that dumped United out of the competition and signalled Ferguson’s final involvement in the Champions League.This time, there were no special measures other than Ashley Young clipping his heels on the first occasion Ronaldo shaped to get away from his marker with the kind of drag-back that has nostalgic qualities inside this stadium. Ronaldo picked himself off the grass with a knowing smile and quickly set about making his presence felt again. He might have heard a few boos at times but it was a standing ovation to accompany him to the tunnel after the final whistle. Ronaldo even took a selfie for one of the two pitch invaders, both of whom were desperate to get a souvenir snap of their hero, and that delay ensured he was the last man off the pitch – just the way he likes it, with all the attention on him.Rumour has it he has a rather sizeable ego, so he might actually be a touch frustrated he could not sprinkle more of his magic dust over the game. He did, however, make a telling contribution with the cross that led to the 17th-minute goal. Ronaldo might have started on the left but he was operating, as ever, with a licence to roam and on this occasion it took him to the right wing. His cross was aimed for Juan Cuadrado at the near post but flicked off the nearest United player, Chris Smalling, and fell invitingly for Dybala, with the pace now taken off the ball. From six yards, it was a simple finish for a player of Dybala’s talents.The rest of the first half must have been startling for the home crowd given Juve will always be one of the clubs United measure themselves against. David de Gea’s goalkeeping kept the score down but the imbalance of talent spread unease. Passes went astray. Nemanja Matic aimed for Rashford on one occasion and put the ball straight out for a throw-in. At other times it was Paul Pogba waving an apologetic hand. Pogba, a former Juve player, cannot have enjoyed the superiority of his former club.At least United improved after the break and, with a bit more luck, the ricochet could conceivably have gone for them when Pogba’s low shot bounced off the post, struck the goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny on the head and zigzagged out for a corner.It would be stretching the truth, however, to say the home side were unfortunate overall and, again, there was the sight of Mourinho holding up three fingers as his default response to baiting from opposition supporters.At Chelsea on Saturday it was to signify the three Premier League titles he had won for the club three days on, it was to remind the Italian fans that his achievements for Internazionale included the treble. That, however, was 2010 and on nights like these it feels a long time ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e21ad4d270bc48459c21cb7461ea433f08d65b18/6_107_4204_2522/master/4204.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dabf1f5745d79de8eade1f7e3e7723f","title":"real madrid viktoria plzen champions league match report","story":"Julen Lopetegui will still be Real Madrid’s manager when they face Barcelona in el clásico on Sunday night, despite him walking off to the sound of whistles.Although Real won for the first time in five games and much as Lopetegui expressed hope that it was a turning point, a 2-1 victory over Viktoria Plzen did not convince supporters at the Santiago Bernabéu and will not have been enough to win over the club’s president, Florentino Pérez, who is inclined to wield the axe. The club’s director of institutional relations, though, insisted Lopetegui will remain in charge – at least until the weekend.Informed of that vote of confidence and asked what it meant to him a few minutes later, Lopetegui said: “That’s far from important what’s important was winning the game today. The team had a great need for this triumph – their coach did too of course. We want to get out of these circumstances. You can’t change everything overnight but we hope this is a turning point.”“We haven’t always won when we deserved to but football is like that,” Lopetegui added. “We came from a run of quite a lot of games without winning and the objective was to win in circumstances that were not at all simple. It’s true that when there is a moment of weakness because you won’t win, any team is more susceptible which is why it was so important to gain victory. We need to gain a little tranquillity bit by bit: we have to keep going. On Sunday we have a game that motivates us a huge amount.”Marcelo’s goal against Levante at the weekend had been Real’s first for eight hours and one minute – just 13 minutes short of their worst drought – and was insufficient to prevent them being beaten for a fourth time in five games. Although they got two more here, Lopetegui knows the club are seeking his replacement and that only the same lack of alternatives and time that helped put him in the job in the first place are keeping him in a job now.This game was never likely to be decisive the way it played out was certainly unlikely to convince anyone that Real’s ills are over. The Czech side had previously been beaten 5-0 by Roma and while the hosts took a 2-0 lead with goals from Karim Benzema and Marcelo, a goal from Patrik Hrosovsky with 12 minutes remaining demonstrated Real’s vulnerability.Plzen had previously made, and failed to take, three excellent opportunities, and threatened to score an equaliser during the final, nervous minutes here. The fans had feared another failure and at the end there was relief but also anger. Plzen’s players applauded their fans while Real’s departed swiftly. Lopetegui had gone before them, whistles ringing round. He will have another opportunity – or rather an obligation – on Sunday, but beyond that it’s a different story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80165488d4c3253f1a5438d95da4bc774af1942b/0_88_3438_2063/master/3438.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f968ef89106c50c75433d5adf6a94cf","title":"shakhtar donetsk manchester city champions league match report","story":"Kharkiv is an unlikely holiday destination but, as midnight approached and the final whistle blew, Pep Guardiola bore the serene look of a man who had just spent a week unwinding at a tropical resort.David Silva’s scoring volley and creation of a second goal for Aymeric Laporte not only greatly enhanced Manchester City’s chances of escaping a tight group and progressing to the knockout stages but de-stressed their noticeably edgy coach. By the time Bernardo Silva made it three courtesy of his first touch – namely a 20 yard shot which went in off a post – Guardiola’s technical area prowling was no longer reminiscent of a cat on a hot tin roof. City had moved to the top of Group F and the returning Kevin De Bruyne had reminded everyone of his rare class.“It’s in our hands,” said Guardiola who, not surprisingly, struggled to stop smiling. “The first half was the best we’ve played in the past few seasons, we were outstanding. We were under pressure after losing the first game to Lyon but now we can control our destiny. It was so important to get this win here. To score three goals against Shakhtar here is amazing, an incredible result.”After becoming Europe’s highest paid manager and spending £500m since taking charge of the world’s wealthiest club in 2016 Guardiola is expected to choreograph Champions League glory – and, preferably, sooner rather than later.Perhaps he has been feeling the pressure as, on the eve of the game, Guardiola suggested City were still missing something “special” before berating fans for declining to fully buy into the European dream.It seemed rather harsh on those 825 travelling supporters who had made the 1,650 mile journey to eastern Ukraine with some taking three separate flights to a fixture which kicked off at 10pm local time.That travelling band were appeased by De Bruyne’s welcome restoration to the starting XI after injuring his knee and looking anything but ring rusty. Indeed the Belgian’s adhesive touch and elusive movement represented a principal reason why City dominated so easily with John Stones rarely tested in his ersatz right back role.The war in Donbass between Ukrainian armed forces and Russian-backed separatists dictates that Paulo Fonseca’s Shakhtar are exiled to Kharkiv on match days. As the night time temperature plumetted, they received impressive highly charge support but it could not compensate for the absence of two key creators in Taison and Marlos.Without his fellow south American’s promptings, the Brazilian striker Junior Moraes offered few hints of the form which has seen him score in virtually every appearance this season.Yet as the chill began biting, Shakhtar warmed up sufficiently to sporadically irritate their guests by interrupting City’s fluency and Ismaily’s overlapping incursions from left-back started troubling Stones a little.Ditto Fernando’s powers of left wing acceleration and quite startling change of pace. Yet such cameos remained relatively isolated if a clever back-heel which might have created a goal reminded everyone of Moraes’s talent, Riyad Mahrez shot narrowly wide as City counterattacked.As Guardiola’s players barraged his goal Andriy Pyatov moved sharply off his line to block Gabriel Jesus’s path following David Silva’s reverse pass. Silva was settling into a familiarly glorious groove and, after connecting with Mahrez’s cross, volleyed against an upright.City’s captain for the night then went one better, lashing a supremely assured left-foot volley beyond Pyatov after Jesus’s shot was deflected into his path. Instructively, Silva’s goal prefaced a slightly manic technical area celebration on Guardiola’s part there was a definite sense of tension evaporating. “David does everything perfect. Another incredible performance from him.”With the former Shakhtar cult hero, Fernandinho’s control of central midfield ensuring that City dominated possession their manager’s underlying fears of unscheduled group stage elimination were further banished by Laporte. When Benjamin Mendy’s shot was palmed away from a corner all that remained was for Silva to execute the set piece and the unmarked centre-half headed past Pyatov.Shakhtar were clearly second best but, even though Ismaily blocked a goal-bound Silva shot, they still had their moments. How the Metalist cursed as Mykola Matviyenko headed fractionally wide and the underemployed Ederson reacted smartly to parry Ismaily’s shot.Such scares seemed irrelevant as Bernardo Silva replaced the tiring De Bruyne and instantly benefited from Jesus’s decoy run to shoot the third. A few days in Ukraine had left Guardiola with the contented glow of a man checking out of a health spa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea45abec1afcf508016af5bbd3f2cc7ff31112f/0_415_5316_3188/master/5316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f3a9c4bfe4ebd49d8844ded3bada2f","title":"ecuador says assange must sort out own issues with britain","story":"Foreign minister says officials will no longer intervene with UK authorities on fugitive’s behalfEcuador does not plan to intervene with the British government on behalf of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in talks over his situation in the South American country’s London embassy, Ecuador’s foreign minister said on Tuesday.Foreign minister José Valencia said in an interview with Reuters that Ecuador’s only responsibility was looking after Assange’s wellbeing, after the Australian national sued the country over new conditions placed on his asylum in the London embassy.“Ecuador has no responsibility to take any further steps,” Valencia said. “We are not Mr Assange’s lawyers, nor are we representatives of the British government. This is a matter to be resolved between Assange and Great Britain.”This position marks a departure from Ecuador’s previous practice of maintaining dialogue with British authorities over Assange’s situation since granting him asylum in 2012, when he took refuge in Ecuador’s London embassy after British courts ordered his extradition to Sweden to face questioning in a sexual molestation case.That case has since been dropped but friends and supporters have said that Assange now fears he could be arrested and eventually extradited to the United States if he leaves the embassy.The Foreign Office did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Greg Barns, an Australian lawyer advising Assange, said in an email that “developments in the case in recent times” showed the need for Australia’s government to intervene to assist “one of its citizens who faces real danger”.WikiLeaks, which published US diplomatic and military secrets when Assange ran the operation, faces a US grand jury investigation.Valencia said he was “frustrated” by Assange’s decision to file suit in an Ecuadorean court last week over new terms of his asylum, which required him to pay for medical bills and telephone calls and to clean up after his pet cat.“There is no obligation in international agreements for Ecuador to pay for things like Mr Assange’s laundry,” he said.Ecuadorean president Lenin Moreno has said that asylum is not meant to be eternal, but he has expressed concern about the possibility that Assange may be extradited to the United States. Valencia said on Tuesday that he has not discussed Assange’s situation with the United States’ government.In December 2017, Ecuador granted Assange Ecuadorean citizenship and sought to name him as a member of the country’s diplomatic mission in Britain and Russia, which could have assured him safe passage to leave the embassy. Britain denied the request.

England were a sorry 132 for nine from 26.1 overs, having earlier shipped 366 for six on a bounteous pitch, and thus under the stand-in leadership of Jos Buttler had suffered their heaviest defeat by way of runs: 219 the margin on DLS.Morgan’s step aside had granted Sam Curran a second cap but in doing so reduced the number of outright specialist batsmen by one. The captain was unrepentant but what he could not abide was the overall team performance.“We didn’t take our game forward,” Morgan said. “Actually, there are areas where it went backwards. Our fielding was extremely poor, our attitude very poor and that has to be addressed. We will find an answer, otherwise we are just papering over the cracks.”Needing their highest successful run chase, it was pretty much game over for England only 10 balls in as Jason Roy, Alex Hales and Jos Buttler all departed amid a surge from Sri Lanka’s opening bowlers that left the tourists four for three.Roy was bowled by a sparkling yorker from Kasun Rajitha for four, before Hales and Buttler both nicked off to Dushmantha Chameera for ducks. When Joe Root slapped the same bowler to point in the eighth over, it was 28 for four and only two batsmen of established ODI pedigree remained.Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali did briefly offer defiance, with the former battling cramp to crack 67 and the latter feeling bat on ball for the first time this tour with 37. But the need to go hard played into the hands of Sri Lanka and Akila Dananjaya, their mystery spinner, returned figures of four for 19 as the extended lower order buckled.Morgan’s chief frustration stemmed from Sri Lanka’s innings, however, as they topped their ODI best against England (324 for two at Headingley in 2006) after each of the top four bludgeoned half-centuries.With Mark Wood and Liam Plunkett given a chance to play, Sam and Tom Curran installed as England’s first brothers since Adam and Ben Hollioake in 1999, as well as regulars Stokes, Moeen and Adil Rashid, Buttler had seven bowlers at his disposal.But bar Rashid, whose one for 52 from 10 overs felt a triumph in the circumstances, the punishment that followed was heavy for all, with 32 fours and 11 sixes struck by Sri Lanka on a heartbreaker of a flat pitch. Morgan popped on as sub at times but this could not inspire his charges. Three catches went down – Wood and Tom Curran handed Dinesh Chandimal early lives en route to a bristling 80 from 73 balls – and in the sapping humidity, sloppy errors saw close relationships become frayed, summed up by Stokes hurling a ball into the turf in anger.Niroshan Dickwella and Sadeera Samarawickrama flew out of the traps for an opening stand of 137 from 19.1 overs. So head-spinning was their flurry of carves, whips, scoops and pulls that when finally separated – the latter bowled by Moeen Ali for 54 – it took an umpire review to confirm ball had brushed stump, with bowler and wicketkeeper oblivious.When a seemingly drained Dickwella edged Moeen to short third man on 95 in the 26th over, this previously callow Sri Lanka side could easily have lost their way. But Chandimal and Kusal Mendis stepped on the gas again, sharing a stand of 102 from 77 balls. Mendis was in a particularly incendiary mood, blazing 56 from just 33, including six sixes, off the back of three ducks and a five from his last four ODIs. Though finally picking out deep midwicket to give Plunkett some cheer on an otherwise chastening return, at 285 for three with 10 overs to go, Sri Lanka were on for 400.Rashid’s removal of Dasun Shanaka in the deep and two wickets in two balls from Tom Curran – Chandimal and Perera holing out to slower balls – stemmed the bleeding somewhat but with a final catch going down from Moeen, the next and final ball smashed for six by Dhanajaya de Silva, the hosts were buzzing and did not look back thereafter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60811cd8d4cd906b5f4967ad5e8b4c7e21d1fee2/0_119_2921_1753/master/2921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbd8b7623a72485be8ce0b1b84faa7b6","title":"storm clouds rugby union calender lions","story":"The game’s calendar is expanding with the next Lions tour to South Africa stretching into AugustTheresa May would have felt right at home at Twickenham on Tuesday. Even a workable Brexit deal sometimes feels more achievable than locating the solution to rugby union’s unfeasibly tight fixture calendar. For a quarter of a century, if not longer, the sport has been trying to squeeze a globally-accepted quart into a disputed pint pot and the eureka moment has yet to materialise.We still live in an age where the faintest of tweaks, largely irrelevant in the wider scheme of things, are hailed as triumphant advances. No English player, for example, will be permitted in future to be involved in more than 35 matches per year or start more than 30 games a season, down from 32. Hold those exultant trumpets: in the southern hemisphere and Ireland many top players already play a third fewer games. The off-season? Blink and you’ll miss it from a fan’s perspective. Summer is about to become the new winter, with the British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa in 2021 concluding on the first weekend in August. The following domestic season is due to start on 12 September. Admittedly, the English players on the Lions tour will have a mandatory 10 weeks off but, even so, a dubious new first awaits. For the first time competitive pro games involving English players or teams will take place in every single month of the calendar year.There will now be only two Augusts in the next five summers – 2020 and 2022 – when there will be no meaningful rugby played. The official disclaimer is that no inidual will be playing rugby for 11 months of the year just as well because Nigel Melville, the Rugby Football Union’s rugby director, Mark McCafferty, of Premiership Rugby, and Damian Hopley, of the Rugby Players’ Association, would all be forced to resign en bloc if so. The inescapable truth is that the calendar is expanding at precisely the moment all sides accept that playing the sport has never been more physically demanding. Stick that slogan on the side of a bus.No one yet knows how ruinous the recurring failure to embrace a less is more approach will ultimately prove. There are already some unhealthy side-effects. Take the Lions, the most universally loved and commercially vibrant team in the game. Their next tour is already being compromised like never before: it will last five weeks and incorporate eight games.McCafferty has also revealed the 2021 Premiership final will be played on 26 June, leaving any chosen Lions from England’s two leading clubs with an almost impossibly slim window in which to switch mentally into Lions mode and challenge for first Test selection. Who could blame a Lions coach, with the Pro14 having finished weeks earlier, for concluding that selecting Irish, Welsh and Scottish players makes more sense? Or some English players for starting to wonder whether, from a professional satisfaction viewpoint, it is worth them touring at all?There was also depressingly little support for Agustín Pichot’s brave new world of more meaningful autumn Tests. As far as club and union officials in England are concerned, World Rugby’s vice-chairman might as well be speaking to them in Serbo-Croat. With summer tours by northern hemisphere tier one nations in the two years following a World Cup set to be restricted to two Tests, as agreed in San Francisco last year, there is growing doubt as to whether any over-arching league format is possible. That will not, naturally, prevent the RFU from continuing to look to schedule a fourth November international at Twickenham outside the official window.For the moment, insists Hopley, the players – aka the meat in the sandwich – have mostly been placated and strike action is not on the horizon. Given the increasing uncertainty surrounding the professional game’s finances, at home and abroad, many have clearly concluded they have little choice but to suck it up, trusting those in authority to crack down hard on clubs who fail to grant their players the enforced rest – a five-week summer break plus the odd fallow week during the season – to which they are now entitled. If there is a silver lining to the new-age schedule it is that enlightened player management and mental wellbeing support will have to be taken ever more seriously.In the meantime, take a step back and ask yourself three questions. Does an 11-month season feel like progress? Does summer rugby union in England – rubbing shoulders in June with football World Cups, Test cricket, Royal Ascot, Wimbledon and rugby league – float your pedalo? And will this week’s announcement be hailed in 10 years’ time as the moment professional rugby union saw the light? Only incurable optimists and gluttons for punishment will be answering yes to all three."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee7d3e797b7d5a4554b123ba3557c6aea08a653b/0_223_4420_2653/master/4420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6869fca762c806bdb7fa29df8a8b549d","title":"world series boston red sox los angeles dodgers game 1","story":"Fenway Park proved too tricky, too cold and just too much for the Dodgers in the World Series opener. Andrew Benintendi, JD Martinez and the Boston Red Sox came out swinging, seizing every advantage in their quirky ballpark to beat Los Angeles 8-4 on a chilly, windy Tuesday night.Benintendi delivered four hits, Martinez drove in two early runs and pinch-hitter Eduardo Nunez golfed a three-run homer to seal it. “Up and down the lineup there’s not an easy out. We’re going to grind out at-bats,” Benintendi said after the game.\u0026nbspThe 108-win Red Sox got a strong effort from their bullpen after an expected duel between aces Chris Sale and Clayton Kershaw failed to ignite.From the very start, Fenway Park caused all sorts of problems for the Dodgers. Mookie Betts led off for the Red Sox with a popup that twisted first baseman David Freese as he tried to navigate the tight foul space near the stands: he overran the ball and it dropped behind him. Given a second chance, Betts lined a single that set up a two-run first inning.In the seventh, left fielder Joc Pederson looked hesitant as he chased Benintendi’s soft fly, rushing toward the seats that jut out down the line. The ball ticked off his glove for a double, and soon Nunez connected to break open a 5-4 game.The crowd and cold temperatures were no picnic for the Dodgers, either, and Fenway Park became an echo chamber even before the first pitch. Chants of “Beat LA!” began early, Kershaw got heckled with a sing-song serenade and Red Sox villain Manny Machado heard loud boos all evening.Only one person wearing Dodger blue drew a cheer: manager Dave Roberts, saluted in pregame introductions for the daring steal that turned the tide in Boston’s 2004 playoff comeback against the Yankees.It was 53F (11.5C) for the first pitch, the coldest game for Los Angeles this year and quite a contrast from last year’s World Series, when it was a record 103F (39C) for the opener at Dodger Stadium.The Red Sox are playing in their fourth World Series in 15 years, having won in 2004, 2007 and 2013. The Dodgers are playing in their second straight Fall Classic, though they haven’t won the title since 1988. Game 2 is on Wednesday night, when it’s supposed to be even colder.

Wozniacki, who started her White Group campaign with a loss to Karolina Pliskova on Sunday, spent most of the match pinned on the baseline but her consistency and patience proved vital as she pulled away in the final set. “I played much better today. I served and returned pretty well, and moved really well against a player who is so powerful that you have to stay on your game,” Wozniacki said. “You never know what is going to happen against Petra, so I just stayed focused and got a lot of balls back.” The match was a cagey affair from the outset with seven holds of serve in a row. But after they traded breaks as the intensity levels picked up, Wozniacki broke again to seal the opener when Kvitova blasted a forehand into the net. Kvitova took control of the second set with an early break, then lost momentum when Wozniacki took a timeout for treatment on her knee, before she regained the upper hand to level the match with a sliced backhand winner on her third set point. Sensing her title defence was in tatters, Wozniacki regrouped to break at the start of the decider when she put away a backhand to win the longest rally of the match, and ran away with the contest as Kvitova wilted in the final set. Wozniacki sealed victory on her first match point with a big serve that Kvitova sent long, and will hope to win her final match of round robin play against Elina Svitolina to secure a semi-final berth. “I just always believe in myself, that I am going to win when I go out on court. I was just out there, had the belief and fought to the end,” Wozniacki added.Svitolina, meanwhile, moved one step closer to reaching the semi-finals by defeating Pliskova 6-3, 2-6, 6-3. The world No 7 Svitolina followed up Sunday’s straight sets victory over Kvitova, to make it back-to-back wins in her White Group matches. Svitolina out-served her seventh-seeded opponent, firing eight aces to triumph in an hour and 54 minutes. AgenciesCaroline Wozniacki speaks! “I’m just pleased how I kept cool out there. I didn’t think I played badly in the second set and I just had to stay focused. The level today was way better than it was on Sunday from both of us. Hopefully I get a good match on Thursday. My knee is all right. I’m going to get some treatment and thankfully I get some rest before Thursday.” That’s all from me. Thanks for reading. Bye.Caroline Wozniacki was struggling with a left knee injury at the end of the second set but she ploughed on and has given herself a great chance of reaching the semi-finals. She plays Elina Svitolina on Thursday. As for Petra Kvitova, who plays Karolina Pliskova next, her hopes are hanging by a thread. Svitolina and Pliskova meet next.Serving for the match, Wozniacki makes it 15-0 when she pings a backhand past Kvitova. The game goes to 15-all.

Another break!Second set: Wozniacki 7-5, 1-1 Kvitova* (*denotes server): Kvitova nets a forehand to hand Wozniacki three break points. She receives a time violation before serving.

Kvitova’s game is scratchy, though, and it’s soon 30-all. Another error hands Wozniacki a set point. Kvitova saves it with a huge forehand down the line for deuce.

This time she’s more patient, working Kvitova over before taking control with a fierce backhand. Wozniacki’s able to move on to a short ball and ram a forehand away to break! She’ll serve for the set.First set: Wozniacki* 4-3 Kvitova (*denotes sever): Another uneventful hold. Wozniacki asks to see her coach, presumably just so they can discuss how well she’s serving.First set: Wozniacki 3-3 Kvitova* (*denotes sever): At 30-0, Kvitova surprises Wozniacki with a lovely drop shot. From there, she holds without ceremony.First set: Wozniacki* 3-2 Kvitova (*denotes sever): Wozniacki skips merrily into a 40-0 lead. Kvitova hits back with a rasping backhand winner. But it makes no difference. Kvitova has asked to see her coach.First set: Wozniacki 2-2 Kvitova* (*denotes sever): The game goes to 30-all, at which point Wozniacki enters wall mode, forcing Kvitova to send a forehand long. The Dane can’t convert, though, netting a forehand. Deuce. Wozniacki slumps and Kvitova holds.First set: Wozniacki* 2-1 Kvitova (*denotes sever): Wozniacki breezes into a 40-15 lead. She holds to 30. We are in the sparring stages.First set: Wozniacki 1-1 Kvitova* (*denotes sever): Kvitova shows some smart skills at the net to make it 30-0. Then she steers a backhand away to make it 40-15. An easy hold to 30.First set: Wozniacki* 1-0 Kvitova (*denotes sever): The match opens with Caroline Wozniacki on serve. Kvitova’s quickly on the offensive, hitting through the ball with venomous power and earning a couple of break points with some fizzing groundstrokes. She lets Wozniacki off the hook with a couple of errors, though. The game goes to deuce and Wozniacki holds.These two have met 13 times. Petra Kvitova leads the head-to-head 8-5. She’s also won their last four matches.Hello. “Life makes me happy,” Petra Kvitova said after her comprehensive defeat to Elina Svitolina in her opening match at the WTA Finals. It was a positive message from the two-time Wimbledon champion and maintaining that kind of mentality should help her in her quest to bounce back against Caroline Wozniacki today. Delivered from another athlete, that quote might have sounded like loser talk. But given that Kvitova is fortunate merely to be alive after suffering terrible injuries to her left hand during a knife attack in her home in December 2016, it isn’t hard to understand her reactions after losing a tennis match. From the Czech’s perspective, simply making it to the season’s finale is a victory on its own.Given that she’s in Singapore, though, Kvitova might as well do all she can to make her stay last as long as possible. But this is a tricky assignment. Wozniacki, who also needs to kickstart her tournament after losing her opener to Karolina Pliskova, has also demonstrated resolve during her career. The Dane was once mocked for being a world No1 without a grand slam. Yet Wozniacki had the last laugh when she beat Simona Halep in this year’s Australian Open final and she can also draw on the experience of winning this tournament last year. She might have the edge, especially on a court that’s been playing quite slowly.Play begins at 12.30pm BST."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf11cf67c2a4c6f22a61e09e1fc1118b45179a87/1233_138_2375_1425/master/2375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81f4dca2d0246519f4383c1b3aa5dca5","title":"iphone xr review roundup cheaper brighter battery longer iphone xs","story":"Early consensus from tech press is £749 iPhone XR is in many ways better than the £999 iPhone XSThe first wave of verdicts from select reviewers given early access to Apple’s latest iPhone XR are here, and if their thoughts are any indication of what to expect, cheaper means better.The £999 iPhone XS and £1,099 XS Max were and brilliant in many ways, but were a little on the expensive side. But the iPhone XR costs £749, has the same processor, same Face ID and same look as the £250 more expensive models, with a 6.1in LCD screen instead of a 5.8in or 6.5in OLED screen., not given early access to the new phones, will review them at a later date. For now, this is what a privileged few thought of the cheaper, but not exactly cheap, 2018 iPhone.I haven’t been this excited about an iPhone model in years. The iPhone XR is built to be the best everyday phone engine in Apple’s iPhone lineup, based on things I value: price, battery, speed and key features like the camera. The iPhone XR is the sensible car with the good gas mileage, but with a supercharged engine under the hood and an understated spoiler on the trunk – and I love that. It’s what more Apple products should shoot for. It’s a good size and, very nearly, a perfect phone for its price.The iPhone XR is not the most technologically advanced iPhone many of Apple’s superior components have been reserved for the costlier device. But the iPhone XR is still a moderately great phone. It’s great not in the way that super-futuristic, game-changing technology devices are. It’s great in the way that a bunch of already-possible things have been packaged together cleanly and nicely.The XR is a little wider, thicker and taller than the XS, but it never feels unwieldy. In fact, since it in sits in a nice little sweet spot between the XS and the massive Max, the XR arguably offers the best blend of size and usability. Build quality is up to Apple’s usual standards, which is to say it’s impeccable. The iPhone XR may cost less than the phones I reviewed a month ago, but it doesn’t feel like it. In fact, I’ve come to prefer the XR’s design over the othersThe long-held iPhone-nomics theory is that when you spend more, you get proportionately more, but the XR defies that.Sure, there are some XR trade-offs, including a lower-contrast, lower-resolution LCD screen and a single camera on the back. But I barely noticed the differences in everyday use. Actually, after using the XR, I believe the XS has a bigger trade-off – namely, shorter battery life. When weighing the two options, decide what features you care about most. And keep in mind that, for most people, the “XS” stands for X … S … ive.This is likely to be one of the main reasons why the iPhone XR is less expensive: OLED technology is pricey but makes for richer, super-sharp and detailed displays. The iPhone XR’s display is still bright, but its 828 x 1792 pixel resolution lacks the pin-sharpness afforded by OLED technology. For many people, this won’t make a great amount of difference on a day-to-day basis, but it’s noticeably duller if you’ve become accustomed to OLED.The first thing you’ll notice on most iPhone XRs is the colour. The XR is the first phone Apple’s produced in a playful colour palate in a while. Besides the traditional white and black, there’s also a lovely red, coral, yellow and blue. The colours are eye-catching, though the aluminium sides don’t match the vibrant glass backs. Consequently, the phone can look a little cheap, especially next to the stainless steel sides on the XS.The XR lacks 3D Touch, the iPhone feature that lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. Instead, placing your finger over a button, like the camera shortcut on the lock screen, and holding it down results in haptic feedback. This is a negligible omission: I forgot that 3D Touch even existed because I rarely use it.I rarely take zoom photos, so I didn’t miss the telephoto lens from the iPhone XS at all — especially since the iPhone XR can still take portrait photos with its single lens. In fact, I preferred the XR’s portrait mode to the XS, because the XR’s brighter f1.8 lens and larger image sensor is much better in low light than the telephoto camera the XS uses for portrait shots. The quality of XS portrait mode shots tends to drop fairly quickly in low light, but the XR is actually pretty respectable. And the XR also takes wider angle portrait shots than the iPhone XS or the Pixel 3, which I find tremendously useful.The XR has a version of Portrait Mode, too, but Apple accomplishes the bokeh effect not with a separate camera, but through software and machine learning. The result isn’t quite as precise. On iPhones with dual rear cameras, you get a closer image with a more accurate sense of depth.What’s more, the Portrait Mode on the XR works only when you’re shooting people. And while, granted, this is typically how you take advantage of the feature, I sometimes also use Portrait mode on other phones to shoot flowers or other close-up objects.We won’t beat around the bush here. The iPhone XR completely backs up one of Apple’s big claims: that it offers the best battery life of any phone from the Cupertino brand.Finally, we’re looking at an iPhone that can last for the whole day without giving battery anxiety. Of course, your mileage will vary with any phone, but we’re really impressed to see all the little tricks offered by the iPhone XS’ battery management (such as being able to be very power efficient when working as a car navigation system on GPS) but also just being able to go into a nice power-saving mode.The iPhone XS and XS Max might be the best iPhones on paper for 2018, the consensus appears to be that a saving of £250 of the iPhone XR is worth the trade-off with slightly less boundary-pushing technology.Although it’s worth noting that if you’re open to other manufacturers, £749 is around the same price as the top-spec Samsung, Google or OnePlus device of similar size, meaning while the iPhone XR may cost less than the iPhone XS, it’s definitely not cheap."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7188eda2bedecd74539e8987286a604ac430294c/0_0_4063_2438/master/4063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04c8ac5eea9acccf60385e96eae50439","title":"google pixel 3 xl review big device performance camera screen","story":"This device picks up where last year’s version left off, with smooth performance, excellent camera and fantastic screenGoogle’s iPhone XS Max competitor brings a big screen, a big notch and a big glass body, but is the Pixel 3 XL good enough to beat the phablet kings?The smaller of Google’s new Pixel smartphones is arguably the best small Android phone going, and the Pixel 3 XL shares many of its best traits.The backs of the devices are a spitting image of each other – two-tone glass, part polished, part etched. The glossy coated metal sides and glass back have a luxurious, smooth feel in the hand.The etched surface hides the mess of fingerprints usually associated with glass-backed phones, but is slightly more slippery than the polished section. After a couple of weeks it became a little less slippery, but at 76.7mm wide the Pixel 3 XL is not a small phone.Handling it one-handed is a challenge, but its lighter 184g weight helps compared with the 208g iPhone XS Max and 201g Samsung Galaxy Note 9.The 6.3in screen is beautiful. Crisp, colourful and improved over last year. It’s not quite as eye-popping as Samsung or Apple’s best, but it is very close, and the difference is now down to a matter of taste.There is, however, a massive notch containing the dual selfie camera and speaker. Aesthetic debates aside, it’s important to note that because the notch is so tall it takes up a big chunk of the screen at the top, with the area either side exclusively being used for the status bar.As such, despite being 0.3in bigger on the diagonal than the Pixel 2 XL, the Pixel 3 XL has essentially only gained a status-bar’s height on the screen compared with last year’s phone. The usable screen area therefore works out about 0.3mm taller than the Pixel 2 XL, as Android ignores the space either side of the notch in most full-screen apps such as Netflix, Amazon or most other video apps. YouTube and Google Photos are the most obvious exceptions.There isn’t enough room either side of the notch for most of the status bar icons either. If you have the battery percentage visible, the phone connected to wifi and set to vibrate, if you connect a set of Bluetooth headphones you end up with a dot in the right side of the status bar indicating there are more icons needed than can fit.The same goes for notification icons on the left, which have to fit in the small area between the time and the notch. Google is not alone in having this problem, but it is very pronounced on the Pixel 3 XL.The Pixel 3 has Qualcomm’s current top-of-the-line processor the Snapdragon 845, as used in the OnePlus 6 and most other current flagship smartphones, with the exception of the UK versions of Samsung’s S9 and Note 9 and Huawei’s phones, both of which use their own-brand chips.The Pixel 3 only has 4GB of RAM, compared with 6GB or even 8GB in some top-end Android competitors. While it might lose in a game of Top Trumps, it’s not noticeable in daily use because the Pixel 3 is simply buttery-smooth in operation, with top-notch gaming performance too.I noticed some aggressive background app handling. If you shoot 14 photos in rapid concession while listening to Spotify, the Pixel 3 XL will terminate Spotify in the background, stopping the music. I only encountered this behaviour when actively looking for it, however.Battery life was similar to the smaller Pixel 3, managing just over 24 hours between charges. Used as my primary device, sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music with Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, watching 30 minutes of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day, the Pixel 3 XL made it from my 7am alarm to about 7.30am the next morning.Lighter usage saw another couple of hours of battery life. Charging is fast via the included USB-C cable, and via the Pixel Stand wireless charger, but limited to only 5W via current third-party wireless chargers.The Pixel 3 XL runs the latest version of Android 9 Pie with Google’s new mandatory gesture controls replacing the traditional back, home and overview navigation buttons, and Gmail’s new Smart Compose on mobile, which makes writing dull emails less laborious.Google hasn’t made any alterations specifically for the larger 6.3in screen on the Pixel 3 XL, but Gboard supports one-handed typing mode and the gesture button is easy to reach with your thumb.There are digital wellbeing tools, including time trackers and Google’s Wind Down, which activates do not disturb and sets the screen to monochrome to dissuade you from using it.Overall this is the smoothest, most refined version of Android available on any smartphone, rivalling Apple’s iOS on the iPhone XS for slickness.The Pixel 3 XL has the exact same camera as fitted to its smaller sibling, and as such as genuinely brilliant, capturing richly detailed and vibrant images in practically any lighting condition with little to no photographic skill required.New for the Pixel 3 is Google’s Super Res Zoom, which is an enhanced digital zoom that works very well, but can’t quite beat rivals with telescopic cameras at maximum magnification. The on-device AI-powered Top Shot advisor captures multiple frames before and after you hit the shutter button and flags when it thinks it’s got a better image than you managed manually.The portrait mode is also great, despite the lack of another camera on the back. On the front there’s a dual selfie camera system, one standard and one ultra wide-angle camera, which means you can squeeze more people into a shot.For more detail on the camera performance, please see the Pixel 3 review.The Pixel Stand is an optional £69 wireless-charging stand that has two unique features for the Pixel 3 and 3 XL. The first is the ability to wirelessly charge the new Google smartphones at 10W. Third-party Qi wireless chargers can currently only charge the Pixel 3 and 3 XL at 5W, although certified Made for Google wireless chargers will be available at the later date that can charge the phones at the full 10W.The second is it turns the smartphone into a portrait Google Assistant smart display, a little like the Google Home Hub. When you put the phone on the stand with the screen off it launches Google Assistant mode, which either lights an ambient display with time, date and notifications like normal, with an added Google Assistant box at the bottom, or displays a selection of your Google Photos.It also activates the smart-speaker-like always-listening mode that waits for the wake words “Hey Google”, firing up Google Assistant barking out answers using the speakers and displaying results on the screen.It can also act as a sunrise alarm, lighting up the screen 15 minutes before your morning alarm goes off in warm red to yellow tones, and lights up with a live feed from the front door if someone rings the Nest Hello doorbell you might have.It works well enough, but is expensive for a wireless charger and I suspect few will deem it an essential purchase.The Google Pixel 3 is available for £869 with 64GB of storage or £969 with 128GB of storage, in a choice of black, white or pink.The Pixel 3 XL is a great smartphone, but unlike last year’s XL offering, it isn’t necessarily the best Google phone – the smaller, cheaper Pixel 3 is in many ways a better phone.The Pixel 3 XL is a slick, attractive and lovely-feeling device, but it’s also pretty big and relatively slippery, making it more difficult to handle than last year’s Pixel 2 XL. Its lighter weight is an advantage against rivals in reducing the potential hand pain caused by its size though.It’s got a cracking camera, and a beautiful screen, but the notch might put some off. I didn’t generally notice its presence except when it blocked status bar icons, which I found annoying.While £869 is definitely not cheap, it does undercut the top-end, big-screen rivals such as the Note 9 and iPhone XS Max by a little or a lot. So if you want a big screen and a super-refined Android experience, the Pixel 3 XL is the one to buy.Pros: super smooth and fluid performance, great screen, squeezable sides, Android 9 Pie and 3 years of updates, water resistant, fantastic camera, wireless chargingCons: massive notch, no expandable storage or removable battery, no headphone jack, no face recognition, quite big and slippery This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world. Thirty nations had declared war between 1914 and 1918. Many countries along with Great Britain sided with the allies, including France, Italy, Russia, and the United States.

He did not go into detail.The INF was a “bilateral treaty in a multipolar ballistic missile world”, Bolton said, adding that no formal steps had yet been taken but that the US would exit the treaty “in due course”.The treaty, concluded in 1987, barred the United States and Russia from deploying missiles with a range from 500 to 5,500 km, and largely was credited with banishing nuclear missiles from Europe.Bolton avoided directly answering questions from press about whether “we’ll soon be seeing US missiles in Europe”, saying only that the single country constrained by the INF treaty was the United States.“It is the American position that Russia is in violation,” Bolton said at Interfax, the same press agency where he discussed US plans to withdrawal from the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2001. “Russia’s position is that they aren’t. So one has to ask how to ask the Russians to come back into compliance with something they don’t think they’re violating.”Bolton also announced that Putin would meet with Donald Trump for talks when the two leaders are in Paris next month for the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day, marking the formal end of the first world war.It will be the first meeting between the two presidents since their controversial Helsinki summit in July, and just their fourth meeting in person since Trump became president.Russia played up the meeting, with a Kremlin aide saying the talks would be “a full-fledged meeting. There will be serious preparations.”Bolton met with Putin at the Kremlin on Tuesday, where he came to explain the US exit from the INF. The Russian leader joked that the US seal showed an eagle carrying olives branches and arrows. “The question is: did your eagle already eat all the olives and only the arrows are left?”“Hopefully I’ll have some answers for you,” Bolton replied. “But I didn’t bring any more olives.”The two also discussed cooperation in Syria and accusations that Russia was meddling in US elections. Bolton on Monday said that he had confronted Russia on its elections meddling, but also said that the interference had little effect on the outcome of the 2016 elections, a view that seemed tailored to Donald Trump.“What the meddling did create was distrust and animosity within the United States,” Bolton said on Tuesday when asked about his remarks. “It made it almost impossible for the US and Russia to make progress diplomatically for two years. That’s a huge loss to both countries but mostly to Russia. It’s a message to Russia: don’t mess with American elections.”A Kremlin aide, Yuri Ushakov, on Tuesday evening said that US accusations about elections interference were “mentioned but not discussed”, according to Interfax.“In fact, both the president and Mr Bolton decided to abandon mutual accusations and hold this serious, normal substantive conversation, and they did,” he said, according to Interfax."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad9e3ab1b6fa6dbf4626b92f125ff79790d40512/0_25_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa7eaef70b1718065208c5807a6d0901","title":"new zealand deploys art of conversation to save foreign hikers lives","story":"Police and department of conservation appeal to locals to share knowledge with visitors, after a spate of avoidable deathsNew Zealanders are being called on to talk to tourists in hotels, pubs and shops to educate them about the dangers of the nation’s countryside, after a spate of emergency rescues and fatalities.New Zealand is experiencing record high tourism numbers, with many visitors heading into the bush ill-equipped to deal with the extreme New Zealand environment, memorably captured in the Crowded House song Four Seasons in One Day.According to the New Zealand Mountain Safety Council, 57 hikers, or trampers as they are called in New Zealand, died in the 10 years to June 2017, with international tourists making up close to half.Senior constable Barry Shepherd of Taupo police said locals need to “intervene” and share their local expertise with tourists, to minimise avoidable deaths.“Talk to visitors who are in your shops, petrol stations or hotels. Ask them their plans, tell them about the New Zealand weather – what cold really means here, what rain really means here,” said Shepherd.“Tell them that jeans are not acceptable in any hiking situation.

We need our visitors to thrive in our country not just survive.”Stacey Faire, who works for the Department of Conservation in Tongariro, said chatting with a local was the best form of advice for tourists. Visitors were far more likely to listen to warnings from a Kiwi than they were from signs or hiking guides and websites, she said.Don Bogie, the department’s visitor risk adviser, said social media shots of New Zealand tourists in dramatic locations were encouraging people to push themselves into terrain and conditions they were unprepared for. “All those really neat photos don’t really show you the hazards,” Bogie told RNZ.The cost of emergency rescues is paid by the taxpayer and rescues of hikers in peril are largely undertaken by volunteers.The most common issues for visitors hiking in New Zealand are underestimating the challenges of the rugged environment, failing to take enough warm or protective clothing, getting lost, and sudden, dramatic changes in weather.In the year to September 3.8 million tourists visited New Zealand 1.3 million more than a decade ago.This year the government announced it would introduce a tourist tax of NZ$25 to NZ$35 per visitor, which will be directed towards tourism infrastructure such as public toilets and conservation in the country’s national parks and conservation areas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdb98bf5012e1dca5cff4bd08cddd8265e9d7898/0_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf9b38fd43ffd443967e53e3465c14eb","title":"wednesday briefing serial rogue landlords exposed","story":"How banned operators stay in business … escalator horror in Rome … and Trump points finger at Saudi crown prince over Khashoggi murder Hello, Warren Murray here to bump-start your Wednesday.Rogue landlords banned by councils are continuing to operate, a ITV investigation has revealed. Local authorities, meanwhile, have failed to make a single entry on to the central government’s new rogue landlord database in the six months since its launch.Under existing laws, a landlord banned in one borough can continue operating in other boroughs. Or they can continue renting out homes in the borough where they are banned, so long as the lettings are managed by an approved third party. Here are some of England’s rogue landlords – we have taken an in-depth look at Bernard McGowan, whose reputed £30m business rolls on despite six Housing Act convictions since 2014. He hid in a toilet when approached for comment. Campaigners and housing researchers are calling for legal reforms including a “property MOT” in which all lettings need to have an annual standardised inspection by approved experts.Horror ride on escalator – One man had a foot severed and others were injured when an escalator accelerated to high speed before its steps collapsed at an underground station in Rome. Video showed people piling up at the bottom and scrambling to get off. Twenty people were injured, authorities said.The accident happened at Repubblica station where Russian fans were streaming through for CSKA Moscow’s Champions League game against AS Roma at the Italian capital’s Olympic Stadium. Some reports suggested the escalator broke after singing and chanting fans started to jump up and down on it.

Sources present at the meeting said some ministers demanded a time limit on keeping the UK inside EU trade and customs arrangements, while others said May should drop the time limit in order to reach agreement with Brussels.

Photograph:  Garrett White The construction firm at the centre of a controversy over fire safety and structural concerns in schools built in the last decade has been paid over €80 million by the Department of Education since 2013.Over €60 million was paid out by the department since late 2015, when fire safety issues were first raised with schools built by Western Building Systems (WBS).The firm, which built 40 schools for the department over the last decade, was regularly among the department’s top-three highest-paid construction contractors, according to financial information published by the department.While it has been at the centre of allegations of lapses in fire safety and structural concerns, it is currently involved in building Greystones Community National School in Co Wicklow and Shellybanks Educate Together in Sandymount in Dublin.Fire safety issues with schools built by WBS were first flagged in October 2015 at Rush-Lusk Educate Together primary school. Last September, the department published fire safety audits of five schools, which found construction work did not meet required standards.Following the audits, the department announced further fire safety reviews would be carried out at 25 other schools delivered by the construction firm. Since then, a further €13 million has been paid by the department to WBS.All these schools, and a further 10 built more recently, now face structural assessment inspection by officials working on behalf of the Department of Education over the coming days.The department has recently begun legal actions against WBS in relation to four schools where remedial fire safety work has been required.The Office of Public Works is involved in legal action with WBS over the construction of a building for Whitehall College of Further Education.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed in the Dáil on Tuesday that litigation was under way against the company in respect of four schools.In a statement on Tuesday, WBS said it had been operating for 35 years and “places considerable emphasis on delivering high-quality work”. The statement said “until now, our integrity has never been questioned” and that all of its school building projects had been inspected during construction. “Every time, each was certified as meeting compliance standards.”The company said it recognised fully that structural and fire safety issues in schools was a very important matter, particularly for pupils, parents and teachers in all affected schools. “We are interested in getting to the bottom of this and that starts with establishing the facts. We are moving to intensify our engagement with the department and other relevant bodies to better understand the issues which have now arisen and to work to resolve them.”The firm said it had not received all of the completed inidual school fire safety audit reports, but had responded to all but two of the reports it had received. The Tyrone-based firm reported a turnover of £37 million (€42 million) last year, according to filed financial accounts. WBS was also awarded a contract by Dublin City Council worth €4 million, to build 22 “rapid build” modular homes in Poppintree, Ballymun, which were completed in 2016. The firm began as a flat roofing company in 1982, set up by Martin McCloskey."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3673534.1540336940!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord clash between coyote casey and talking tea cosy disappoints","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential candidates Senator Joan Freeman, MEP Liadh Ní Riada, President Michael D Higgins, Seán Gallagher, Peter Casey and Gavin Duffy ahead of the debate on RTÉ’s ‘Prime Time’. Photograph: Tom Honan for The We thought it was going to be Coyote Casey versus the Talking Tea Cosy. Michael D Higgins, dodging the hits like Road Runner, with Peter Casey stalking him like Wile E Coyote, waiting for the chance to drop an anvil on the presidential head.There was a magnificent full moon over Montrose. With any luck, one of the candidates might go doolally. This was probably the main reason people tuned in to watch the latest debate in what has been a dull and uninspiring presidential election campaign.“I can certainly say I would be one of the more interesting and exciting presidents,” carolled Casey, as his fellow candidates sniggered.In the end, the scrap between Higgins and Casey didn’t live up to the advance billing. What viewers got was a more even-handed free for all, with the TV “dragons” devouring each other and the remaining three candidates staying, mainly, above the fray.As he is so far ahead on the opinion polls, and this was “the last chance debate”, there was a feeling before the off that Michael D’s rivals had no option but to go for the jugular.At the start of hostilities, Higgins was neither president nor candidate – he was a moving target. And for the first 15 minutes of the debate, he was the focus of intense questioning. First from presenter and master of the raised eyebrow, David McCullagh – who did a ruthless job as moderator – and then from the five pretenders to his job.McCullagh landed the line of the night when Seán Gallagher, who came second to Higgins in the last election, quibbled at being called a “Dragon”, conveniently ignoring the reality television show which propelled him, and his colleagues Casey and Duffy, to the election starting gate.“Perhaps in seven years time we will have three candidates from Ireland’s Fittest Family.”The continuing row over Higgins being flown in the Government jet last May to an engagement in Northern Ireland reached its entertaining peak when the volatile Casey, following through on a crunching opening tackle from his fellow reality TV star Gallagher, looked at an angelic Higgins and shouted: “He couldn’t lie straight in the bed! He couldn’t lie straight in the bed!”A pained Higgins shrieked: “My life has been about authenticity!”We closed our eyes and swore we were hearing Oliver Callan. As he shipped a lot of flak, the president eventually declared: “there are far too many innuendos flying around.” Presumably not just in the jet.Earlier, the final podium places were decided when representatives of the candidates drew lots – a bit like Winning Streak, but without the glamour. At the outset of the campaign, positioning Higgins and Gallagher side by side in the middle of the crescent of candidates would have seemed like perfect placement for a grudge match which has been seven years in the making. But that was before the recent shake-up in the rankings.The media observers were pinning their hopes for a good brawl on multi-millionaire businessman, Casey. If he didn’t launch a rocket at the President before the end of the show there was every expectation he would at least let off a few bangers. So much so that when he walked into the foyer of the Television Centre, the waiting hacks said nothing, rendered silent by their overwhelming desire for fireworks and blood on the carpet.It was all rather awkward, Casey smiling wordlessly at the reporters and the reporters blankly staring back. After the initial piling in on Higgins over the jet, the debate settled down to what was largely a row between the three male “Dragons”.The three men, stood together wearing an interchangeable dark suit. They then indulged in an interchangeable argument and spent much of the debate savaging each other, with Liadh Ní Riada and Joan Freeman lobbing in the occasional dig and Michael D standing, presidentially, above it all.Next into the firing line was Gallagher. He should have been expecting the “what have you been doing for the last seven years” haymaker. But he walked into it anyway. In the course of a lot of huffing and puffing, the businessman said it was because he had been fighting a case against RTÉ ever since his ordeal in the final debate in 2011. He pointed to one crowning achievement as a result: “as we stand here tonight, there are no live tweets coming in”.He followed up this great revelation with the sort a bewildering reply which cried out for for the attention of Joycean scholars. Gallagher, the high flyer of the last election, was shot down in flames. When he declared, rather loftily, that he is a type of social entrepreneur “providing workspace”, Gavin Duffy pointed out “you’re a commercial landlord” while Ní Riada reminded him he was “lining his pockets”.Duffy and Casey then\u0026nbspstarted headbutting each other. By the end of the debate, the business-orientated Dragons had devoured each other. Three were left standing – Higgins, Freeman and Ní Riada.Freeman struggled to get her “vision” out. It concerns her interest in mental health.“Look, I’m the expert here,” she said, not for the first time. But she did well, showing her frustration with the bickering of the businessmen. Joan said she wants to open “wellness centres” around the country if she becomes president. An hour into the debate, and we could have done with a stint in a wellness centre.Duffy expounded again on Brexit and continued to push his plan to have a Youth Corps.McCullagh then got stuck into Liadh over her claim that, as a Sinn Féin politician, she only earns the average industrial wage. She said her error was one of “semantics really” and that she should have answered the question more clearly.The programme began with a compilation of some of the saccharine mission statements emoted by the contenders. Somebody encountering the participants for the first time might have mistaken it for the opening shots of a comedy programme.It was an entertaining debate, but despite our fervent hopes, there was no rocket from Casey, who came along with a pocket full of damp squibs. Michael D Higgins will be relieved after the programme – he suffered no major hit. The two women\u0026nbspon the ticket – Freeman and Ní Riada –\u0026nbspwere also measured and more considered in their approach. They did well. But the Talking Tea Cosy, despite the predictions of a bloodbath, survived unravelled.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":null,"title":"picture editors 25 favourite images princess eugenies royal","story":"Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank kiss after their wedding on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor CastleDuchess of Sussex rushed away as visit to Fiji market cut short due to \u0026#39crowd management issues\u0026#39Surgeons operate on unborn babies for the first time ever in BritainJapanese runner completes marathon relay race with fractured legTheresa May to face down her Brexit critics at 1922 backbencher meeting after \u0026#39almighty row\u0026#39 at Cabinet Global crackdown seizes £10m of counterfeit medicines Bullying in the NHS costing the service more than £2 billion per year in England, research warnsChristmas Cathedral congregation numbers swell thanks to spiritually inquisitive, festival-going millennialsFord adverts banned after complaints that Dylan Thomas poem could encourage angry drivingBrexit must be used to protect UK\u0026#39s plants by stopping foreign species coming into the UK, RHS saysQueen speaks publicly on Brexit for first time during Dutch royal visitDonald Trump calls Khashoggi killing \u0026#39worst cover-up ever\u0026#39 as US announces penalties on suspectsThe day press freedoms received a devastating blowPolio experts \u0026#39owe it to the children of the world\u0026#39 to wipe out the diseaseComment: NDAs are the by-product, not the root cause, of abuse   How gagging orders became the MeToo war\u0026#39s weapon of choiceSchillings: The ‘attack dog’ firm that acted for Giggs, Terry and RonaldoComment: This decision will discourage exposure of oppressive workplace culturesThe British #MeToo scandal which cannot be revealedMega Millions lottery jackpot climbs to $1.6 billion - the largest in US historyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000178643251_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwMpl-Jpdv5EMZZkofEupHBFJaBQLXRCzMl9_J53bXTg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"chinas rich post photos lying face surrounded luxury goods flaunt","story":"Photographs of people surrounded by high heels, handbags, make up, and even stacks of money have gone viral on social mediaPhotos of people lying face down on the ground surrounded by luxury goods have gone viral on Chinese social media.More than a million posts of people taking part in the flaunt your wealth challenge have appeared on the platform Weibo in the last two weeks. One video, which has been viewed more than 50,000 times, shows a woman lying beside her car on a pedestrian crossing in Taizhou, Zhejiang province surrounded by scattered high heels, make up and a handbag.

There’s an element of hubris involved - combined with social media storms and the popularity of herbal and alternative approaches.”Most Europeans believe the MMR vaccine is safer than the flu vaccine“Soon we are going to get a very serious strain of flu that people have never been exposed to, they will need a vaccine,” Prof Larson added. “You can’t create a high level of understanding about vaccines during a crisis. We need to make sure people have that base understanding already.”She added that with antibiotic resistance rising, a lack of trust in vaccines could exacerbate an outbreak. France has the lowest confidence in flu vaccines, with just half of respondents agreeing they were safe - despite 70 per cent agreeing that vaccines in general were safe. In contrast, confidence in flu vaccines is high in the UK - with over 85 per cent of people believing that flu vaccines are safe. The report also found that in countries where GPs had a high confidence in vaccines, a larger proportion of people expressed positive vaccination beliefs. There are significant regional disparities in attitudes to vaccinesVytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for health and food safety, said the study confirmed the need for EU action. “As a doctor I can honestly say that vaccination is truly one of the greatest successes of public health of our time and the most cost effective tool in our hands,” he said. “Some of the key issues we need to address are fighting misinformation and the lack of awareness in the general population on the risks posed by diseases preventable through vaccination.”Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityPlease review our commenting policyDuchess of Sussex rushed away as visit to Fiji market cut short due to \u0026#39crowd management issues\u0026#39Surgeons operate on unborn babies for the first time ever in BritainJapanese runner completes marathon relay race with fractured legTheresa May to face down her Brexit critics at 1922 backbencher meeting after \u0026#39almighty row\u0026#39 at Cabinet Global crackdown seizes £10m of counterfeit medicines Bullying in the NHS costing the service more than £2 billion per year in England, research warnsChristmas Cathedral congregation numbers swell thanks to spiritually inquisitive, festival-going millennialsFord adverts banned after complaints that Dylan Thomas poem could encourage angry drivingBrexit must be used to protect UK\u0026#39s plants by stopping foreign species coming into the UK, RHS saysQueen speaks publicly on Brexit for first time during Dutch royal visitDonald Trump calls Khashoggi killing \u0026#39worst cover-up ever\u0026#39 as US announces penalties on suspectsThe day press freedoms received a devastating blowPolio experts \u0026#39owe it to the children of the world\u0026#39 to wipe out the diseaseComment: NDAs are the by-product, not the root cause, of abuse   How gagging orders became the MeToo war\u0026#39s weapon of choiceSchillings: The ‘attack dog’ firm that acted for Giggs, Terry and RonaldoComment: This decision will discourage exposure of oppressive workplace culturesThe British #MeToo scandal which cannot be revealedMega Millions lottery jackpot climbs to $1.6 billion - the largest in US historyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/17/10/projectskyline.jpg","title":"community forest treherbert welcome to our woods kifinan mull ulva","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsProject Skyline is looking at the possibility for people from the South Wales Valleys to own the land around their villageClick to followThe IndependentProject Skyline, which is exploring land ownership in the South Wales Valleys, visited community forests in Scotland in OctoberWhen Welcome to Our Woods started in the South Wales Valleys 22 years ago it had one simple aim: to stop young people from setting fire to the forest.\u0026nbspLocals from Treherbert, a former coal-mining village at the head of the Rhondda Fawr Valley, remember the forest as a no-go area. It had been planted to grow pine for pit props, the timber splints used to prop up the coal pits. After the mines closed, the forest became wild and overgrown. It was littered with burned-out cars and scarred by uncontrolled blazes that ripped across the mountains. Until two decades ago, when Ceri Nicholas, a project worker in the Valleys, had an idea to stop bored teenagers from setting it alight: start an official firepit and teach them to make fires properly.Public Service Broadcasting explore Brexit and mining on Every ValleyInside the world\u0027s most beautiful coal mineTearful miners march in farewell to Britain\u0027s last deep coal mine“There was a lot of controversy about whether he should be doing it,” says Ian Thomas, director of Welcome to Our Woods. “But we haven’t had an arson attack on the site since.”Welcome to Our Woods has transformed this patch of the Valleys. It generates income from a hydroelectric scheme, rents growing spaces in polytunnels and it’s just bought a library in the centre of Treherbert to host yoga classes, a pay as you feel cafe and other community groups. The project has also been awarded £1.2m\u0026nbspfrom Create Your Space, a Big Lottery fund that enables people to improve their natural environment.\u0026nbspThomas and his colleague Martyn Broughton, a person trainer who runs exercise and wellbeing classes for Welcome to Our Woods, joined with Project Skyline, which is looking at the possibilities for people from South Wales to manage the land around their town or village, on a recent trip to community forests in Scotland.Over the course of three days and many miles, the group from South Wales visited the Kilfinan Community Forest\u0026nbspin Tighnabruaich and the North West Mull Community Woodland Company on the Isle of Mull. Thomas had driven up to join the project through bad weather, dodging landslides that blocked some of the roads to this remote part of the Scotland.One day, after lunch of soup and sandwiches at the Bellachroy Hotel overlooking the loch, Skyline Project members listened attentively as John Addy and Ian Hepburn, directors of the company, explained how they took a nearby forest on Mull into community ownership. “When the assets are managed by the community, the conflict between regeneration and repopulation is minimised,” Hepburn said. “You only have to look at the children here. They look after the forest because they feel it is theirs.”The forest on North West Mull, which was overdue for felling, has provided an income for the group since they built 17 kilometres of roads to get the timber out. It is also home to archaeological sites, wood-fuel processing, nature trails and an eagle watch point that is popular with visitors hoping to see eagles Hope and Star and their two chicks. There are plans for nine forest “crofts” or areas of land lived on and farmed by crofter tenants on a very long time lease, plus additional plans for five affordable homes.“We don’t intend to run everything,”\u0026nbspAddy, a former marine biologist, said. “It’s about creating an opportunity for people to come in and run it.”Treherbert, a former coal-mining village at the head of the Rhondda Fawr Valley in South Wales (Courtesy Photo)This year, thanks to the success of the community forest, the group voted to buy the Isle of Ulva, a neighbouring island that was formerly owned by a private landlord.“The prospect was that the island was bought by an oligarch or a sheikh and use it as a private playground,” says Hepburn. “We were very fortunate in Scotland as there are laws for us to use, but it was still an enormous amount of paperwork.”The group were the first to employ the Scottish Land Reform Act in the sale. This creates the legal grounds to force the sale of private land to community bodies who have an interest in its sustainable development. The community raised £4.65 million to buy the island, the bulk of it from the Scottish Land Fund, with funding set aside for another two years to conduct land surveys and explore ideas for what to do next.Unlike in Scotland, there is no legal basis for communities who want to own their land in Wales. Project Skyline is the first attempt to produce a feasibility study to describe what community ownership might look like in the Valleys, with their long history of coal mining and private ownership.Thomas remembers: “The chief executive of Natural Resources Wales, when it got when it got created, stood with Ceri and said, ‘All of this land here is uneconomic. If you can think of a better idea of how to use it, tell us and we’ll work with you on it.\u0027”Thomas joined Welcome to Our Woods in 2013, just as the Forestry Commission merged with the Countryside Council and the Environment Agency to create Natural Resources Wales. The new body, which was created to manage Wales’s natural resources in a more joined-up way, was launched from the community building at Welcome to Our Woods.Scottish island can be yours for £4.2m — unless you\u0027re a billionaireSince Thomas became a director of Welcome to Our Woods, he has been keen to wean the project off the\u0026nbspgrant funding on which it relies to survive. “There are obvious opportunities that are not being realised,” he says. “We’ve got a hugely productive community, lots of tradesmen and skilled practical workers, but they leave the valley each morning in white vans driving over the mountain. This project is all about realising the very obvious opportunities that are there.”Thomas can already see the impact that Welcome to Our Woods is having in the community. Every Thursday afternoon, volunteers create space for people with mental health issues to come and spend time outdoors, weaving, enjoying the fire, drinking tea and chatting. Its at these quiet moments that Thomas knows they’re on the right track: “I look up at all these different things going on and I think, ‘This is right.’Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That’s where the foundations are being laid, shifting the focus from expansion and quantity to quality of early childhood education and care,” he said.Grammar schools ‘damage social mobility’ and should be ‘phased out’May faces major setback as social mobility tsar quits with his teamRobots are putting social mobility at risk, report warnsThe report indicates more than two-thirds of the achievement gap observed at age 15 and about two-thirds of the gap among 25 to 29-year-olds was already seen among 10-year-olds.Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the social mobility charity the Sutton Trust, told The Independent:\u0026nbsp“It is extremely worrying to see that poorer students are almost three years behind their better off peers in science.\u0026nbsp“Our research has shown that there is a lack of qualified specialist science teachers in state schools, and that this shortfall is disproportionately affecting disadvantaged pupils. But education gaps open up early, and the focus in early years nursery provision should be on quality and not quantity.”He added: “High quality teaching is the most important way to improve the attainment of disadvantaged pupils.\u0026nbspEnsuring that pupils from all backgrounds have access to high quality teaching is crucial for social mobility.\u0026nbsp“Teachers should be incentivised to work in schools with high levels of disadvantage. School admissions processes should be reviewed so more pupils from less well-off backgrounds have access to top schools. Improving the quality of teaching in all schools is vital.”The report also found that only 15 per cent of UK disadvantaged students are satisfied with their lives, do not suffer from test anxiety and feel socially integrated at school – which is less than the average (26 per cent) across all developed countries analysed.This figure for “social and emotional resilience” is far below a number of countries including the Netherlands (50 per cent), Switzerland (43 per cent) and Finland (39 per cent), the OECD found.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, called the report “alarming”.He said: “Despite the improving standards in schools and two decades of sustained effort, narrowing the gap between richer and poorer students is taking too long.“Rightly, schools are at the centre of the efforts that we make to narrow the gap. But it would be wrong to expect schools to solve the problem on their own. The issues that underpin inequality reach far beyond the school gates and exist throughout the communities that schools serve.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Thousands of female workers have today taken to the streets of Glasgow over an equal pay dispute with the City CouncilFormer politan Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe who has called for an urgent review of the evidence around legislation of cannabis.

Earlier this year the education secretary also set out his plans to boost social mobility by improving education support for children before they start school.Through green paper proposals, we will provide significant additional resources for all schools to help identify mental health problems early and make sure young people have the right support when they need it.

Chief among those are a new dark mode that turns the screen black and so makes the app easier to look at.People will also be able to add custom nicknames, emoji and colours to each of their chats, which the site says will make it easier to follow inidual chats.The central part of the new app is three tabs: Chats, People and Discover. The app opens on Chats, which contains all of the messages you have sent to normal people People will include friends, stories and a list of people who are online at that moment and Discover will feature everything else, such as businesses, games and ways of following the news.The redesign has included re-writing the Messenger app from the bottom up to make its code more simple. That has made it easier to add new features – like dark mode, which will arrive in the near future – and Facebook says that more will be coming in the future, too.Facebook Messenger on the desktop – which, unlike the app, is accessible from within the main Facebook website – will not be changed for now and so will keep the current look.The new design will be rolled out gradually to users around the world, in part to ensure that the changes are not too sudden.\u0026nbspIt can take time to get used to a new way to use an app you rely on every day, which is why we\u0027re rolling out Messenger 4 in phases, the company said in a blog post.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As they did, they pushed out oxygen, changing the atmosphere and filling it with the gas that allowed living things to survive.But that doesn\u0027t happen on the surface of Mars. There is only small bits of oxygen around, and so scientists feared that there might not be life on the surface.Bacteria found 600m underground \u0027hint at alien life on Mars\u0027But a new study, published in\u0026nbspNature Geoscience, used computer models to explore the briny lakes underneath the Mars surface. And it found there might be oxygen lurking in those pools.The new study found that the amount of oxygen in that briny surface could be enough to support aerobic life, according to the authors.That oxygen is especially concentrated at the poles of the planet, the authors write. And they could help explain how the mysterious oxidized rocks found on Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspsurface might have formed.The\u0026nbspstudy comes after\u0026nbspscientists announced this summer that they had found a vast lake underneath the Martian surface, in a major breakthrough for the search for alien life. That discovery helped settle the long debate about whether the planet had any water at all – and the new research will add to hopes that those pools could contain life.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.Images taken during that trip show what is known as a tabular iceberg. Unlike the iconic shape that might be full of crags and breaks, such objects are distinguished by their long flat tops and clean-cut edges – and can extend hundreds of miles wide, as well as reaching deep beneath the surface.The tabular icebergs form when their weight snaps them off from the ice shelves they were once part of, often breaking off with the kind of clean precision as seen in the new image. They can then drift off on their own, and might smash apart once they do into the more rough-looking icebergs that are famous for sinking the titanic.Though a mile-wide might sound like a lot, icebergs formed by calving events such as this can actually be far more vast, and this might even be a relatively small specimen. Last summer, a different iceberg known as A-68 detached from the same Larsen C ice shelf – and that had a surface area of over 2,000 miles, with much of its giant size being underwater.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They found a series of signs that suggested black holes are closely orbiting each other.Before black holes fully merge together, they form what is known as a binary black hole, swirling around each other in orbit before they eventually get close and smash into each other. Scientists have spotted evidence of smaller black holes crashing into each other since 2015, by measuring the gravitational waves that are sent out into the universe.But scientists haven’t yet been able to see evidence of the bigger, supermassive binary black holes.Now scientists have examined the powerful jets that are thrown out by supermassive black holes. As the binary black holes orbit each other, the jet coming out will occasionally change direction – by mapping those as they change, scientists can confirm that those binary black holes do exist.“We have studied the jets in different conditions for a long time with computer simulations,” said\u0026nbspMartin Krause, lead author and senior lecturer in Astronomy at the University of Hertfordshire.\u0026nbsp”In this first systematic comparison to high-resolution radio maps of the most powerful radio sources, we were astonished to find signatures that were compatible with jet precession in three quarters of the sources.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

Jobs will be lost and supply chains moved.“The knock-on effect for the UK economy would be significant.

She also held bilateral meetings with the leaders of\u0026nbspSingapore\u0026nbspand Korea.The EU and Singapore are set to sign a trade deal that will reduce barriers between the two countries.

I just went for the one that I liked the best on the night.”A spokesperson for the BBC has said: “It is categorically untrue to imply that producers tell the Judges how to score or who to save. Each judge votes on each dance independently, based on its merits and in their expert opinion alone. The Judges use an electronic voting pad to transmit their score or choice of who to save to the production gallery which is then locked in and cannot be changed.”“Only after this does a Producer speak to the judges, advising them on how long they have to speak and reminding them to give a reason for their decisions.

Campaigners argue that could force companies\u0026nbspto ban memes that use pictures or gifs from existing media, and that it could damage the way that social networks operate.EU parliament approves copyright rules that could be \u0027catastrophic\u0027Opposition to the rules has united copyright campaigners and the major internet platforms, which have argued that it could undermine the very way the internet\u0026nbspworks. Now YouTube has spoken out in perhaps the most passionate comments from the tech industry yet.The company said that YouTube could be forced to stop allowing normal users to upload videos, instead concentrating them in the hands of a small number of big companies. Viewers in the EU could be blocked from viewing some videos and small creators could be ruined, the company said.Ms\u0026nbspWojcicki\u0026nbspwrote that article 13 threatens to shut down the ability of millions of people –\u0026nbspfrom creators like you to everyday users –\u0026nbspto upload content to platforms like YouTube, in a letter written to the site\u0027s community of video creators. It threatens to block users in the EU from viewing content that is already live on the channels of creators everywhere, she wrote.The new rules also threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs, she said.The proposal could force platforms, like YouTube, to allow only content from a small number of large companies, she wrote.\u0026nbsp​It would be too risky for platforms to host content from smaller original content creators, because the platforms would now be directly liable for that content.Article 13 is just one part of a sweeping set of copyright rules that proponents claim will help fight against the theft and reuse of videos and music. Another controversial part of the rules is article 11, which will create a link tax and mean that sites like Google could have to pay to show a snippet of the websites they link out to.EU lawmakers have voted through the new rules and their wording could be finalised by the end of the year. The directive is expected to go into force soon after that.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I don\u0027t think they will want to be moving away from their commitment.It comes after Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs she could not accept the EU\u0027s original backstop plan as it would mean imposing controls on goods traded between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, creating a customs border down the Irish Sea.She is now demanding a time-limited solution to the vexed issue of the Irish border.While she was ready to explore every possible option to break the impasse, she said a critical first step should be a legally-binding agreement on a temporary UK-EU joint customs territory to avoid the need for a Northern Ireland-only backstop.

reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004208757051-e1532011560868.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"no deal brexit explained house prices advice","story":"Some have warned of chaoswe crash out without an agreement -

but Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked fury by saying we would pay up even without a deal.Many people fear the UK economy would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.Doom-monger Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned house prices could crash by a third in a worst-case scenario.Customs checks on cross-Channel freight could cause havoc at ports, hitting food supplies and other goods such a motor parts.In a pure no-deal scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.A no deal would also see residency rights for EU nationals in the UK potentially disappear overnight.In theory, these people would become third country nationals, meaning they would be subject to domestic immigration rules.There is also uncertainty over what would happen at the  mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.The government is releasing a series of Technical notices to help prepare British businesses and consumers for a no-deal scenario.A second tranche of papers has now been released by the validity of British driving licences on the continent, roaming charges for mobile phones and the future of the European space and satellites programmes.Anyone travelling to the EU should make sure they have at least six months left on their passport, although that will not apply to travel in Ireland.People applying for a new passport after Brexit will continue to get burgundy passports for a while - although they will not say European Union on the front coverBlue passports will start being issued from late The papers show:The government has released a set of contingency plans outlining the impact of a no-deal Brexit.The  technical notices’ drawn up by Whitehall cover areas including free trade agreements after the split, fishing policy and rail transport.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the Government is still striving to strike a good deal with Brussels, but added the documents showed the “unlikely” prospect of no-deal is being taken seriously.The latest batch of documents reveal how the UK will immediately regain control of its waters in a no-deal scenario.Here are the recent big Brexit developments:"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT0004431105532.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"right to ignore peoples vote","story":"We have had a “people’s vote”.

So is Hammond’s next door.Whoever takes over — Boris, David Davis or Jeremy Hunt — needs an emergency clear-out.The big guns of the Treasury need to be pointed at the “enemy” not its own side.After two long, wasted years, Britain is engaged in an unexpectedly desperate fight, not just to salvage Brexit but to save British democracy.Weekend crowds demanding a second referendum seem oblivious to the threat such a crazy re-run would pose to this nation’s centuries-old stability, ironically the envy of Europe.We cannot reverse the  referendum without turning Brexit into a perpetual running sore. And Britain can never rejoin the EU except on its knees.The only way to put this corrosive issue to bed is for Brexit to succeed — as it will, despite treacherous Tony Blair and Facebook hypocrite Nick Clegg.To succeed as we must we need a new chancellor as well as a new prime minister.Diehard Remainer Phil Hammond should be first out the door.It was Spreadsheet Phil who vetoed vital preparations for No Deal — now a better-than - prospect with time rapidly running out.And it was Hammond who surrendered the one negotiating weapon Brussels fears most — a thriving, low-tax Britain competing with the EU on its doorstep.Our economic fate is entirely in our hands. We can make taxes and tarfs as competitive as we like.Better investment incentives and lower corporation tax rates would trigger a flood of foreign investment in UK plc — and ensure car makers like Nissan and Toyota never leave our shores.Yet the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has ruled them out.“Phil is like those Harry Potter Dementor creatures,” says a top Tory. “He sucks the le out of any room he happens to be in.”Hammond is easily replaced. Michael Gove, an ex-future PM but a formidable Cabinet minister, has the drive and imagination to take on the Treasury “Blob”.There is no shortage of Brexit talent on the Tory benches.Just compare thundering Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC with prissy dried-stick predecessor Dominic Grieve.Grieve is busy sabotaging Brexit. Cox finds ways to make it work.He is now “marking Number Ten’s homework” on Mrs May’s wretched Northern Ireland “backstop”.Some even tip him as a dark horse in the leadership stakes.There is one other big change needed at the heart of Britain’s Brexit team.Our next PM must have a new EU negotiator.Nobody could be worse than Olly Robbins, already reportedly eyeing up a £m-a-year golden parachute into a top City job.Lelong Europhile Robbins has led Mrs May into so many disastrous EU traps — especially her humiliation in Salzburg — he is often cast as an EU “double agent”.It was Robbins who told EU negotiator Michel Barnier that Britain might stay indefinitely in “transition” while the fantasy Northern Ireland backstop was sorted out.And pay £bn more on top of the £bn ransom for the privilege.The idea that Robbins is the “EU’s man in Whitehall” is not such a stretch when you consider his Jeremy Corbyn-style applause for Communist Russia.Kremlin leaders, he told fellow Oxford students in , “changed Russia from a backward peasant autocracy, despised by the West, into a technological giant at whom the world cowered in fear for half a century.”Everyone is entitled to youthful naivety.But can anyone imagine Olly Robbins fighting our corner for EU democracy and accountability, let alone the referendum verdict of .m Brexit-voting Brits SAUDI Arabia’s rulers must be really annoyed with dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.This elderly trouble maker walked alone into his country’s Turkish consulate knowing he might never emerge alive.He was clearly looking for trouble.Once inside, using his bare hands, he attacked a gang of  innocent Saudi torturers who had just flown in for a couple of hours’ holiday armed only with a bone saw and a hypodermic syringe.Then, to the embarrassment of kindly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he went and hid his own body.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I didn’t reply at the time but I’m going to give Sun readers the answer now – and it’s very simple.None of this is about me. It’s all about you.That’s why, when I’m confronted with tough choices during the Brexit negotiations, I don’t think about what the implications are for me. Instead, I ask myself what it means for you, for your family and for the whole of the United Kingdom.Am I bringing back control of your money, your borders and your laws Am I protecting your jobs and making sure nothing gets in the way of our brilliant entrepreneurs and small businesses Am I protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom And, above all, am I delivering the Brexit that the people of this country so clearly voted for I need to be able to answer “Yes” to every one of these questions.Andthat means there are some dficult days in Brussels, well that’s just something I have to deal with.Because the Brexit talks are not about me or my personal fortunes. They’re about the national interest – and that means making the right choices, not the easy ones.Inevitably, that will take time. Brexit is the UK’s biggest constitutional change for generations. Unpicking more than  years of treaties, agreements and laws would be a challenge under any circumstances and, as no country has ever left the EU before, it’s not asthere’s an instruction manual for those either side of the negotiating table to follow.I know it can seem like the talks are never-ending, and that many of you have been frustrated by the endless back and forth on technical points – I certainly feel that way sometimes too.But with five months to go until we leave the EU, we have already reached agreement on the vast majority of our exit deal.What became clear at last week’s meeting in Brussels is that the very last stages of the talks are going to be the hardest of all.This includes dealing with the so-called “backstop”: making sure that, no matter what our new relationship with Europe looks like, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.I’ve been very clear that this must be achieved without creating any kind of border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK – doing so would undermine our precious Union and put at risk the hard-won peace.So I am working closely with my counterparts in Europe to explore every possible solution to the border issue.Does that mean I think this negotiation will get tougher before we reach our goal  YesDo I have some long and dficult days ahead  I’m sure I do.But what I’m thinking about is not how hard it all is today.I’m thinking about the prize that lies before us tomorrow about the great opportunities the Government will help open up for you once we clear the last few hurdles.As we enter the final, crucial phase of the talks there will undoubtedly be some unexpected challenges to which we must rise.But the finish line is in sight. And I am more determined than ever that we will get there together, with a Brexit deal that’s right for you, right for your family and right for our country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Smoking tobacco is bad news.But vaping is dferent.You heat up a solution called an e-liquid, which typically contains nicotine, a propellant called propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin and flavourings.What you don’t do is burn tobacco or produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of the most harmful elements of all in tobacco smoke.Sure, some vapes may contain a fraction of some of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but they are present at much lower levels,detectable at all.So are they safe  According to all the international medically-reviewed evidence from such expert organisations as Public Health England, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and General Practitioners, the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK, e-cigarettes are at least  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes.The American Cancer Society and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine both agree with them.Yes, the nicotine, of course, is addictive. But so what  So is caffeine, even eating.Contrary to popular belief, nicotine does not give you cancer and it is relatively harmless generally.Apparently only  per cent of the population know this.Happily, there is no evidence of harm to other people from vaping and,used instead of nicotine replacement gum or patches, may even help expectant mums remain smoke-free in the long term.As a doctor I don’t want any young person or non-nicotine user to try vaping. Ever. Period.As it happens, regular use of e-cigs among “never” smokers is still very rare at just . per cent.But look at what they’ve done to help tobacco smokers quit.In the UK, .million vapers have quit smoking completely and more than , have given up both smoking and vaping.In fact, this is Britain’s most popular method of quitting with two-thirds stopping successfully when used alongside professional stop-smoking NHS support.In this country we have some of the strictest regulations in the world.E-cigs are subject to minimum standards of quality and safety as well as clear packaging and labelling requirements.All ingredients have to be notied, advertising is prohibited in media such as television, newspapers and magazines, it is illegal to sell them to under s and to adults intending to pass them on to under s.That is responsible regulation whichever way you look at it.This month’s national Stoptober campaign recommends using e- cigarettes as a stop-smoking aid andit helps some of the million smokers in the UK kick the habit for good then perhaps doctors like me will see fewer people in our surgeries struggling to breath or devastated by a cancer diagnosis.AndI see any ex-smoking patients of mine having a quiet vape outside my surgery door, I shall give them a heartfelt pat on the back and cherish the fact that there will be one less nasty fag end polluting the street.NICOTINE contained in e-liquids is a highly addictive substance that raises blood pressure and spikes your adrenalin, increasing the chances of having a heart attack.This is particularly worrying as we see a number of iniduals who are constantly vaping, especially as it is seen as more convenient and cost-effective than lighting up a cigarette, as well as being considered more socially acceptable to vape indoors.While vaping appears to be safer than cigarettes, the truth is that it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know the potential damage it can cause to our health.The long-term effects of the chemicals contained in e-liquids haven’t been examined.However, I have looked into ious research that has been carried out on certain e-liquids that were found to contain substances that can cause damage to the immune system and are linked to other health conditions such as cancer.Vaping isn’t great for your oral health either.It’s common for vaping to cause a dry mouth, and I’ve met a number of iniduals who have developed oral thrush, most likely caused by vaping.Although nicotine does not have a colour, it becomes yellow when combined with oxygen which could lead to tooth discolouration.As nicotine is a vasocon-strictor, it limits blood flow in oral tissue, which can cause gum disease and bad breath.As time goes on, I am reading new research which proves vaping has a negative effect on health.To what extent, only time will tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why do they not get paid what they are worth to their company, and why are so many overlooked for promotion The sad fact is that for every £ men earn, women make just  pence.Just over one in ten women negotiated their starting salary, while more than half of all men haggle with their boss before they have even started work.When women do ask for more pay, they are  per cent less likely to get a raise. Andthey do receive a wage increase it will be  per cent less than men get.Sadly, it is common in business that women are often viewed as weak or unable to cope. And once we think about or start a family, we become toxic to employers.I receive hundreds of direct messages on social media from women asking: “How do I get a pay rise  How do I get noticed at work  How can I get promoted  How can I get on after maternity leave ”So now I am launching Get What You Want, a series of online masterclasses and podcasts covering everything from getting promoted to dealing with the word no, overcoming challenges, negotiating pay, writing a fantastic CV and nailing an interview.It will also cover baby-proofing careers, as well as becoming a super-mum after maternity leave.A lot of women have skills but just lack confidence. As women, we don’t shout about our wins enough for fear we will appear arrogant, even though men talk about them all the time.Here are some of my tips to winning at work.When people say: “I hate my job” I always ask: “Why are you telling me  I can’t do anything about it.”YOU have to do something. Sit down and work out what it is you don’t like about the position and set yourself a task of getting a new one.Be very dedicated and very professional and excel when you get to the interview.Many people don’t realise that when you are invited for an interview it is because they believe you can do the job.The secret is convincing them that you can do the job better than anyone .You should be able to talk about your specialist subject, which is yourself.People find it very dficult to list all the things they have done really well in a professional way to show good examples of why they can do the job.Opening a negotiation is all about knowing your worth.And knowing your value is really about your self-worth. They are totally linked.Write down all the things where you have made a big ­contribution, all the things that you have changed and made a dference, how you have added value. Put together testimonials to really back up what you have done.Then work out what more you want to do, because going above and beyond your job description is very important.Take out all the emotion, go in and lay out for your boss the facts of what you’ve contributed to the organisation.Sometimes people can be very passive. They say: “I’ll go along with what everyone  agrees with.”They want to avoid conflict. They don’t really think their opinion is as important as other people’s, so they are simply giving others a licence to ignore them.Learn to say no. Say: “I don’t really have the time butI can make the time I can do it for you.” Otherwise you become like a human sponge. Don’t let them take advantage.Employers take advantage of women’s lack of confidence, especially a mother ing from maternity leave. Many feel so grateful to have a job that they tend to put up with almost anything.Eleven per cent of new mothers report that they have been dismissed or made redundant where others in their workplace were not, or were treated so poorly they felt they had to leave.That means as many as , women are losing their jobs each year.Have a really clear plan of how you will manage at home and manage work.

Ms Knightley, who adds, “Rescue yourself,” clearly feels she is protecting daughter Edie by banning something that doesn’t concur with her own off-the-shelf, Poundland version of what feminism should be.But what she’s in danger of doing is wilfully nurturing a potential “snowflake” who, rather than develop the critical thinking skills that allow healthy debate, will simply stick their fingers in their ears and cry foul when they see or hear something that dfers from their own world view.Keira, tonight’s homework is to really readCinderella and analyse it.Look past the Disney-esque cute rodents, pretty frocks and glass slippers and instead dig a little deeper to ­appreciate the original’s narrative of how hope can turn unjust oppression into ­triumphant reward.Cinderella is a young woman who has not only suffered the loss of her loving father, but now faces a letime of abuse from an uncaring stepmother and her equally unpleasant daughters.But instead of sitting in the ashes ­waiting unquestioningly for whatever fate might have in store for her, she remains resolutely ­optimistic and decides to secretly defy her nemesis by gatecrashing a hot-ticket party to which she hasn’t been invited.Now that’s girl power.Ultimately, she “‘rescues” herself by proactively going to the ball where, instead of abuse, she experiences the redemptive qualities of love and kindness.They just happen to come in the form of a handsome prince.In the same week, Kristen Bell — who coincidentally voices Anna in the Disney film Frozen — found herself caught up in the slipstream of Keira’s PC virtue signalling after reportedly saying that Snow White gives young girls the wrong ­message about consent “because you cannot kiss someonethey’re sleeping”.Except Kristen’s comment was taken out of context and she’s got the balance right.Because what she actually said was that she reads the story with her two ­daughters, aged five and three, then asks them: “Don’t you think it’s weird that Snow White didn’t ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple ” before starting up a conversation about the dos and don’ts of taking food from strangers.Or, “Don’t you think that it’s weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission ” to float an almost subliminal, age-appropriate understanding of what does and doesn’t constitute ­consent.Kristen isn’t banning tales of old, she’s using them to stimulate discussions.In other words, teaching her children the vital le skills of critical thinking — dictionary definition: “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment” — and being able to rationally debate that judgment with someone whose view might dfer from your own.Attempting to sanitise a child’s world by airbrushing history will hinder, not help them.Instead, wield history’s lessons as a tool to educate.Cinderella was of its time and now the Disney pendulum has seemingly swung the other way to depict a world where all the central characters are feisty, opinionated young women who power-kick their way through le.But how will Keira’s daughter know how far the depiction of Disney ­princesses has comeshe’s not allowed to see where they’ve been ONE morning last week, I spent a glorious couple of hours walking around Westminster Abbey.Buried or commemorated there are, among others, more than , great Britonsincluding Sir Isaac Newton, Jane Austen, Noel Coward, Charles Darwin, the Bronte sisters, Clement Attlee, Charles Dickens, David Livingstone, Stephen Hawking and, of course, the grave of the unknown warrior, buried on November ,  “in honour of the many multitudes who during the Great War of - gave the most that man can give . . . le itself.”My mother works at the Abbey as a “blue-gowner” – the volunteer guides there to answer any questions not covered by the electronic headsets – and, while showing us the ft by ft grave of poet Ben Jonson, who is the only person there to be buried upright, she was approached by a couple of earnest-looking women in their early twenties.Amid such a rich seam of history, rigorous intellect and achievement, what did they ask “Excuse me, where did David Beckham sit for the royal wedding ”THE number of stay-at-home dads has dropped to the lowest level in five years.Experts reckon it could be due to men “growing tired” of the tough job of raising kids.Proof,needed, might be the glassy-eyed expression of Bond actor Daniel Craig,  just six weeks after we Rachel Weisz gave birth to their daughter.He never looks this knackered when he’s jumping off buildings and dodging bullets.Stay-at-home parenthood can be isolating, sometimes dull, frequently thankless and relentlessly bloody exhausting. Only the strong survive it.THANKS to Ryanair’s ­astonishing failure to act when a passenger racially abused Windrush immigrant Delsie Gayle on one of its flights, the man will likely escape prosecution because of jurisdictional issues once a plane takes off from one country’s airspace to another.Instead, he is likely only to be banned from ever travelling on Ryanair again.Which, as plenty of the budget airline’s past ­customers might tell you, could equally be regarded as a blessing rather than a punishment.COMEDIAN Seann Walsh and his Strictly partner Katya Jones have survived the dreaded dance-off to, presumably, jive another day.Because, let’s face it, since that snog, the Strictly bosses are ­rapidly running out of drearily chaste dances to give them.Last weekend it was the unsexy Charleston, ­performed in equally unsexy “Where’s Wally” outfits that virtually screamed “nothing to see here”.

She is a very busy woman.“I know she had been travelling between Portsmouth, Kent and somewhere near Guildford in Surrey.“We know she was connected to at least three areas.“In Portsmouth she was with her eldest sons, and when in Kent she was with her ex-partner.“They were sharing the children, that’s what I know.“When near Guildford she was seeing a man.

He did the best for them.” Another neighbour, Joe Thomas, described Ben as an “extremely family-oriented man”.He added: “He adores his children and is a great bloke. He’s the local taxi driver and gives lts to people to help them out.“He’s really into his Nerf gun wars, and he would play shooting games with his children.”One of the last sightings of Sarah — who friends describe as a “bubbly” and “friendly” mum — was on the morning she disappeared.Fellow parents at the school gates told The Sun how she appeared fine as they shared a laugh.One dad said: “She made a joke and she was really happy and smiley, not acting strangely or like she was going to disappear.”His partner said: “Sarah was a lovely mum and utterly attentive to her children.”She added that she was “shocked” when Sarah moved back in with her ex in the summer.She said: “Whether her and Ben ended up rekindling things I don’t know, but we never saw them together.”Police have spent several days searching her home as well as trawling through social media and dating sites for clues.She was known to have been hunting for love online over the summer and friends believe this is how she met her new man.Officers have also used drones and dogs to search an area of woods they have cordoned off near her and Ben’s £, terraced home.Over the weekend, police also searched land and fields by a nearby private hospital and pub, and woodland in Ridley, about two miles away from where she lived.Yesterday, search teams moved to Foxborough Woods, Hartley, around a mile from her street.Despite her connections in other counties, Kent Police say no other forces are involved in the investigation.Sarah’s oldest son Lewis has put out several appeals on social media, which have been shared thousands of times.He described his mum’s disappearance as completely out of character, saying that she was “happy, with no problems”.He said that the day before she went missing, she had also found out she had got a new job, adding: “So everything was great”.Kent resident Neil Howick, , who has been using his drone to search woodland, said: “Everybody in the area will continue to work hard to try to find her.”One of the most confused of Sarah’s friends is Katherine ­Grfiths, , who had been due to speak to her about a long-planned girls’ day out.“This is so out of character for her,” she said. “She always put the children first.

The PM, who faces mounting pressure for a breakthrough in talks with Brussels, was forced to listen to the King of the Netherlands urge her to lt the “shadow of uncertainty” hanging over Dutch nationals living in Britain after Brexit. It “truly saddens us” to see the UK quit the EU, admitted Willem-Alexander, who is on a State Visit to Britain. Speaking in the Royal Gallery in the Palace of Westminster, with Mrs May in the front row, he said , Dutch citizens in Britain and , Britons living in the Netherlands deserved “special attention” during negotiations. “Many of them have lived and worked here for many years,” the royal warned. “They feel at home in their local community and their contribution to society is valued, whether as employees, colleagues, neighbours or volunteers. “Every day they prove how good the match is between the British and the Dutch. “Yet all these iniduals now live under the shadow of uncertainty about their future status. “I understand how dficult this is for them and I trust this uncertainty will be resolved.” Earlier, Irish PM Leo Varadkar called for a solution to the backstop row aimed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic in the event of a no-deal exit. “From our point of view, what Ireland is looking for is what we have always been looking for from day one and what has been committed to by us and the UK Government in principle and in writing on a number of occasions now,” said Mr Varadkar.

On Tuesday reports claimed that body parts of journalist Jamal Khashoggi have been found in a Saudi diplomat’s garden in Turkey.We have uncovered the extravagant junkets enjoyed by British politicians at the hands of the country blamed for the murder which has shocked the world. Former ministers and a close aide to Prime Minister Theresa May are among MPs who have enjoyed luxury hotels, business class flights and opulent hospitality in the country accused of having one of the worst human rights records in the world.  The kingdom’s rulers were already facing fierce criticism for its war on Yemen, persecution of political opponents and a spate public executions even before the alleged execution of Mr Khashoggi in the country’s Turkish embassy earlier this month. On Monday MPs lined up in the House of Commons to condemn Saudi regime for their response to the allegations. But the Mirror has found that Saudi gts to Tories have risen ten-fold since the party came to power. In the six years before , the regime funded just seven trips for five MPs costing nearly pound,. Since   Tory MPs enjoyed trips worth pound, and six Labour MPs were entertained at a cost of pound,. Some MPs enjoyed multiple trips.  A Conservative party spokesman said: “All visits have been declared and registered in accordance with Parliamentary rules.” But Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Jon Trickett: “This list of shame shows just how cosy the Tories are with the Saudi regime and helps explain why they’re so reluctant to speak out about human rights abuses and the war in Yemen.” Over the same period, six Labour MPs have been entertained in Saudi Arabia on trips that cost pound,. Ryvka Barnard, senior militarism and security campaigner at the British anti-poverty charity War on Want said: “Some  million people in Yemen are facing starvation and thousands have been killed in relentless attacks by the Saudi-led coalition, fuelled by billions of pounds worth of British weapons exports. “The UK’s export control policy,properly applied, would result in a de facto arms embargo on Saudi Arabia because of war crimes committed by the regime.  But weapons continue to flow to Saudi Arabia because too many British politicians lack the political will to uphold the rules, stop the arms exports, and end this horrible violence. “This isn’t just negligence, it’s collusion lavish trips and rolling out the red carpet is just one aspect of the murky world of lobbyists who act on behalf of big business and corrupt regimes to wield an unhealthy influence on Parliamentarians. “MPs should be pressing the government to end its complicity in the war crimes committed by the Saudi regime by suspending all arms exports to Saudi Arabia.”  Seema Kennedy, parliamentary private secretary to Theresa May told Parliament that “the behaviour of Saudi has changed” three months before accepting a pound, “parliamentary fact finding” trip to the Middle East kingdom, funded by the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As an example, she claimed that “it will no longer use cluster bombs”. After two free trips to Saudi Arabia costing pound,, MP Kwasi Kwarteng told Parliament in : “I do not dispute that the Saudis have, at times, been overbearing and acted ultra vires, as we used to say—beyond their authority—and that civilians have been killed. That is greatly to be regretted, and it is an appalling violation … but I do not believe that suspending the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia would help this country.” Leo Doherty MP, who has also enjoyed two trips costing the Saudis pound,, asked Theresa May in the Commons in March: “Does she agree that the kingdom is in fact a force for tremendous stability in a very turbulent region ”  Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington MP told Parliament in : “The Government’s judgment remains that a strong relationship with Saudi Arabia helps us to keep this country both prosperous and safe. It is in working with Saudi Arabia that we can encourage the changes we would like to see in that country.” In , he accepted a pound, trip to visit Saudi political leaders. Two months after a trip to Saudi in , David Amess MP said in Parliament: “I hope that the Foreign Secretary will continue to nurture good relations with Saudi Arabia.”  After a pound, trip to Saudi in , Simon Hoare MP told the House of Commons “Saudi Arabia is going through self-authored and hugely welcome modernisation and change.” Two months later, he accepted a second trip costing pound, to meet the King of Saudi Arabia, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. Six of the  Tory MPs who accepted Saudi hospitality since  are no longer sitting in the House of Commons. In April, five Labour MPs enjoyed a four day trip which cost pound, each. They went guests of the country’s Shura Council, which advises the king, to ‘discuss issues of mutual concern’. One, Mike Gapes, said he had a “long had an interest in the Middle East and the Arab world”.  Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition battling Houthi rebels in Yemen in a war which has left more than , civilians dead, according to Amnesty International, and up to , children at risk of dying from malnutrition, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund. Human Rights Watch said earlier this year that: “Saudi authorities continued their arbitrary arrests, trials, and convictions of peaceful dissidents. “Dozens of human rights defenders and activists continued to serve long prison sentences for criticizing authorities or advocating political and rights reforms.” Since , more than  prisoners have been beheaded by sword in the kingdom, sometimes in public and many for non-violent drugs offences. Activist Waleed Abu al-Khair is serving a -year sentence after Saudi Arabia’s terrorism court convicted him in  for peaceful criticism in interviews and on social media of human rights abuses. Blogger Ra Badawi was sentenced to  years in prison and , lashes for setting up a liberal website and allegedly insulting religious authorities. He was flogged  times in January .

Writing exclusively for the Mirror, the Lib Dem leader and former Coalition Business Secretary urges Theresa May to halt the flagship benefit overhaul until problems are fixed. Mr Cable blasts the Prime Minister’s “stubborn unwillingness to fix glaring flaws in its design”, adding: “The result is a slow-motion disaster.” But the frontbencher believes the theory behind rolling six welfare benefits into a single payment is still right. He says: “It doesn’t have to be like this. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. “The Conservatives’ failure to competently implement universal credit should not blind us to its inherent merits. “The Liberal Democrats supported UC in principle because we believed in its aim of simplying our convoluted welfare system and making work pay for those on benefits. “While the current Government’s handling of UC has left it on le support, Liberal Democrats argue that with a pause followed by some major reforms, the system could yet be salvaged.” Universal Credit was trumpeted by the Coalition when it was pushed through in the Welfare Reform Act  amid claims it would make work pay. But the shake-up, which begins to be widened to .million welfare claimants from July, has been hit by repeated setbacks and delays.  Ministers have now been forced to slow the pace of the roll-out. Then Chancellor George Osborne stripped poundbillion from its budget after the Tories won a majority in . Experts have since raised fears it will hammer the household finances of hard-up families. The Mirror launched our Stop the Universal Credit Cruelty campaign a fortnight ago setting out three options: redesign UC to be fit for purpose axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable or introduce a brand new system. More than , people have already signed the petition. In a speech to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Mr Cable will outline “three specic changes my party are arguing for in financial terms over and above the reforms in the way UC operates”. A single system replacing six benefits: Child and Working Tax Credits, Housing Benefits, Income Support, Jobseekers’ Allowance, and Employment and Support Allowance. It was launched in  as the pet project of Tory Iain Duncan Smith supposedly to make work pay. Who claims it  Low earners, those out of work and the sick or disabled. Already , people are on UC - % of benefit claimants. It is being rolled out to inidual Jobcentres including  in October . What are the problems  Debt-ridden claimants must wait six weeksfor their first payment, with % waiting longer than that and % waiting ten weeks in late . Research also suggests overall, UC leaves many working families worse off than the old system. That is because payments taper away at p for every pound claimants earn. The timetable has also been put back nine times since  after a string of glitches and will only be fully complete in late . They include reversing cuts to the work allowance worth around poundbillion a year, “which Joseph Rowntree Foundation analysis suggests would boost the budgets of . million parents and children - . million of them in working poverty, and take , people out of poverty”. He will also demand “improvements to universal credit for the , self-employed who will eventually claim the benefit, by extending the period before the ‘minimum income floor’ cap kicks in from  to  months and averaging income over several months so that people are not penalised for fluctuating incomes”. And crucially, “ending the benefits freeze a year early so that benefits are inflation proofed again, at an estimated annual cost of pound.billion in  ”.  Mr Cable will tell guests: “The overall cost is around poundbillion and we have suggested how this can be funded by ing the corporation tax rate to % and by taxing wealth more fairly. “There is a wide range of revenue possibilitiesthere were the political will to address the problem of funding UC properly.” The switch to UC was plunged into disarray this month after the Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey admitted some families would be worse off. Former PM Gordon Brown labelled it “cruel and shyvindictive”, while fellow former premier Sir John Major warned it could become Theresa May’s Poll Tax.

It is not clear what sub-optimal means in practice, or how long this will last. But what is clear is that businesses and iniduals who are reliant on the border running smoothly will pay the price. In a wide-ranging report, the watchdog found political uncertainty and delays in negotiations have hampered the effectiveness of departments border planning and delivery. It said many of the changes needed under a no deal scenario may not be ready for when the UK formally departs the EU on March . In particular, the NAO detailed how: out of  major projects to replace or change key border systems were, as of last month, assessed as being at risk of not being delivered on time and to acceptable quality New infrastructure to track and physically examine goods cannot be built before March Additional resources required to operate the border may not be readyBorder Force intends to recruit  additional operational staff, and increase numbers over the months following EU exit, the report noted. However, it said the agency acknowledges there is a signicant risk that it will not deploy all the staff it plans to recruit by March , . Signicant issues will need addressing to avoid a long period of sub-optimal border ing following a no-deal departure, according to the assessment. It said: Governments assumption that the risks will not change materially on day one is reasonable in the short-term but organised criminals and others are likely to be quick to exploit any perceived weaknesses or gaps in the enforcement regime. This, combined with the UKs potential loss of access to EU security, law enforcement and criminal justice tools, could create security weaknesses which the Government would need to address urgently.

The new benefit has been unravelled by deep cuts to its funding by the Conservatives combined with their stubborn unwillingness to fix glaring flaws in its design. The result is a slow-motion disaster which risks failing to achieve its goals while needlessly pushing tens of thousands of households into poverty. It doesn’t have to be like this. The Conservatives’ failure to competently implement Universal Credit should not blind us to its inherent merits. The Liberal Democrats supported UC in principle because we believed in its aim of simplying our convoluted welfare system and making work pay for those on benefits.  While the current Government’s handling of UC has left it on le support, Liberal Democrats argue that with a pause followed by some major reforms, the system could yet be salvaged. The first big problem with UC is a lack of money. Though initially designed to be more generous than the system it is replacing, in the  summer Budget the Conservatives cut around poundbillion per year from UC’s funding, making it in effect less generous. Many warned at the time of the impact the cuts would have on the poorest, which are only now beginning to be felt. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation – where I am giving a speech today- they are likely to push around , people into poverty by .  The second problem is a number of major design flaws which the Conservatives are refusing to fix for ideological reasons. The most well-known of these are the long waits - both for first payment and in-between payments - that are pushing many desperate households into indebtedness and food bank dependency. Another is UC’s policy of making claimants responsible for their housing benefit payments, which has led to a spike in rent arrears and a growing unwillingness of landlords to rent to people on UC. The Government argues that these design features will teach people to be responsible with their finances, but instead the Government should take responsibility and end the suffering it is inflicting on society’s most vulnerable.

The Duchess of Cambridge wore a kingfisher blue Alexander McQueen dress for the event in honour of the King and Queen of the Netherlands. Royal fans believe her necklace is from Queen Alexandras Wedding Parure, which was a gt from Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, ahead of their wedding in .

He was nodding away at my answers as he asked about my childhood. Was I often in trouble at school   Yes. Often in detention  Yes. Always being told off  Yes.I was a loud, chattering and annoying schoolboy. In fact, teachers allowed me to stand at my desk during classes because I couldn’t sit still or down for very long.Did I do well at school  No. I only passed four out of nine O’ levels, scraped some re-sits and left before my A’ levels were finished. Walking out after nine years of boarding school and ringing my Dad to say I had also got my girlfriend pregnant , you could hear the screaming from space.Had I been in trouble with the law  Yes. A conviction aged  for siphoning fuel from a car on someone’s driveway. I pleaded guilty and was fined pound from my dole money.  By the time I was  I had two children, had been homeless, mostly unemployed and for my middle-class parents I was a ‘lost soul’. For four years they barely knew where I was. I roamed around the country, in a converted lorry, doing odd-jobs as my family despaired and worried. As an adult, I’d find myself making impulsive decisions, often leading to a complicated personal le. Relationships failed, I have four children from two mothers. Despite the complications, we all get on and I’m very proud of my children even though I’ve often been an absent Dad. I look at friends and family and wonder how their lives can seem so stable and sorted. Why do I never seem able to stick at things and see them through  The doctor told me there may be a reason. A few days after that chat in the surgery I was sitting in a consultant psychiatrists’ office with a ping pong ball strapped to my head. I was told to stare at a screen and click when I saw certain shapes. I thought this was all ridiculous. The doctor had thought I had undiagnosed ADHD. I didn’t know what that meant, and was sceptical. I said to the psychiatrist that all of us forget things or have a limited attention span when faced with something we don’t really want to do. He, of course, defended the work he does telling me it’s not about an inability to focus but an inability to control what you focus on.  That sank in. I thought, yes, I’d often found it dficult to control focus, to think straight. Unless I am really, really interested and then I ‘hyper focus’. As a broadcast news journalist, he said, you’ve ended up doing a job tailor-made for people with ADHD. Always unpredictable, with constant stimulation and once the broadcast is over the team moves on to the next issue or breaking development. You’re never sitting still for long in a newsroom. I started the test, my legs soon jigging up and down, feet tapping on the floor. My head was twitching, and I was biting my lips with the effort to stay still and focus on this boring test for  minutes. The ping-pong ball on my head was measuring my head movements. After what felt like a couple of days, I was shown a messy scribble on the screen which had been traced by the headgear, and just how twitchy I’d been. Now I was told to take one tablet of Concerta, another brand name for the same drug as Ritalin. The tablet contains methylphenidate, a stimulant that can increase focus. “The drug takes half an hour to start working and so come back in an hour and a half and we’ll do the test again” I was told. A couple of hours later I started the test again. This time my legs and feet didn’t move at all. I stayed still. It was a strange feeling. This was the moment that, as the drugs worked, the penny dropped. I could be dferent, and I could focus, and I could stay still. The results showed a much neater pattern measured by the headgear. I was shown broken-down results which suggested in some areas of concentration the increase was % with the drug.  There was a sense of relief. For the first time in my le at the age of  I felt I had answers. Mainly to those around me, my nearest and dearest who’d always just said that’s “what I’m like”. Michelle Beckett, the founder of ADHD Action, a campaigning charity which tries to highlight the need for better diagnosis of ADHD says: “Almost every late diagnosed adult we speak to describes overwhelming relief at being given an ‘explanation’ for their challenges. This is coupled with an almost instant easing of the deep shame and guilt felt for ‘not living up to their potential’ or other ‘failures’ throughout le. Often these feelings of self-blame have lasted for decades.” That sense of grief then began, for the so-called ‘lost years’. Whatthis had been identied when I was at school  I could have developed strategies to compensate, known the dangers to my behaviour and take the medication that I do now. But it’s too late for all that. We can’t live in the past. I’m so grateful to the doctor for picking up on a few clues in a conversation. To the psychiatrist. To my partner Chrissie whose patience and understanding means so much. During Mental Health Awareness Week this year I tweeted that’d I’d been diagnosed. The stigma attached to ADHD, or any mental condition, meant I was wary of telling people at work but the response from colleagues at ITV News was overwhelming.  I tweeted as I was sitting on a train heading into work at Westminster and I was so moved by the supportive replies that I put my sunglasses on to hide my tears as I sat in a crowded carriage. Michelle Beckett replied to my tweet as did Tony Lloyd, CEO of the ADHD Foundation. I spoke to them both shortly afterwards and they were both so helpful with explaining how many people deal with diagnosis and coming to terms with dealing with the condition. There are so many misconceptions about ADHD. It’s often thought it only affects children. That it’s to do with bad parenting or other disorders. In fact, having ADHD often leads to depression or anxiety disorders. That’s also been the case for me and I’ve had excellent help from the NHS at times in my le. Men are three times as likely to be diagnosed as women and black boys presenting with symptoms of ADHD are often written off as ‘bad’, lazy or just rude. Adults with ADHD are nine times as likely to end up in prison and twice as likely to be fired from a job, according to #attentionuk, an ADHD campaigning group.  The problem for diagnosing ADHD is that firstly there is no biological test and then there are dferent types for example, some people are hyper, and others aren’t. People can spend hours focussing on the things they like, that gives them their dopamine starved brains a good-feeling and spend no time on the things that don’t interest them, like work or personal admin. Neglecting whole areas of your le is a common theme. Michelle says: “Around % of adults with ADHD suffer from mental health problems, and it carries a tenfold risk of suicide. It’s therefore totally unacceptable that so many GPs and mental health professionals refuse to even accept ADHD even exists in adults.” It’s even more shocking there is a postcode lottery of waiting times sometimes several years long, or even no service whatsoever. ADHD is stigmatised, misunderstood, yet highly treatable. If this was any other condition, there would be a public outcry. My le is now better and I now have the tools to try to limit the impact of ADHD, not just on me, but on those around me.Angus Walker is a Correspondent for ITV News.

Jacob, who is currently being tested for autism and ADHD and is on the special education needs register, was told he had fibbed when he announced he had thrown a ball in the target at a concession stand, his dad says.Furious Richard Johnson, , told KentLive: At about pm we said: Right last couple of rides, weve got to go home. We had been putting off going to the concessions stand as the odds are always against you.We go over to the first one and have the rules explained to us. The man gives my son three balls that you have to throw against the backboard and land in a designated area. He then goes to serve someone . My sons first shot lands in the area and then the man goes no you didnt do it right, it just went straight into the bucket. He gets all sarcastic going what you have got to do is this and calls Jacob a liar and a cheat. I go hang on a minute, hes eight-years-old, you dont call him that.  Jacobs mum, Caroline, , was horried to see her son upset after the man mocked him so she challenged the employee. Richard said: He said youre lying and that really got my wes back up and she said we are not liars. The attendant finally gave my son the prize and said wellyou can sleep at night knowing you have lied at which point my we replied we are not liars and he replied no not you, them and pointed to my son and myself. Deciding to set a good example to his children rather than getting angry, Richard went to customer services. He was told they would need to investigate the sitaution. Shockingly, he had to wait almost three weeks for an apology and he is still unsatisfied by what he calls a generic fob off email that he had to chase them for with persistent phone calls. He continued: I made a phone call and spent  minutes on hold to be told I needed to give it  working days and should hear back by October  but it takes a bit longer as the concession stands are third party employment. I said I dont care, hes wearing Legoland unorm on your property.  The trip had originally been a surprise for Jacob and his sister, Jessica, six, but the parents refuse to go back after their experience. He finally received a phonecall from their complaints department, and as an apology, they said that Jacob could choose any pack of Lego up to the value of pound - but Richard still says he wont take his family there again. He said: If I didnt go to all this trouble, I wouldnt have got anything. Legoland used to be a magical place but my son doesnt see it like that anymore. No amount of Lego bricks is going to change that. I dont want to go back. I want an apology for my son. I try to teach my son right from wrong but theyre not going to do anything about that guy. I feel genuinely sorry for the people who work in customer services there as theyre not training their people there or in the park properly. The lady admitted there was a failing in their training as this shouldnt be happening.  If they had turned around on the day and gave him a pound toy to say sorry we would have had none of this. Its been blown out of proportion because of their lack of customer service. A spokesman for Legoland Windsor resort said: We are very saddened to hear of Mr Johnson and his family’s experience at the resort, and apologise that on this occasion the high standard of customer service we expect from all of our staff was not met.

Addressing the audience with a traditional greeting of “Bula!” she told how it was “a great privilege” to be on the island. In her impassioned speech, Meghan said: “As a university graduate, I know the personal feeling of pride and excitement that comes with attending university.  “From the moment you receive your acceptance letter, to the exams you spend countless late nights studying for, the lelong friendships you make with your fellow alumni, and the moment you receive your diploma. “The journey of higher education is an incredible, impactful and pivotal one.” Meghan has previously been an advocate for women in her role for UN Women, the Duchess said the right to receive education is vital “for women and girls in developing countries”. She said: “I am also fully aware of the challenges of being able to afford this level of schooling for many people around the world – myself included. It was through scholarships, financial aid programmes and work-study where my earnings from a job on campus went directly towards my tuition - that I was able to attend university.  “And, without question, it was worth every effort. “Everyone should be afforded the opportunity to receive the education they want, but more importantly the education they have the right to receive.

I am pleased to announce today that two new grants will be awarded to Fiji National University and the University of the South Pacic, allowing each of them to run workshops which empower their female staff. “This means that female faculty members are able to encourage others to follow in their footsteps and enter higher-education, and that more women become part of the decision-making process in academic institutions. Grants like this ensure that women are provided with the training and skills to operate effectively in their roles, and those with leadership potential are given the opportunity to be heard and recognised at the most senior level. “It is wonderful to join you here today and we look forward to learning more about your academic endeavours, and the work you plan to do as future leaders and as change-makers! “My husband Harry and I, wish you all the very best of luck as you continue your studies and work.

The Dailylost the latest round of a free speech fight with the company boss accused of discreditable conduct. Three Court of Appeal judges barred the newspaper from publishing confidential information after analysing rival arguments at a hearing in London. But one MP has vowed to help fight the gagging order. Jess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, urged victims to contact her, adding that she was done with these rich men using our laws to hide you away. Under Parliamentary privilege, Phillips would have legal immunity against civil or criminal liability for actions done or statements made in the course of their legislative duties - for example, naming the businessman in the House of Commons.  The unnamed businessman, a senior executive in a company group, plus managers at two companies in the group, took legal action in a bid to stop thepublishing a story. A High Court judge had, in August, refused to gag the newspaper. But the executive and managers at the two companies mounted a challenge and three appeal judges have overturned Mr Justice Haddon-Caves decision. Sir Terence Etherton, Lord Justice Underhill and Lord Justice Henderson have outlined their decision in a ruling. They said five employees of companies in the group had made allegations of discreditable conduct by the executive. In all five cases complaints had been compromised by settlement agreements under which substantial payments were made to the employees who had complained. Both sides had undertaken to keep confidential the subject matter of complaints. The three judges had overseen a Court of Appeal hearing in September and published a ruling on Tuesday. The three appeal judges have not named anyone involved, apart from the newspaper. They named the claimant executive and companies as ABC  others.

Her Majesty told the King of the Netherlands that as we look toward a new partnership with Europe the values shared by the UK and Holland are our greatest assets. Speaking at a state banquet in honour of King Willem-Alexander and his we Queen Maxima, the Queen added that as innovators, traders and internationalists we look with confidence to the future. The Queen, who remains impartial in political matters, chose to emphasise the qualities needed by the UK and one of its closet European neighbours going forward as UK politics continued to be deeply ided by the issue of Brexit.  Earlier, in a speech to both Houses of Parliament, King Willem-Alexander urged the UK Government to lt the shadow of uncertainty hanging over Dutch nationals living in Britain after Brexit. And in his address at the Buckingham Palace dinner, with Theresa May seated nearby, the foreign head of state said: At present, a lot of attention is focused on the technical side of Brexit. Thats understandable and necessary. But in the midst of all that complexity we should not lose sight of the greater narrative that continues to bind us.  The greater narrative of freedom, openness and cooperation. Of growth and a prosperity whose fruits are enjoyed by all. In contrast to the speeches, the royal women, who included Queen Maxima, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Cornwall, put on a dazzling display of royal tiaras during the white-tie dinner. Kate Middleton wore a blue gown by Alexander McQueen and Princess Dianas Cambridge Lover’s Knot tiara.  Queen Maxima of the Netherlands outblinged all the guests by wearing the incredible diamond Stuart tiara. The Queen told Hollands head of state during her speech: I recall the state visit of your grandmother Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard in , when I spoke of how our nations close understanding and relationship would become increasingly important as a new configuration of Europe was emerging. As we look toward a new partnership with Europe, it is our shared values and commitment to each other, that are out greatest asset, and demonstrate that even through change, our enduring alliance remains strong, and as innovators, traders and internationalists we look with confidence to the future.  In her speech, the Queen praised the close links between the UK and Holland which greatly contributes to the economic and cultural le of Britain. She added: The Netherlands are one of the United Kingdoms largest European investors. We have a thriving Dutch community, and artistic and sporting exchanges are at an all-time high. Willem-Alexander reiterated comments made before about regretting the UKs decision to leave the EU, but he respected the decision of the British people. He went on to personally praise the Queen, highlighting her now famous appearance in the London  Olympics opening ceremony, describing her as the most fearless Bond Girl ever for her role alongside  played by Daniel Craig. The foreign monarch said: In recent decades, you have seen your country, Europe and the world change enormously. The world looks to you as a trusted beacon in the midst of upheaval. Your ability to keep in touch with the times is striking. You even have an adventurous streak, as you showed six years ago at the opening of the Olympic Games.

Iain Mitchell, his we Audrey and their son Innes were flying back from Florida when to their horror a window shattered and the plane began to rapidly decend. The Boeing , due to land in Iceland, started to drop over Canada, causing panic to spread throughout the cabin.Iain, , told the Daily Record : “We were flying home from Orlando to Iceland, then onwards to Glasgow.“I had just taken some medication and said to my we that I was probably going to fall asleep as I had to drive to Castle Douglas to pick up our dogs when we got home. “The next thing I know I was wakened from my sleep by Audrey punching me in the side saying, ‘something is happening’. “The air hostess then said, ‘tables up, tables up we are going to have to land’.  Terried, Innes, , was so scared that he asked his dadthey were going to survive the journey. He said: No-one knew what was happening but Audrey said the plane was going down and the turbulence was pretty bad you could see the nose of the plane was pointing downwards. We dropped , feet in less than  minutes and my son turned to me and asked, ‘are we going to die ’ “I said no and tried to reassure him, then the captain announced that ‘all systems were go’ but we had to land. “It wasn’t your normal smooth landing it was all a bit rocky and you could see lots of emergency vehicles on the runway. “We were all very shaken up and were sat on the tarmac waiting to get off the plane when the captain announced a window had shattered in the cockpit.” The Icelandair plane carrying the stunned Mitchell family and the other  passengers and seven crew members emergency landed in Bagotville, km north of Quebec City. Iain said: “We didn’t know where we were all we knew was that it was Canada.  “One of the passengers said she worked for Icelandair and became the spokeswoman for the airline. She told passengers they were being taken to local hotels and we stood in line waiting for buses. “We were quite lucky as a lot of other families were split into dferent rooms but we got one together. The hotel actually ran out of food as it obviously wasn’t expecting as many guests to arrive all at once. “We spent the night in the hotel and the next day we were sat on couches in the lobby when we were interviewed by journalists. “We then got the call at about .pm to say that another plane had arrived from Iceland to take us there and we got back on the bus to the airport. When we got there you could see the plane we landed in was still on the runway and it made us realise how lucky we all were.”  Iain, Audrey and Innes arrived back at Glasgow Airport on Sunday morning –  hours later than scheduled – and though now safely back home on Carnbroe soil, are still “shattered and exhausted” by their terrying experience. “We’re all pretty exhausted and just so glad to be home safe and sound. “We haven’t heard from Icelandair since the incident happened, but another passenger on the plane, who said he was with the airline, told us the cockpit window hadn’t been hit by anything and it had been a technical issue. “He added that it had been a cm crack that started to spider.” The Mitchell family holiday in Orlando every year and have mixed views on whether their frightening flight would put them off future air travel. Iain said: “Audrey is saying she doesn’t think she could fly again, but I’ve already been on the phone booking the villa for Orlando next year! “I think we will all be back on a plane again it’s just the horrendous shock we’ve all been through is still very raw.” An Icelandair statement read: “The aircraft was on route over Canada when pilots noticed a crack in one of the cockpit windows.

Abbie Watson, , was left unable to look at her reflection for months after a woman smashed a wine glass in her face. The carer and her boyfriend James Glasby, , were on a night out when trainee beautician Demi Marshall glassed her, leaving her in a pool of blood and causing her to pass out.Mr Glasby lost his wallet while they were out in the pub in February and they asked Marshallshe had seen it, reports WalesOnline .But Marshall, , saw red and smashed a glass with some force into Abbies face, before thrusting it into her cheek and dragging it down.  Abbie said: Her reaction was explosive. She was screaming at me and just lost it. I turned around to confront her but in that same moment she lunged at me and jabbed at my face with a smashed wine glass. She had whacked her glass on the bar to break it and in a split second had thrust it into my cheek and dragged it down. I was freezing, everyone in the pub was piling their coats on me as I waited for an ambulance. My boyfriend was distraught, he was trying to tell me it would be okay but I could see how scared he was.  When my mum saw my face she just screamed. Ill never forget it. While in hospital, Abbie needed two blood transfusions and an operation to close the wound in her face. In total, she had  stitches and has been left with zig-zag scars across her face. Abbie was left with facial injuries, including a wound by her eye and a fractured cheek bone. Marshall was later jailed for six years in September for the incident, which lasted between  seconds and a minute.In a victim impact statement read out at Cardf Crown Court, Abbie said: This incident has ruined my le. Abbie said at the time of the sentencing that she had not been able to look at her reflection for months, and had to take down all the mirrors in the house because I found it too upsetting.

Im  and Im on anti-depressants, Im too scared to go out alone, I dont want to go back to work yet. It feels like my le is over.  Sentencing Marshall in September, Recorder David Elias QC said: What you did caused terrible facial injuries. Being scarred at all is bad enough, but being scarred in that way to the face means there is a constant reminder of what happened. Causing these sorts of injuries, with these consequences, must be met with the proper sentence.” He found her intention was formed on the spur of the moment.

he was shocked by Neil McCann’s departure as Dundee boss but says they must move on under new man Jim McIntyre.Boyle was one of the last signings McCann made for the Dark Blues at the end of the summer transfer window and he has made a good impact, so far, scoring in the - win at Hamilton – Dundee’s only league win of the season.And the Irish centre-back insists he wants to maintain those good displays under Macca as they look to rise from the foot of the table, starting at Livingston today.“With the new manager coming in it’s been quite positive and bubbly,” the -year-old said.“We had a quick chat with what the manager expects of us and what way he wants us to play.“We’ve had some good training sessions, full of energy and enjoyable.“As professional footballers we have to be ready for all kinds of situations and, either way, we knew we were going to be in on Wednesday morning and had games to prepare for.“From Tuesday when Neil McCann left there was no real indication the turnaround was going to be so quick but it was training as normal.“With the international break over the past week it was a bit of a surprise on Tuesday when the news broke but it’s just one of those things.“Neil was great at the time when he was here, in the short time I got to work with him.“We need to move on now, though, because we’ve got big games coming up over the next few days.”Newly-promoted Livi are flying high under manager Gary Holt and sit in fth place in the Premiership table on  points,  ahead of the Dark Blues.Their former-player manager Kenny Miller is now on the books of Dundee and Boyle admits the players have been using the hitman’s experience ahead of a game he feels they need to get a result from.He added: “Lads will probably speak to Kenny and ask him about what they’ll face in their dferent positions.“Since I’ve been here Kenny’s been brilliant, he knows the game very well and has a huge pedigree in the game so he’s a big help.“Livingston have the articial pitch and that will be dficult compared to what we’re used to but we showed against Hamilton that we can play on that.“We know it’ll be a test for us because, obviously, they have gone so well at the start of the season.“It’s a game we believe we can get a positive result from.”And the Dee will be hoping they can pick up some points as it doesn’t get any easier with current league leaders Hearts coming to Dens Park on Tuesday night.Although they’ve not had much of a chance to train as a group under Jim and have been out of the swing of regular matches because of the international break, Boyle feels they’ll be ready for the challenge of playing two games in four days.Boyle said: “As players you want to play as many games as possible.“You’d rather play games than train and the Saturday-Tuesday is a chance to get maximum points on the board and that’s the way we’ve got to look at it now.“It’s important now to get results and try to climb the table.“We’ve picked up of late and we have the confidence going into today that we’re more than capable of getting a result.“We’ll, hopefully, take that into Tuesday but today’s game is first and foremost.“It’s a massive game for us.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/frost-and-snow.jpg ","title":"new home sought for very intelligent chicken trio","story":"A new home is

substation and build 12 flats","story":"Energy giant SSE is hoping to scrap one of its Dundee substations and replace it with  new flats.The power firm has submitted an application to Dundee City Council to build the four-storey block in Stobswell.The Buchanan Street plot is currently home to the former substation building and several steel storage containers which have been left to rust for several years.The new building could accommodate up to  two-bed flats along with car parking spaces and an access road which loops around the completed complex.The flats would be socially let, according to documents included with the planning application.SSE’s proposal is for planning permission “in principle”, meaning bosses at the firm want to seethe idea itself will be approved before investing in more detailed plans.If approved, the firm will have to submit an additional application before being able to push on with any work at the Stobswell site.A report included with SSE’s application, prepared by estate agents Graham + Sibbald, promises improvements to a “derelict and unsightly” area should the plan be given the thumbs-up by council planning officers.It said: “The application site is in a location where residential use is already established and the proposed development is in-keeping with the character of the area.“The proposed development will result in a signicant improvement to the site, which currently contains a disused sub-station building and steel storage containers, and is unmaintained and overgrown.”Colin Clement of Stobswell Forum said it was “great news” for the area. He added: “That area needs regeneration – that street has been left like that for decades. We’d be very supportive of that.”SSE believes the flats would suit the area due to its strong transport links, with frequent buses into the city centre available from Dura Street.Dundee City Council is now considering the proposal with a decision expected to be made by the end of next month.If it is approved, SSE would likely submit more detailed proposals some time next year."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bcedfd19aee3.jpg ","title":"were ready dundee council has gritting and ploughing vehicles at the ready for this weeks cold snap","story":"Taysiders could get their first taste of winter this weekend as colder conditions move in across the region.Temperatures are set to plummet as low as C in coastal areas with snow on the hills and a risk of ice on the roads, according to forecasters.And the mercury could dip below freezing in rural parts.The cold weather will arrive on Friday and last until at least Sunday.It follows a run of milder weather with daytime temperatures regularly reaching the low to mid teens in recent weeks.Bonnie Diamond, a press officer for the Met Office, said: “It will turn colder from Friday as a northerly airflow becomes established across Scotland, with daytime temperatures in Dundee through the weekend of -C.“It’ll be bright with sunny spells at times, but there will be some wintry showers of rain, sleet and hail too, with snow falling over higher ground across the Cairngorms and Highlands.“At night temperatures will fall to about -C, giving frost and a risk of ice.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bus chiefs issue another safety","story":"NewsBus chiefs issue another safety warning on Ayrshire bus routeIt has been reported that children have been “cycling in a dangerous manner” in front of buses travelling through the Patna scheme.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsStagecoach bus route  as it passes through Patna \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBus services through Patna are at risk - for the second time in less than a year.

Bill Logan, who heads Girvan’s Youth Trust, said: “We’re trying to promote ourselves as a tourist town which is open for business. “How can you do that with rats running all over the street and into shops  “I feel for businesses – it’s ridiculous they should have to put up with this.” The long-running decay of the former bingo hall and cinema was highlighted this week when rats were spotted running loose.  A number of shops in Dalrymple Street are being plagued, causing council environmental teams to swoop. Elaine Murdoch, owner of Nanettes baby shop, revealed: “Luckily I haven’t had one in yet –I did I think I’d close. “A rat ran into another shop the other day and the poor woman was hysterical. “This has been a long time coming as the state of the building is a disgrace.” South Ayrshire’s Tory council chief, Martin Dowey, is among those to have witnessed the vermin first hand. He said: “I was delivering leaflets in the town last week and one ran right in front of me. It was half the size of a cat, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. “You have to feel for the businesses and homeowners and hopefully this is rectied as soon as possible.” A council spokesman confirmed a seven-day action order has been placed on the building.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeCommentsShow more commentsMore OnArmed forcesGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13420214.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_asr_ayp_031018gin1.jpg","title":"world wonder through looking glass","story":"NewsWorld of wonder through the looking glass at Hendricks GinIt’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsWhere the magic happens Hendricks Gin Palace \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“A gin made oddly”– put simply by the gin gods themselves – Hendrick’s. It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

This is hard for me as I am disabled and struggle to take it in and out when I use the shower.At my former address the replacement bags were thrown into the garden at collection time.

RoundThe Pupils never really got going in this cup-tie, ending the game as second best to a moderately talented visiting side.Kinross were fortunate to be confronted by a uncharacteristically tame performance from the McFadyen sponsored home favourites.Lacking the key elements of drive, determination and quick controlled possession, the home side, playing with a threadbare squad due to injury and call-offs  used the long ball far too often in the first half.During the first twenty minutes the Pupils had territorial advantage, but were never able to string enough passes together to make a telling impact on the game.With the visitors hardly an attacking force, the home crowd was shocked when Kinross unexpectedly grabbed the lead shortly before half time.It’s ironic given that the Pupils back four seemed to be on top of their game, that one mistake should prove so costly.There seemed little danger, but the ball was lost in a crucial area and turned across goal for the incoming forward to score with the visitor’s only shot of the whole first half.The second half began disastrously for the home side, a through ball exposing the last line of defence whose first real action was to pick the ball out of the net.Given what went before, it was unimaginable that the Pupils were two goals behind at this stage the visitor’s ‘smash and grab’ tactics a complete contradiction to their earlier failure to attack.With the confidence of an unexpected but comfortable two goal cushion, the Fe League side turned the screw by controlling possession from the back.Mistakes had cost the home side dear, and, for the first time in the match the visitors looked like a team heading for the next round of the Scottish Cup!The home side tried desperately to retrieve the situation, but gaps appeared at the back as they threw caution to the wind.The keeper, young Alastair Ferguson, saved the day by fisting clear inside the six yard box, a timely intervention which kept the Pupils in the game at a crucial stage.Almost immediately, the home side were awarded a penalty kick on the back of a wild challenge in the box, and Gary Grumoli drove the ball into the net.Sensing blood, the Pupils powered forward at last using the ball to good effect with some fine possession football.However, it proved a  dawn and only a prequel to another defensive mistake which resulted in the visitor’s restoring their two goal cushion via a poacher’s finish from point blank range.In a breathtaking finish, the Pupils gained a second penalty with minutes remaining however, resisting the urge to change the kicker, Gary Grumoli placed his second effort to the keeper’s opposite side, only to see his kick saved dramatically.It was the final act of an uninspiring, but ultimately exciting game.The Pupils will try to put the cup disappointment behind them when they travel to play old foes, Hillington, in a league fixture tomorrow.Ellis Robertson played a solid game in the centre. _cpupilsvkinrossRyan

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

The use of recycling boxes rather than bins and the introduction of food waste caddies has helped the county produce high-quality waste with fewer contaminants, meaning less has to be sent for treatment.Now Mr Reid wants to bring a similar approach to travel in the county as East Lothian prepares for an influx of new residents due to a plethora of new housing developments.And he revealed talks were under way to try and replace the councilrsquos refuse collection vehicles with electric versions as it looks to lead by example.He said: ldquoThe public bought into recycling because we gave them options such as the food waste bins and also because they knew it was the right thing to do.ldquoActive travel will be an evolution but we need to give people access to it. We need to provide cycle paths and safe walkways we need train services to be on time. If we can develop plans to provide these services then people will automatically select not to take the car, just as they will select electric vehicles as they become cheaper too.ldquoIt is about getting the message out and empowering people to be able to do it.The introduction of electric bin lorries would be a huge step towards improving the environment and changing public perception.Some such lorries are being trialled in England by waste recycling firms, with one company in Sheffield introducing two vehicles which are powered by burning non-recyclable rubbish as they collect it. Others are being tested using rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe are actively working with partners to deliver one of the first fully electric refuse collection vehicles that would be powered through renewable energy currently generated on site at Kinwegar [recycling centre near Wallyford]."},{"url":null,"title":"update-dog-that-bit-off-mans-genitals-put-down","story":"The -year-old man was taken to hospital in Edinburgh following the attack on Sunday, October .The Courier

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did.

The report says their careers are often hindered by sexual harassment, a lack of opportunities for progression, or discrimination related to pregnancy.Meanwhile gender pay gaps show ldquoshocking levels of inequality in how womenrsquos work is valued, the Commission said.Disabled people are twice as likely to be jobless, and are seeing the gulf between their pay and the rest of the workforce grow wider, while ethnic minorities are twice as likely to be unemployed or living in poverty.Young people are most likely to be unemployed and are disproportionately in insecure jobs.Lesley Sawers, Scotland Commissioner for the EHRC, said the review showed limited progress in some areas since the previous review in , but this was slow, and neither consistent nor widespread.She added: \"Despite efforts made by the Scottish Government and many others the same problems which have been highlighted in previous reviews are still apparent.\"The stark reality of inequality in Scotland today is that too often people are unable to realise their full potential, are excluded from positions of influence, and experience prejudice and discrimination in daily le.\"The report draws on public data to assess what progress is being made in a range of areas.In the workplace, it warns women, disabled people, young people and ethnic minorities are still not being treated fairly. As well as being more likely to be out of work, women are more likely to be in part time work.Just days after local authority care workers in Glasgow go on strike over the failure to resolve their equal pay claims, the EHRC report will warn that the gender pay gap has changed very little in recent years.Women continue to be under-represented in the senior ranks of many workplaces, even in education, health and other areas where they account for the majority of the workforce, it says.The commission claims such discrimination has a direct impact on levels of poverty, which is getting worse on nearly all measures.The majority of children living in poverty are now from working households, it points out , while women and disabled people are most at risk from the worst poverty.People with mental health problems and people from ethnic minority backgrounds are also more likely to be poor.The report says the UK Government should take much of the blame for the poverty which \"blights the lives\" of too many Scots. \"Unfairness is hardwired into the UK Government tax and spend policies, with some groups ndash black women, Bangladeshis and disabled people ndash suffering disproportionately,\" it says.On sexual harassment, the report claims says a lack of research means we dont know how many people have been sexually harassed in Scottish workplaces, but ious surveys suggest anything between one in three and one in ten workers have experienced sexual harassment, with one study suggesting  per cent of women and six per cent of men believe they have been sexually harassed at work.While nearly all employersclaimed to agree that it was in the interests of their organisation to support pregnant women and those on maternity leave, nearly three-quarters of mothersreported having a negative or possibly discriminatory experience when they were pregnant, on maternity leave, or ing to work from maternity leave.The EHRC says the UK Government should introduce a right for all workers to request flexible working, from the day employment starts, to help reduce the gender pay gap and support more disabled people into work. Currently people who have been employed for less than  weeks have no right to ask to work flexible hours.But it also says Scottish ministers could do more.While praising the Scottish Governments commitment to a fair and inclusive jobs market, and increased government-funding for early learning and childcare, the report concludes more can be done.It calls for the government to require Scottish Councils and other public authorities to publish action plans about how they are monitoring ethnicity and disability, and how they relate to employees chances of being recruited, staying in work and progressing up the career ladder.To tackle workplace harassment, the report says the UK Government should introduce a mandatory duty on employers to take reasonable steps to protect workers from harassment, sexual harassment and victimisation in the workplace and should extend the time limit for bringing cases to employment tribunals for discrimination and harassment to six months.A Scottish Government spokesmansaid:ldquoEquality is at the heart of our vision for a fairer Scotland and despite equalities legislation being largely reserved, we continue to take decisive action on this issue.\"Our Programme for Government makes clear our determination to improve the position of women in the workplace.

In my school, it is fairly common for teachers to be physically assaulted by children whose needs cannot be met due to the inadequate level of funding. The teacher nailed the cause too, blaming a ldquolack of resources and support from government.Inclusion highlights a recurring theme in modern Scottish society: the idea that you can build utopia without hard work thatyou just think good thoughts and say good words, that good things will happen. Utopia, however, costs money.Letrsquos leave utopia aside for a moment, though, and get into the dystopia that is modern schooling in Scotland when it comes to inclusion. One teacher told me that at their school they have not had additional support needs stafffor the last  years. These ASNs are school staff trained to deal with all manner of ldquobarriers to learning ndash whether itrsquos cerebral palsy, dyslexia, or autism.So, as a nation, wersquove decided ndash rightly ndash that all children, no matter what dficulties they face in le, will be educated in a mainstream school. However, we are not paying for the essential staff needed to make the policy work. One cannot say ldquobuild me a house and expect a house to appearno bricklayers are hired.In most schools, support for learning staff ndash what was once called classroom assistants ndash are filling in the aching black hole caused by the lack of ASNs. Classroom assistants, however, are meant to help teachers in all sorts of ways ndashthey are not there just to paper over the cracks in the inclusion policy.Letrsquos take this example of what is happening in schools: therersquos a class with about  pupils ndash itrsquos in a poor inner city area. One child has severe behavioural problems, one child has dyslexia, and one child has minor physical disabilities ndash problems with balance and walking. There are also at least six children in the class for whom English is a second language, including pupils who are refugees and have experienced war. There are eight other classes in the school, with a roll of around  ndash all with pretty much the same makeup. There are four classroom assistants ndash support for learning workers ndash and no ASNs.In this scenario, everyone loses: the majority of pupils have to put up with disruption and are starved of staff time the pupils with special needs, but not behavioural problems, come second in line to those children who are disruptive and the disruptive pupils with behavioural problems are simply managed by untrained staff, not truly helped by those with the skills to better their educational experience. Meanwhile, the staff ndash both teachers and support workers ndash are run ragged by a policy that sounds great on paper for a politician but is hell on earth when put into practice.When asked, most teachers seem to agree that inclusion is good in theory ndash they want schools to be inclusive of all children ndash but it is a disaster in practice because there is not enough money or staff to resource it and make it work. There are therefore only two solutions: abandon the policy, or fund it properly.To abandon the policy would be extremely expensive ndash new specialist schools would need to be built, new specialist staff would need to be trained and hired. Given that many schools have no money for specialist staff, one would imagine that an entire new programme of building specialist schools might also be out of reach. Scrapping the policy would also send out a cruel message: that mainstream schooling is not for those with any form of special needs. No politician would risk that PR disaster.This then leaves us with the only possible solution: fund schools properly. Central and local government need to stop the sleight of hand. You cannot advocate a policy such as inclusion and then not fund or staff it. To preserve the status quo fails pupils, parents and teachers alike, and exposes as phoney the claim that this country really cares about all children and their education."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-tourism-destination-named-as-one-of-the-best-in-the-world","story":"The Highlands and Islands has experienced a surge in visitor numbers in recent years and is now set to welcome even more after being named as one of the worldrsquos best destinations.The area has ranked fth in Lonely Planetrsquos Best in Travel , with the prestigious guide describing it as ldquoone of the wildest, least inhabited and most scenic parts of Europe.However, the further boost to tourism in the region comes amid concerns over how its infrastructure will cope with the increasing numbers.In the last year, concerns have been raised over struggling ferry services and the impact on road networks, as well as the strain on facilities such as parking and public toilets.Local businesses have called for better tourism planning so that visitors enjoy the best possible experience in the Highlands - the only UK destination to make the Lonely Planet top ten.Tom Hall, Lonely Planetrsquos Editorial Director, said: ldquoThe wild landscapes of Scotlandrsquos Highlands and islands offer the ultimate escape and visiting the regionrsquos remote areas is now easier than ever thanks to impressive developments in accommodation.ldquoThis is a stunning area with so much to offer travellers, from its glorious natural landscape and rich history to enviable local food and drink.The Highlands and Islands earned the accolade thanks, in part, to the whisky boom that has seen a swathe of new distilleries open, as well as the impact of popular TV series such as Outlander.Lonely Planet also lists ldquounmissable experiences such as climbing the iconic peak of Suilven and nature watching trips to ldquodiscover the wealth of wildle, from red deer, golden eagles and otters to whales, dolphins and basking sharks among the reasons to visit.The North Coast  route, introduced in , has also lured tens of thousands of extra visitors to the Highlands.Businessman Paul Maden, who owns chocolate factory Cocoa Mountain at Durness in Sutherland, said the listing was \"fantastic\", but warned there is a need to ensure visitor numbers are spread out throughout the year.He said: \"We already get between , and , visitors-a-year. In the main six weeks of the season in July and August it is crazy.ldquoThe challenge for VisitScotland and others is to even out the number of visitors.ldquoThere is the potential for good all year round tourism, but the main season is already incredibly busy. I think the area can take more - but itrsquos a case of when.Concerns after last years peak season prompted the Scottish Government to launch a pound million rural tourism infrastructure fund to help ease the pressure on the region.Photographer Kevin Arrowsmith who lives at Durness said: \"It is ironic that we have talked for so many years about attracting more people to the area and now we have them, but at times too many of them.ldquoPlanned tourism is what is needed. I think an area can attract too many people because the infrastructure cannot support the numbers.Lonely Planet recommends that May and June are ldquoeasily the best months to visit the area due to good weather and the wildflowers on display - as well as to avoid the dreaded midges.It also recommends ldquomonster hunting for Nessie in Loch Ness a day trip to Culloden and exploring the islands of the Outer Hebrides.The Highlands and Islands ranked ahead of the Russian Far East Gujarat, India Manitoba, Canada Normandy, France and Elqui Valley, Chile on the list.Tourism Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: ldquoItrsquos fantastic to see the Highlands and Islands receive recognition for its breath-taking scenery, history and heritage. I am sure the Lonely Planetrsquos support will help to inspire and captivate the imaginations of new visitors.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland Chief Executive, said the recommendation would put the Highlands and Islands ldquoin the global spotlight once again.He said: ldquoI am thrilled, though not entirely surprised, to discover that Scotlandrsquos Highlands and Islands have appeared in this prestigious list.ldquoThis stunning part of Scotland punches well above its weight on the world stage, as a thriving holiday destination for people from both across the globe and the UK, as well as a popular location for film production companies looking for a beautul backdrop for their next blockbuster.He added: ldquoIt is imperative that we donrsquot become complacent, as we need to continue to provide world-class experiences, events and attractions to keep up with the ever-changing visitor demands."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-focusing-on-politics-does-equal-pay-women-no-favours","story":"Take Glasgow: primary schools across the city are currently in shut down while care services are being severely disrupted after thousands of female workers downed tools in protest at the local authorityrsquos apparent lack of progress towards honouring an equal-pay settlement they were promised would be made by the end of this year. Caterers, home carers and cleaners have all walked out for  hours, with , of them taking part in what is being dubbed the largest equal-pay strike ever to take place in the UK.While it is clear that the women have widespread public support, much of the debate around the strike has centred on why their trade unions - the GMB and Unison - have chosen to help them stage their walk-out now. With the first equal-pay claim against the council being lodged  years ago, the suspicion is that the Labour-supporting unions are out to make trouble for the SNP, which has committed to resolving the issue after inheriting it from Labour following last yearrsquos local elections.It is an easy case to make. After all, the unions could have helped organise a walk-out  years ago, when it was clear that a new pay structure adopted by the then Labour-run council valued male-dominated jobs more highly than those done mostly by women. Or at numerous points since, as Labour politicians persisted in mounting what now seems obvious was an unwinnable legal challenge to the councilrsquos equal-pay obligations.Claims from the trade unions, which are by nature deeply political organisations, that there are no politics at play here are a little hard to swallow, especially as one of the GMBrsquos most vocal equal-pay campaigners - regional organiser Rhea Wolfson - is standing as a Labour candidate at the next General Election. The SNP made settling equal pay a key plank of its Glasgow manesto, which helped win Susan Aitken, a self-professed feminist who speaks eloquently about supporting her cityrsquos female workers, her role as council leader. Likewise, helping to organise a strike that will undoubtedly be painted as the ground on which this battle was won, will do Ms Wolfsonrsquos political ambitions no harm.Yet compelling as these arguments are, the problem with focusing on political machinations is that it risks ignoring the real driving force behind the industrial action: the women themselves. For them this strike isnrsquot about scoring political points or furthering political careers, it is about showing that they will no longer take being discriminated against because they are women, regardless of the form that discrimination takes.Indeed, while at its heart this dispute is about the iniquity of supposedly feminine jobs being deemed less valuable than masculine ones, it is also about the lack of options female workers have for staging a protest. While a strike by refuse collectors or gravediggers would be viewed as nothing more than an inconvenience, it has historically been seen as beyond the pale for carers or classroom assistants, whose jobs demand that feminine traits like empathy and compassion be on display at all times, to engage in such actions.Home carer and Unison member Amanda Green spoke movingly on that point yesterday when she told BBC Radio rsquos Womenrsquos Hour programme that the women of Glasgow have been made to feel that because of the type of jobs they do they do not have the right to go on strike. Viewed like that, perhaps the reason the women have not taken action before now has less to do with the unions not wanting to go up against the Labour Party and more to do with the workers themselves feeling duty bound not to walk out on the people they tend to on a daily basis.Now they have taken action, the question is where do things go from here. While the strike has allowed the women to finally take a stand - and has ensured their plight is known well beyond the confines of Glasgow political circles - from the councilrsquos point of view it will not make any dference to the way their settlement is handled. Making the authorityrsquos case on Womenrsquos Hour, Ms Aitken stressed that the action ldquowonrsquot change the outcome of negotiations between the two sides, with the council preparing to pay a fair settlement ldquovery soon.Yet unless all parties can get round the table to have the ldquomeaningful negotiations the womenrsquos representatives have been calling for, that process will stall and the claims - all , of them - will end up back in the Employment Tribunal to be settled on a case-by-case basis. Given theof time that would take to complete, such an outcome can be in nobodyrsquos interests.The strike has allowed both sides to flex their muscles, with the women demonstrating that they are prepared to do whatever is required in order to be treated on a par with their male counterparts and the council showing that it will hold its ground regardless of the cost. Now everyone knows where they stand, is there any reason this matter canrsquot be settled once and for all "},{"url":null,"title":"review-david-byrne-sse-hydro-glasgow-five-stars","story":"David ByrneSSE Hydro, GlasgowKeith Brucefive starsOF COURSE, everyone who had seen this show in the more intimate environment of Glasgow Royal Concert Hall claimed that had been the better night, although it was also telling that a good few had ed to enjoy it again only four months later.And, as far as those of us who were unable to be there in June could tell, this incarnation of David Byrnersquos American Utopia was almost exactly the same, to the extent that its architect felt obliged to point out minor iations from his last visit.

That, along with direct access to a deep-water channel via an -metre long deep-water quayside berth with heavy lt facilities, means the site is ideally placed to help position the Clyde once again as a marine pioneer.As well as construction works, there are plans for the site to become a vibrant base for a wide range of modern marine industries, which could include radar developers and marine technology start-ups, to large scale developers of hydro-electric and renewable energy structures.Malin Group managing director John MacSween said: ldquoThe heritage of the Clyde is something of which we should all be rightly proud.ldquoWe have been working in the shipping industry for over  years and have a passion for the river and its history, but there is a need to be looking to the future to ensure the long-term success of the Clyde as a maritime centre of excellence.ldquoWe want to create a Marine Technology Hub which brings together providers of research, skills development, design, manufacturing and practical marine operational and logistics experience in a location that has complementary facilities backed by direct access to the deep-water channel of the River Clyde.As well as restoring the Clydersquos links with its proud marine heritage, itrsquos hoped the Old Kilpatrick site will help stem a drain of talent that sees Scottish university-educated marine architects and highly-trained marine researchers quit Scotland for overseas roles.Itrsquos also hoped that bringing together marine-based technology and construction companies in one location will creative an innovative spark to help create a new golden age of marine industry on the Clyde.ldquoBusinesses have struggled to find industrial land next to the river to allow them to work on marine-related issues, Mr MacSween added. ldquoItrsquos a sad state of affairs where there was once  miles of quayside along the Clyde, and now itrsquos down to just three or four.ldquoGlasgow has become a cosmopolitan city, with flats and retail parks along the river. But perhaps thatrsquos gone a bit too far, and the city is missing an opportunity to attract some of the marine-based businesses back.He said while BAE Systems and Ferguson Marine are keeping the Clydersquos shipbuilding heritage alive, more needed to be done to nurture marine-based talent.ldquoTraining and ship-management are very well represented and the Department of Naval Architecture at Strathclyde University is a world class centre for research and learning in the marine sector.ldquoWersquore known around the world for producing scientic talent, but most go overseas because they canrsquot find work in their field closer to home.ldquoWersquove been sending a signal that because of a dearth of space we are not open for business, and marine specialists canrsquot come to the Clyde because therersquos no opportunity to set up even though they are right next to the sea.ldquoNow therersquoll be a site that offers just that opportunity.The development, which is in an advanced stage of planning with West Dunbartonshire Council, will see a poundm remediation and regeneration of the contaminated land that is a legacy of the past oil refinery.Preparation works have already uncovered signs of the arearsquos shipbuilding past trenches have revealed an old slipway and signs of a harbour wall which appear to pre-date the oil depot. The structures could be linked to Napier and Miller, based at Old Kilpatrick from , and which built over  ships before falling victim to the Depression.Malin will move its own fabrication company, which currently builds workboats for the aquaculture industry and other marine fabrications at Renfrew, to the site to kick start the development.The construction phase of the project will see over  additional short-term jobs created, while itrsquos hoped that eventually the marine incubator could create  jobs and contribute pound.m annually to the local economy.Mark Newlands, Regional Head of Partnerships at Scottish Enterprise, said: \"We welcome Malinrsquos ambitious plans to revitalise this site and create much needed jobs in the West Dunbartonshire area. We look forward to working alongside the company to support its growth aspirations.ldquoWhat wersquore planning will never be on the same scale as in the past, but therersquos more to marine manufacturing than just shipbuilding, added Mr MacSween.ldquoBut therersquos a lot of exciting technology that needs to be built and sent off around the world.ldquoAnd therersquos potential for Glasgow and the Clyde to once again be at the forefront.ENDS"},{"url":null,"title":"farmer speaks out after bse discovery","story":"The farmer of the herd found with BSE in Aberdeenshire has issued a statement following yesterdays announcement.Thomas Jackson, of Boghead Farm in Lumsden, said: \"This has been a very dficult time for myself and my we and we have found the situation personally devastating.\"We have built up our closed herd over many years and have always taken great pride in doing all the correct things.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time!

The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years. Mr Robertson said: \"We were particularly glad to have a representative of the Inkson family with us, in the form of J.K.rsquos daughter, Helen, and we were pleased to hear a message of greeting from his son, Kerr, who lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\"Kerr wrote of his pride in the job his father had done, developing and managing the exchanges. He also wished us all a happy evening together. We remembered with fondness, all those who were no longer with us, and especially J.K.Inkson himself, to whose memory all drank a fitting toast.\"Warm thanks were also expressed to Sandra Collard who helped maintain contacts and organise the event and Marie-Anny who \"emulated mdash and surpassed mdash her fictional compatriot, Monsieur Poirot, in locating so many of our Belgian friends\".Although Marie-Anny was the only surviving Belgian veteran who felt able to undertake the long journey to Ross-shire, Mr Robertson said: \"There has been a great exchange of email addresses, and it looks like the ether will be buzzing with electronic correspondence between old friends in Britain and Belgium.\"Well done, Marie-Anny and Sandra, for giving us one of the most memorable days of our lives, and thank you Alistair, for your magical photographic memories of this wonderful occasion!\"Wednesday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue.

Brexit, the sht of power from West to East, and Scotland’s pressing need to secure greater economic growth, all demand fresh ideas.”Dr Thomas Bak, University of Edinburgh’s School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, said: “Language skills are an indispensable part of a erse, open minded and globally successful society and economy.“It is timely, because recent research suggests that learning, knowledge and use of languages can have beneficial effects throughout the whole lespan, including improved attentional skills at any age, slower cognitive ageing, a later onset of dementia and a better cognitive recovery from stroke.He added: “Overcoming the counter-productive distinction between ‘modern’ and ‘community’ languages could not only provide a boost for language learning and teaching, but also contribute to a stronger social cohesion.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4818879.1540317291!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon urged to be true to her word with fracking ban","story":"Ministers have confirmed they are consulting on their #preferred policy position# of fracking being prohibited in Scotland, more than a year after the First Minister said the controversial practice was being banned #end of story#.Energy minister Paul Wheelhouse said responses were now being sought on the issue, with the consultation to last until December .Following this, he said the responses would be analysed and published, with it being anticipated “ministers will inform Parliament of our policy on the development of unconventional oil and gas in Scotland in the first quarter of ”.It comes after a Court of Session ruling in June  which found that as a matter of law, there is no prohibition against fracking in Scotland.That was in contrast to Nicola Sturgeon’s comments in Holyrood in October , after the Scottish Government had stated its moratorium outlawing the practice would be permanently extended.Ms Sturgeon declared at the time: “Fracking is being banned in Scotland, end of story. There will be no fracking in Scotland. I don’t think that position could be any clearer.”Petrochemical giant Ineos mounted a legal challenge to the Scottish Government over its stance, which resulted in the Court of Session ruling that while there had been “ministerial statements to the effect that there is an effective ban”, the Scottish Government had accepted that this “did not accurately reflect the legal position”.Lord Pentland said at the time there was an “emerging and unfinalised planning policy” expressing no support on the part of the Scottish Government for the development or extraction of unconventional oil and gas in Scotland.Environmental campaigners at Friends of the Earth Scotland called on the First Minister to “be true to her word” and implement a legal ban.Head of campaigns Mary Church said: “Despite statements from the First Minister to the effect that fracking is being banned, Ineos’s legal challenge earlier this year exposed the Scottish Government’s current position as having no legal force.“A future minority government could overturn the current policy not to support fracking with the stroke of a pen, and crucially, no recourse to Parliament or the will of the people.“Only a legislative approach can ensure a robust, enforceable ban on fracking.

And, to an extent, they should be. Brexit represents a profound change to le in the UK that may have serious effects on the economy, but also on less tangible things like our sense of identity and place in the world. If we do indeed leave the EU in five months’ time, saying the words “I am British” will mean something dferent to the current definition.But, just as The Scotsman recently called for more reason and less passion in the independence debate, the same should be said – and said repeatedly – about Brexit. A “State of the Economy” report, published today by the Scottish Government’s chief economist Dr Gary Gillespie, provides some important facts and reasoned opinions to help prepare for the future. The good news is that Scotland’s GDP is growing and at the strongest annual rate since . The bad news is that “uncertainty” about the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU may hit investment levels as businesses postpone big decisions. Companies may also start stockpiling goods, creating a boom during this financial year that would be “more than offset” by a post-Brexit slump. It is the kind of measured and practical advice that politicians need to know when making decisions about the preparations necessary to smooth the transition.: Leader comment: Independence debate needs more reason, less passionEveryone knows the name of the report’s author and the analysis can be challenged by anyone who cares to do so. Some may insist this is another example of “Project Fear” and continue to put the case for the benefits of Brexit. Passions may run understandably high. But it is important not use language at odds with peaceful democracy, particularly given the rise of the far-right across the West in recent years. The pro-Brexit MPs quoted anonymously as saying Theresa May should “bring her own noose” to a meeting of backbenchers and talked of the imminent moment “when the kne gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted” – adding “she’ll be dead soon” – perhaps thought they were using metaphors like the “Night of the Long Knives”, used to describe Harold Macmillan’s  reshuffle. But the phrase’s origins are deeply sinister, referring to murders carried out by Hitler to ensure his grip on power in pre-war Germany.

In dferent circumstances, a lot more time and energy could be spent tackling some other big challenges facing the country and the world. Here are a few that might get more attentionit weren’t for the B-word, which will not appear again on this page:Local governmentLocal government is picking up the bill for austerity. The Scottish Government has passed on cuts in its block grant to councils with interest, while in England, the impact has been even greater.Financial pressures that have squeezed services are now being felt in bricks and mortar: a backlog of repairs threatens the People’s Palace and Winter Gardens in Glasgow, while in Edinburgh, the council could close all but two public toilets.Growing social deprivation and falling council tax receipts have led to calls for local authority amalgamations in Glasgow and across Scotland, while in England, one council has gone bust with warnings that more could follow.This should be the level of government closest to the public, where people’s voices are heard on issues affecting their daily lives, big and small: streets, bins, schools and housing.There’s a crisis in local government but the only reform agenda to get any real attention – abolishing the council tax – has stalled. The danger of people feeling their elected officials have nothing to say to them has become clear, and local government should be central. Instead, it’s circling the drain.: Councils in Scotland ‘suffer the brunt’ of austerity cutsYemen Yemen’s bloody civil war has long since become a humanitarian catastrophe. Aid workers say the conflict has broken a taboo set by the - Ethiopian famine, whose images are etched in popular memory. There wasn’t supposed to be another catastrophe on that scale, when nearly half a million people died of hunger, shaming the wealthy countries of the world into action.But the pictures emerging from Yemen are as bad as  years ago. Save the Children believes , children died of hunger last year. UNICEF puts the death rate at  children a day – one every ten minutes.But while the famine in Ethiopia sparked a humanitarian response that became a cultural milestone, there’s no such reaction to the crisis in Yemen. Violence stops journalists from reporting and aid from being landed.A key player in the conflict is Saudi Arabia, which has been accused of numerous violations of international law in its air campaign on behalf of the Yemeni government, including a bomb attack that destroyed a school bus in August, killing  boys and dozens of adults. Despite calls for an arms embargo, the value of UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia actually grew by two thirds in , from £ million to \u2028£. billion.: Joyce McMillan: World is turning blind eye to its biggest catastropheDefenceHMS Queen Elizabeth has been in the news as much as Strictly Come Dancing over the past few weeks, from the arrival of the first F fighter aircraft on the aircraft carrier’s deck to dramatic pictures of its arrival in New York harbour, framed by the Manhattan skyline.The Ministry of Defence will be thrilled at media coverage that distracts from less welcome headlines. Serious problems in defence procurement and recruitment threaten to undermine the UK’s military capabilities.The National Audit Office revealed earlier this year that the black hole in the budget for new military kit could exceed £bn. And despite plans to shrink the army to , full-time troops, the outsourcing company hired to manage a recruitment drive hasn’t hit its target since . Army chiefs are now short by , soldiers, and Capita could be sacked from the contract.Meanwhile, even as the UK parades its new aircraft carriers and commits to a generation of shipbuilding work on the Clyde, it could still have fewer than  frigates and destroyers by the end of the next decade, raising questions about whether the Royal Navy can assemble a task force to protect Queen Elizabeth in hostile waters without the help of allies. The UK’s six new Type  destroyers are spending less and less time at sea due to manpower issues and expensive refits to correct engine faults.Again, the Ministry of Defence will point to good news on shipbuilding, with the export of the Type  frigate design – but the fact that Canada is buying  vessels and Australia nine merely underlines how stretched the Royal Navy, which will get just eight, really is.: Almost , Scottish MoD jobs have goneTaxationEarlier this month, it emerged that Facebook paid just £.m in UK corporation tax last year despite making record sales worth £.bn in this country.

The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.I also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last  years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.Some parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability..."},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"Marc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Wednesday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Mr Garman said: \"I have been to hundreds of Highland games fields and the only thing I have always found is the spectators can not get high enough to see what is going on and also get good pictures.\"We will be staging demonstrations as many times as we possible can.

It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron. Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service. We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry. That would alleviate the ridiculous waiting times that passengers travelling by road are experiencing.”“The current way of working has caused no end of problems. We have kids being stranded on buses for hours and cues over  cars deep in both directions. To be fair the council at least seem willing to listen. We now need to get all parties round the table and hammer out a plan on this as quickly as possible, the current situation cannot continue.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/p1-2423-cropped.jpg","title":"raasay shop offers delivery service amid stormy","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA local store on Raasay is offering to deliver essentials to those who can#t access the shop due to weather conditions on the island.Following the . am crossing to Sconser on Friday morning , CalMac announced that it had suspended all sailings between Raasay and Skye due to the conditions.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral.

This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them.

However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27489  ","story":" Michael McMonagleThirty years ago today the British government, fearful of the growth of Sinn Féin, introduced the broadcasting ban to stop Sinn Féin representatives being heard on television and radio. The ban was introduced by the British governments Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd on October , . The ban was brought in an attempt to halt the growth of Sinn Féin in the north and to prevent a wider audience hearing a republican analysis of the ongoing conflict at the time. It prevented Sinn Féin representatives from appearing on television and radio interviews. When it was first introduced many broadcasters were unsure of how it should be implemented and effectively blocked all republicans from the broadcast media, even those who were not members of Sinn Féin. Broadcasters and journalists unions disliked the ban because of the disruption it caused and some sought ways to get around it, the most well known being the actors voice compromise where actors were brought in to speak the words of Sinn Féin representatives. This led to the bizarre situation where viewers could see Sinn Féin representatives on their screens but could not hear their voices. Several actors who went on to have successful stage and screen careers started out by providing the voices for Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and others. Of course, this was not the first time Sinn Féin representatives had been banned from the airwaves the Irish government used a similar tactic  years earlier. Section  of the Broadcasting Act, introduced in , banned Sinn Féin representatives from the media.

However, there is also some natural subsidence that also needs to be addressed.Councillor Gaston wishes to give some reassurance to the public about the current safety of the footpath and boundary wall.He said: “The Department have said the wall is in no immediate danger of collapsing, but obviously there is a danger of this in the future, so I am eagerly and actively pushing that a solution be reached, before the problem gets any worse.” Many residents have expressed a fear thatthe situation persists, the road may have to be closed indefinitely, which is something Councillor Gaston is also keen to avoid. “There is a fear that part of the road might actually come away, so I am urging officials to act quickly to get a plan in place and be proactive about a solution so as work can be carried out in a controlled way, and the road will only have to be closed for necessary work, not indefinitely.”No plan for the road has been made to date, however officials are currently assessing the wall, footpath and road, and work on devising a plan is underway.

Frank’s story is one of a number which has been put together for the release of a tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends of Thomas and Gerard which is to be launched this weekend in Sailortown.Frank, who is now -years-old worked for Casey’s for over twenty years, recalls that day when fate determined who was in the yard that morning when the gunmen arrived.“My main job in Casey’s was to drive the old Bedford TK lorry, making deliveries to pubs, clubs and off licences. I always had one of the young lads on board as a helper,” explained Frank.“Every Wednesday for thirteen years I delivered to Casey’s off licences in Derry and Coleraine. They would ring in their orders on Monday. We would load up the old reliable Bedford on Tuesday and drive up to them on Wednesday morning.“On the day of the shooting that routine was changed which was fortunate for me and whoever was to go with me in the lorry that day. “The off licence in Derry, was due to be sold that Wednesday. If the sale went through, it meant that we would not be delivering to Derry, only Coleraine.It wasn’t until mid-afternoon that word came through that the sale went ahead. Frances Donnelly asked meI wanted to go on up to Coleraine that afternoon. As it was getting a bit late, I knew that we would not get back to the yard until after seven, so I told her that Thursday would be better. Frances gave me a choice that day and the choice that I made, saved my le.“On the Thursday morning we done a bit of tidying up around the yard and got ready to leave with the drink order.I didn’t know who was coming with me, it could have been any of the three lads, Thomas, another lad called Paul McDonald, and of course Gerard .“The owner, Sam Casey needed some pallets fixed, so that meant that Thomas was not going to go with me, because he was the best man for repairing pallets. That left two of lads to pick from, Paul and Gerard.“For some reason none of them wanted to go out that day and to settle matters Paul tossed a coin to see who had first choice, Gerard won the toss and he chose to stay in the yard. “It wasn’t really a big deal for Paul, he went into the store, got his jacket and that was us, we got into the lorry and left the yard, heading for Coleraine.”Frank and Paul headed off for Coleraine but little did they know what was to happen back in Belfast.“We found out later that we had only left the yard shortly before the gunmen arrived. For me, it was just another normal day. We were oblivious to the fact that while we were happily cruising along the motorway that gunmen had slaughtered our work colleagues and friends, back in Casey’s.“About an hour and a half after leaving Belfast I went into the off licence to speak to the manager. I took a phone call – ‘Frank, they are all dead’. I didn’t catch on what he meant, but it soon became clear and he asked who was with me. I told him that Paul was with me. “That confirmed to Vincent  that it was Thomas and Gerard who had been shot. Vincent was married to Marie, one of Sam Casey’s daughters, who worked in the upstairs office along with her sister Frances. Vincent happened to go in to the yard, unaware of what had happened, he saw one of his workers lying dead and when he went upstairs to the office he was met with an absolute blood bath. His we and her sister had been brutally murdered. “I drove back to Belfast in the lorry along with Paul, but I have absolutely no memory of the journey or the conversation between us, but I do remember going to the yard and getting the gates opened so I could drive the lorry in. “When I got into the yard there was blood everywhere, even on the fork lt. There was no one about, but I had no sooner got the lorry parked up, when newspaper reporters started to arrive outside, looking for interviews.“Thomas was seriously wounded and after treatment in hospital, was released after about two weeks. I know that Sam Casey was elated at the fact that Thomas had survived and was on the mend. Sam’s elation soon turned to deep sadness, Thomas died from his wounds exactly three weeks after he was shot.“The gunmen who went into the yard that day and shot my friends down like dogs have to bear the absolute responsibility, but fate played a role, as to who was in the yard when the murderers arrived.“The destiny of at least nine people was decided that day. The survival of the workers who would normally have been in the yard every single Thursday and the slaughter of those who happened to be there, was a matter of “s and buts” and for Gerard it was the outcome of a simple toss of a coin. “Yes, the outcome of the toss of a coin sealed Gerard’s fate, but saved the le of another worker. For Thomas, it was his skills at repairing wooden pallets that meant that he was working in the yard that morning.“I also think of the salesman who had been in the yard on business that morning and left just as we were driving out the gate. “Sam Casey, whose two daughters were murdered, would also have been in the yard that morning had he not have been in the Mater Hospital where he was recovering from a minor operation.”The tribute book will be launched this Sundayin the Mission to Seafarers Centre in Sailortown, soon after a plaque unveiling at pm at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new deacon gregory tells of his hopes for the job","story":"ONE of the nine men ordained as a Permanent Deacon at St Peter’s Cathedral last Sunday says he and others are “not afraid to see the pain” of parishioners as they begin their ministry across the city.Andersonstown man Gregory McGuigan QC spoke of how he will be beginning a new chaplaincy to the homeless after spending close to  years working with those on our streets at the Welcome Organisation and Morning Star hostel.“Technically I’m with St Brigid’s parish but I attend Clonard very regularly and masses for the homeless in the oratory in the Morning Star every Sunday,” he said. “For the past two years I’ve been doing my pastoral training in St Malachy’s close to the Markets in Alfred Street which is an absolutely fabulous place and reading and learning theology at St Mary’s University College,” he said.“The training to get to Sunday past has been a four year process.”Gregory explained how from a young age he had always been in involved “in service of some kind”.“From junior St Vincent de Paul, working with the homeless, I was one of the first ever volunteers at the Welcome Centre as it was known then in the grounds of St Peter’s. Myself and other volunteers would prepare Sunday dinner, talk to those using the centre, after the centre moved to Divis we still take it in turns to prepare, serve and wash up after Sunday dinner.“I asked the Bishop and he has agreed for me to start a new chaplaincy to the homeless and the idea of that is to find out what the spiritual needs of the homeless are and I really want to take the lead on that. As a deacon we are available to go to wake houses, visit with the sick and assist at the altar.”The -year-old described the ordination ceremony on Sunday as one he “enjoyed every minute of”.“I have a lot of friends who are Presbyterian, Protestants and everyone said how much they enjoyed it too, that they had never seen anything like it in their lives. There were four Bishops there and beautul music from Louis McVeigh, the Cathedral was packed and we had a ball. It lashed all day Saturday and the sun came out on Sunday, it was great after four years to finally get it done.”Gregory – whose first job at  was selling the Andersonstown News around the Norfolk area – said the deacons intend to make a really good dference in their parishes and act “as an extra pair of hands across a iety of ministries”.“In my view, the homeless, the poor, the sick, whether mentally or physically are the aristocracy of the Church and I say that word very deliberately. Pope Francis is saying it all the time now.“We have got to take people seriously when they lose someone, whether they are aged  to  in terms of their grief, give our resources, our time, this is what the Church is for.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailortown tribute","story":"A TRIBUTE afternoon is to take place in Sailortown this weekend to remember two men who died in a UVF sectarian shooting,  years ago.Gerard ‘Coke’ Grogan,  and Thomas ‘Tucker’ Osborne,  were killed in the shooting at their workplace, Casey’s Bottling Plant in Millfield on October , .

It has now emerged that the EU is prepared to offer a UK-wide customs union rather than a so-called backstop limited to Northern Ireland alone.However, the EU will insist a special recognition of the situation on this island will have to be factored into the arrangement. The Irish government says that while a time limit could apply to a backstop in England, Scotland and Wales, it must stay in place for Northern Ireland \"unless and until\" a deal ensuring a soft border is secured. But Mrs Mays official spokesman said: \"The prospect of Northern Ireland being placed in a dferent customs arrangement to the rest of the UK is unacceptable.\" Irish premier Leo Varadkar has said he has \"every confidence\" the UK Government will not want to move away from its commitments to the backstop agreement.Meanwhile, ministers were told the UK could be forced to charter ships to bring in food and other suppliesa no-deal Brexit caused chaos in the English Channel. The Cabinet was briefed on the plans for alternativesnew customs controls in France blocked the Dover-Calais route, the Financial Times reported. The newspaper said Transport Secretary Chris Grayling had discussed the possibility of hiring ships, or securing space in vessels, to bring food, medicines and other supplies in through alternative ports. A Department for Transport spokesman said: \"We remain confident of reaching an agreement with the EU, but it is only sensible for government and industry to prepare for a range of scenarios.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may prepares for showdown with tory mps over brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Union reached .The Prime Minister will meet critics at the backbench  Committee in Parliament just days after one anonymous opponent suggested she should “bring her own noose” to the gathering.The meeting follows fresh revelations about the Government’s plans for a no-deal Brexit, with alternative measures to secure supplies of food and medicines from the continent being investigated in case of chaos on the English Channel crossing.And in developments which will cause further unease among Tory Brexiteers, leaked Cabinet papers obtained by The Times indicated the transition period during which the UK will remain tied to Brussels could turn into a “long-running” arrangement lasting years.The option of extending the transition period has been put forward as a way of resolving the impasse over the Irish frontier by giving extra time to find a mechanism to avoid a hard border.Very pleased to announce that @EdwardLeighMP for #Gainsborough  #Horncastle, has pledged to

that the plan “could, in theory, lead to a long-running IP ”.The arrangement could last for many years on a “rolling” basis with an annual decision on whether to extend the period.Responding to the leak, a Downing Street spokesman said: “This is nothing more than a partial reflection of advice to ministers, and not of decisions taken – the Prime Minister made her position absolutely clear in the House of Commons on Monday.“As the PM said then, we do not believe any extension to the implementation period will be necessary, and in any event we would have to be out of it well before the end of the Parliament.“We would not accept a position in which the UK, having negotiated in good faith an agreement which prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland, nonetheless finds itself indefinitely locked into an alternative, inferior arrangement against our will.”Confirmation of Mrs May’s attendance at the  Committee comes amid speculation that the number of Conservative MPs submitting letters calling for her removal is approaching the  needed to trigger a no confidence vote in her leadership.The scale of opposition her Brexit plans face was made clear as the Stand Up  Brexit campaign, which has received high-profile support from former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, said Sir Edward Leigh had become its th backer.Meanwhile, the Government’s contingency preparations for a no-deal Brexit were mocked following reports that ships may have to be chartered by Whitehall to ensure vital supplies reach the UK.The Financial Times said Transport Secretary Chris Grayling had discussed the possibility of hiring entire vessels, or securing space in ships, to bring food, medicines and other supplies in through alternative ports.A Department for Transport spokesman said: “We remain confident of reaching an agreement with the EU, but it is only sensible for government and industry to prepare for a range of scenarios.“We are continuing to work closely with partners on contingency plans to ensure that trade can continue to move as freely as possible between the UK and Europe.”But pro-EU Labour MP David Lammy said: “Brexit has become like a declaration of war on ourselves.“Emergency ships will be chartered for food and medicinewe leave the EU with no deal.“But at least when we’re using ration books and running out of drugs, we’ll have taken back control.”"},{"url":null,"title":"these puppies are dressing up for halloween but theyre not at all scary","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

She questioned why it had been considered racist when a character on The Real Housewives Of New York darkened her skin for a Diana Ross costume.“I felt like, ‘Who doesn’t love Diana Ross ” she said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  On social media, several critics drew comparisons to Kelly’s insistence while at Fox News Channel that Santa Claus was white. “I was born in the same decade as Megyn Kelly and do not recall blackface being acceptable anywhere, anytime,” tweeted Alex Wagner, of CBS News.In her email, Kelly said that she had never been a “PC” person, “but I understand that we do need to be more sensitive in this day and age. Particularly on race and ethnicity issues which, far from being healed, have been exacerbated in our politics over the past year”.“This is a time for more understanding, love, sensitivity and honour, and I want to be part of that,” she wrote.Kelly’s transition from Fox News to her own am hour as part of the Today show has been anything but smooth, and Tuesday’s incident does not help.She had an edge from the beginning of the offending segment, where she discussed Halloween costumes with a  that included Jenna Bush Hager, Melissa Rivers and Jacob Soboroff.“The costume police are cracking down like never before,” she said, ridiculing a college that suggested wearing a cowboy outfit was inadvisable. She noted that one safe suggestion was to go dressed as a letter of the alphabet, and that she had discussed that with her husband.“I’m going to go as ‘F’ and he’s going to go as ‘U’,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"bishop host derry diocesan mass deceased children young people","story":"Bishop Donal McKeown will celebrate the Derry Diocesan Mass for Deceased Children and Young People, remembering in particular those who have passed away this year, on Sunday, November , at pmDuring this Mass the Diocesan community will gather together to remember, to pray, and to celebrate the le of loved ones. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshA diocesan spokesperson said: \"The death of a loved one is always a dficult experience, but this pain can be even greater when the deceased is an infant, a child, or a young adult. \"The Mass will be an opportunity for families and friends to come together to remember their loved ones and to find strength in being together as a Diocesan Community.\""},{"url":null,"title":"comedian father ted star ardal ohanlon return milennium forum derry tickets go sale thursday","story":"he Millennium Forum has announced that the hugely popular comedian, Ardal O’Hanlon, will make a welcomeon Friday th November .

I applied five times to get a disabled parking space for my husband due to his health dficulties and we couldn’t even get one.“I was sent a letter and they said there was ample parking on Academy Road, they told me that when I was bringing my husband home from hospital appointments that I could park outside and take him into the house, then go find another parking space. “There’s no ample parking, they just didn’t want to do it. I know in my heart of hearts that I should’ve highlighted it at the time.”She continued: “That was the start of my crusade, and I thought how dare they not get me a parking bay. And I’ve told people that outside my house is not a car park.“It has got to the stage now where it’s getting out of hand, people are parking on footpaths and you can’t see when you’re coming out of Northland Way on to Academy Road. \"It’s a wonder there hasn’t been an accident at this stage.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshDorothy said people park their cars and walk to North West Regional College and she knows of residents on Duncreggan Road who experience the same issues with students from Magee University.My suggestion would be to put bollards at the corner of the footpath to stop people parking there which would at least keep those areas clear.“A lot of the students also park behind the fire station, along Northland Way and Northland Crescent. \"The other day I seen cars parked the wrong way in a one-way street, it makes it very hard for other people to get through, they’re being completely inconsiderate of other road users.“It’s making it dficult and dangerous for people and that’s why the community is angry and fed up. We’re sick and tired of it and it’s time we started a petition.”Car parkShe made the point that NWRC and Ulster Universityneed to invest in extra car parking spaces for their students and even suggested that a large car park could be built at the Fort George site to ease parking congestion in the city. Dorothy added that the college and university will say the same thing about advising students to park safely, ‘but they need to come up with solutions.’Residents shouldn’t have to ‘suffer’ because of a lack of foresight and planning from the authorities, Dorothy added.Both NWRC and UU have said they will work with residents to deliver a satisfactory solution to the problem.A spokesperson for North West Regional College commented: “We are aware of the current issues regarding car-parking in this particular area, and it is our intention to continue being part of any discussions which will be aimed at finding a speedy resolution for everyone concerned.”Meanwhile, a Ulster University spokesperson said: “We are working closely with PSNI and the Aberfoyle and Duncreggan Residents Association and have advised all students and staff to park legally and considerately. \"We understand that the PSNI and the Residents Association will also communicate this to the general public who may also park in the area.”"},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth county council says green waste bins could be withdrawn if fly tipping incidents continue","story":"County Cllr Michael Williams with the

The newly-formed Ballynahinch United played in a local summer league which involved teams such as Montalto, Drumaness Mills, Plessey, Saintfield, Magheradroll and another called the Bachelors, who apparently had an Italian playing for them.The club made their competitive debut in Division  of the Newcastle and District League in September  when they travelled to Ballykinlar Army Camp to take on the Light Infantry.This fixture would prove to be quite an ordeal in many ways with the team being beaten - as player and car owner Ted McKibbin had to make double journeys to ferry players to and from Ballykinlar.Not a single league victory was recorded that season, although they won a number of friendly games.Although the   season started more optimistically with a - draw away to Down Olympic, it was a further seven games until they defeated the RAF at Bishopscourt -. During the summer of  the team won all eight games to win the Kilmore and District Summer League.Things improved signicantly in the   season as they were promoted as runners-up in Division  and also won the Enterprise Cup, which was played on a league basis, beating Saintfield AYC ndash in the replay after a - draw in the first match.The Swts were formed for the   season and they played in the Willowfield League recording their first win against Saintfield United on October , .Having been promoted to Division  of the Newcastle  District League, they won it at the first attempt and with the Swts moving to the Newcastle League for the   season, both teams performed a unique double by winning Divisions  and  while United reached and lost the Harry Clarke Cup final.United went to the Northern Amateur Football League for the   season and were promoted from Division B and they also reached the Irish Junior Cup only to lose to Moyola Park. They won the Division A title in  In the   season they lost the Irish Junior Cup final to st Bangor Old Boys while the Swts were probably the first reserve team to reach the Harry Clarke Cup Final which they lost after a replay to Downshire Hospital.Consecutive Cochrane Corry Cup finals were lost in   and  , as well as a second County Antrim Junior Shield final in .Manager Billy Hamilton, who had guided the team through the s so successfully, stood down at the end of the   season and then went on to become secretary of the County Antrim Football Association for a number of years. The playing strength within the club led to the formation of the Albion, in .In the mid s Ballynahinch Recreation folded. United took over the Millbridge playing fields and undertook signicant development work which led to it being admitted to Division C of the Northern Amateur Football League.Under the management of Bobbie Reid, they played their first games at intermediate level in the   season while the Swts switched to the NAFL reserve section, However the Albion remained in the Newcastle League.Success came quickly when Brian McKibbenrsquos team won the Border Regiment Cup in the   season after extra-time and penalties. Brian stood down as manager in  and through the efforts of Gerry McCormick and Cyril Lennon mid-table league positions were achieved.Under the leadership of club chairman Campbell Allen, great strides were being made with improvements to the drainage of the pitch, erection of tubular steel fencing around the pitch, construction of new dugouts and the erection of floodlighting to the training pitch with the clubhouse being substantially refurbished.For the   season Noel Dean was recruited as manager and he steered the team to their first and only promotion at intermediate level when they moved from Division B to A as runners-up to Dromara Village.The following season a mid-table position was achieved together with a memorable midweek Irish Cup replay defeat of Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge.Dean stepped down during the season and he was replaced by Michael Savage, who led the team to the final of the Clarence Cup which they were awarded as a result of Knockbreda Parish fielding an ineligible player.That same season the Swts, under manager Geoffrey Smith, lost the Purdy Cup final while Davy Teggartyrsquos Albion won the Bignian Cup and were also promoted to Division  as runners-up. Sadly, this team broke up and there followed a decade of struggle during which managers Eamon Wilson, Norman McCullough, Davy Teggarty and Alan Brown worked tirelessly to halt the downward trend.The occasional bit of encouragement came along with the Albion reaching two successive Shimna Cup finals in   and   only to lose out in penalty shoot-outs while in   the Albion won the Donard Dairy Shield defeating Castlewellan IIIs ndash.Campbell Allen stepped down due to business commitments and the current chairman Gilbert Cromie took over.In May  the club were awarded the honour of hosting the Britton Rosebowl International between the NAFL and the Scottish Amateur League at Millbridge.Nigel Neale managed the team for the   season, but resigned with ten matches remaining. Experienced first teamer Alan Stevens took over, assisted by John Jones, and they led the team to one of their highest finishes in years.Former manager Cyril Lennon came in for the   season and United enjoyed their highest league position for years. Stuart Buchanan came in as manager of the Swts and led them to the Newcastle  District League Division A title.The following season United again narrowly missed out on promotion, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the Intermediate Cup when they were defeated by Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge. The Swts re-entered the Northern Amateur League and were promoted as runners-up in Division E to Bangor Rangers.Much to everyonersquos disappointment, Cyril Lennon stepped down and Steven Bell took over along with John Jones and they led the team to a very respectable fourth place in Division B. United were awarded the North East Referees Association Merit Award for Fair Play at the AGM of the NAFL.The Swts continued their good form to finish runners-up to Downpatrick IIs in NAFL D, but manager Stuart Buchanan stepped down due to study commitments.In the summer of  the club celebrated its th anniversary which a special former playersrsquo night and a friendly match against Irish Premier League side Lisburn Distillery. The Albion managed by Johnny Reid won Division  of the Newcastle  District League.In   the club was awarded a % grant from the IFA to undertake an upgrading of its facilities to meet new Intermediate regulations.Steven Bell stood down in January . A new management team of Colin Murray and John Jones took over the role and they guided the first team to a fourth place finish on goal dference. Much to the clubrsquos disappointment the Albion had to be withdrawn from the Newcastle League due to a reduction in the clubrsquos player pool.In the   season the club embarked on its usual Irish Cup campaign little knowing that it would reach the fth round for the first time and be drawn against Premier Division side Coleraine. This brought about a wonderful adventure during which the club was able to garner a massive support which necessitated the ordering of two double decker buses for supporters as well as a bus for the team.Everything was done as professionally as possible and despite a heavy defeat, although the score was - at half time, the players and their management gained enormous respect.In more recent times the team has been managed by Keith Hamilton, Scott Brashaw and Ross Hayes as caretaker managers, Alan Davis and Paul Allison. In the current season, former player Glynn Robinson and Dale Davidson have taken on the role and have made a promising start with good results in both league and cup competition.Over the last  years the club has been involved in a number of proposed amalgamation initiatives involving Ballynahinch Recreation, Ballynahinch Olympic and Temple Rangers, but none materialised.One amalgamation that did happen was with Ballynahinch Youth Football Club, which now means that the club includes male and female from age six years forward and a ladiesrsquo senior team. This fits in superbly with the clubrsquos ethos of being inclusive to all within the local community which has been something that is reflected in its history from day one.It also brought to the club an outstanding group of coaches and administrators which has invigorated the club.No club could everwithout committed iniduals being involved in its organisation and the club has had a cadre of them over five decades.The passing of the clubrsquos elder statesman, Billy Hamilton senior, in December  brought to an end outstanding service not only within the club as a player and administrator, but also within the leagues and governing bodies.Billy was no stranger to working hard on the ground, putting up nets and marking the pitch both at Feersquos Field in Dromara and Millbridge, aided and abetted by club president Winston Brown, who works away in the background and has done so for  years.Jimmy Brown has toiled tirelessly and selflessly for well over  years, keeping Millbridge well-manicured as well as using his building, plumbing and plastering skills to maximum effect.In addition to Billy senior, the Hamilton family have made an outstanding contribution with Billy junior managing for over a decade. Graham scored hundreds of goals over those early years while Wilson mdash better known to all as Chico mdash played for all three teams and continues to serve as a committee member to the present day.We can never forget the contribution that Sally Hamilton has made as she continues to attend the home matches and has made the sandwiches served to visiting teams at the Millbridge for decades. In addition to managing the team and being involved administratively with the club, Bobbie Reid has served as the clubrsquos Newcastle League representative for many years. Last, but not least, there is Davy Teggarty, who has fulfilled every role possible.While all of these iniduals and others have helped over the years we are most fortunate to have a new generation who have stepped forward and will see the club move forward for which we are extremely thankful..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Peace lantern walk marking WWI end 100th anniversary  ","story":"A UNIQUE peace lantern walk is to be held in Killyleagh to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.The lantern will be carried in a relay chain from Shrigley to Killyleagh, and through its main streets, before a flame from it is used to light a gas beacon at the front of Killyleagh Castle on Remembrance night.A Killyleagh veteran, who is one of Northern Irelandrsquos last RAF survivors from the Second World War, has been given the honour of carrying the lantern on the final relay before the Beacon of Light is lit.Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, who is aged  and who survived more than  bombing missions as a rear gunner in Halax and Lancaster bombers in the Second World War, will light the beacon to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent in  after four years of the world at war.The Bomber Command veteran who still walks up to six miles a day and is one of Killyleaghrsquos most instantly recognisable residents, will be joined in the final relay of the cross-community walk by local schoolchildren and  unsung heroes from the local community.The Killyleagh Beacon of Light will be among the first of around  bonfires and beacons to be lit across Northern Ireland at pm at the end of Remembrance Sunday, as part of the Battlersquos Over commemorations on Sunday, November .Chris Hagan, the chairman of the Killyleagh Remembers the Great War project, revealed that an original candle and lantern, used on the th anniversary of the start of the war, will be used as part of a chain to light the beacon.ldquoWe extinguished a candle lantern in August  to mark  years from the beginning of the war, he said. ldquoIn remembrance of the end of the war and the millions who were killed or came home dreadfully wounded, the lantern will be lit again.ldquoThere were two bonfires lit in Killyleagh on the night the war ended at the Castle Square and at the Cross.

Armagh were largely at full strength with influential number  Neil Faloon passed fit.Armagh took an early lead with a penalty from promising young out-half Cormac Fox.The game then became entrenched around the halfway line with both sides either unwilling or unable to put any width on the ball due to the conditions.Armagh edged the possession and territory, but with defences well drilled on both sides it looked like only a mistake would provide any try-scoring opportunity on either side.There were a few fumbles from speculative kicks on both sides but defences were able to scramble into place and snuff out any chances relatively comfortably to leave the half-time score at -.The second half brought more of the same. Ballynahinch had to withstand a period of sustained Armagh possession, but did so without any major alarms.However, they were unable to stamp any real authority of their own on proceedings and as the match drted into its later stages it seemed that Armagh had done enough to escape with a famous win.Former Armagh man Richard Reaney had other ideas and he converted a penalty in the final minute to earn the home side a draw.Armagh will be happier with the result, but the Ballynahinch players and coaches will take the two points and move on to the tricky trip to Old Belvedere next week.The final round of the Celtic Cup took place last weekend, freeing up Ulster squad members for club rugby, but it remains to be seen how soon they become available.

A number of parked cars have also been damaged.It is being reported that some shops have closed early to protect staff, while residents who live near the historic Grove area in the shadow of Down Cathedral have revealed they have been verbally abused.Representatives from residentsrsquo groups in Stream Street, Bridge Street, Russell Park and Lynn Doyle Place have been invited to attend the meeting which they hope will result in an action plan being devised to tackle a problem caused by what some have described as ldquoferal youths.Grove Shopping Centre caretaker Peter Smyth, said businesses were frustrated that nothing is being done to address the problems and wanted local police to do more.ldquoBusinesses have had to pull down shutters either temporarily or shut early to protect staff in the St Patrickrsquos Square area, he said.ldquoWhile the trouble is largely centred on area between the Grove, the Saint Patrick Centre and the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway, it radiates out to town centre neighbourhoods and last week a number of young people climbed on to the roof at the nearby bus station.Anthony Trainor, of the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, said local people, including those who work in the town centre, have had their cars deliberately damaged.ldquoResidentsrsquo groups are telling us that there have been assaults on adults and children.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is believed that many others are not on the register and actually , people could be living with dementia in Northern Ireland.According to the latest statistics, the Ards and North Down borough has the highest prevalence of dementia in Northern Ireland, followed by Fermanagh and Omagh and Causeway Coast and Glens. The lowest rate among the  council areas was recorded in Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon.It is hoped people attending tomorrow’s event will gain an insight into the signs, symptoms and challenges that a diagnosis of dementia brings. With greater understanding of the condition, communities should become more accepting, tolerant of the symptoms and helpful towards people living with dementia.Dementia NI member, Allison Batchelor, said: “My diagnosis completely floored me. I was scared, angry, worried, depressed but at the same time relieved to eventually know what was wrong. Dementia NI is an organisation that was set up by five iniduals who had a dementia diagnosis because they felt people with dementia didn’t have a voice.“Dementia NI gives people with dementia a voice and empowers them to talk at events such as the Real Lives event to challenge the stigma of dementia.

The paper was founded a year earlier, in September  but all the earliest papers are lost:LONDON, Sept.  and . \u2028There are private Letters in Town which are filled with Accounts of the gallant Behaviour of the Right Hon. the Earl of Crawford, a Voluntierin the Russian Army, commanded by Count Munich all these Letters mention his Lordship having sustained an important Part in every Action that Army was engaged in, but are so far from saying any thing of his Lordship’s being killed, as was reported, that they assure us, that he has had the good Fortune to escape unwounded.[A war was raging between Russia and the Turks. The previous day’s paper had reported that the earl had been killed by a cannon ball, but news moved slowly in the s and was uncertain. This is an early example of the record being corrected in a bid to convey accurate news]FRANCE. Paris Oct . Last week a very old Man, who had , Livres in ready Money by him, wished to see himself possess of , before he died, for which Purpose he prevailed upon his Son to borrow  Livres for him as soon as he got that Sum, he shut himself up in his Closet in order to join it to his own Stock but while he was busy in telling over his Money in his Chest, the Lid of it fell upon his Head, and he was found dead the next Day. The Reward of CovetousnessBELFAST. Last Tuesday the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Hillsborough waited on the Rev. Presbytery of Bangor,in Order to have a dissenting Minister, whom his Lordship recommended to the Presbytery, settled at Hillsborough: It is not doubted but that the Presbytery will do what they reasonably can to graty his Lordship.[Trevor Hill, who was the first Viscount Hillsborough, died within four years of this report, while still only aged in his s. His son and heir Wills Hill later became a key British statesman as Secretary of State for the Colonies shortly before the July , American Declaration of Independence, which was reported on the front page of the News Letter in August of that year. A man who would become a founding father of the United States, Benjamin Franklin, visited Lord Hillsborough at Hillsborough Castle in . Later suggestions that the pair did not get on, helping precipitaterupture between Britain and the colonies, are disputed, and Franklin is said to have recorded that he was warmly treated by his host] The first two surviving News Letters from October  are the only early copies between September  and December .

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast. Industry STR Global figures for June revealed that occupancy rates in Belfast were down by around % after , new rooms were added.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
