Designer Mrs Hindmarch received a CBE in the 2017 New Year’s Honours while sitting on the economy committee.Mr Rittner, chief executive of the Royal Academy of Dance, got a CBE for services to the arts at the same time. He was a member of the arts and media committee. Dame Julia, former director of London’s Serpentine gallery, received her gong in the 2016 Birthday Honours while on the arts and media committee. And Labour MP Dame Rosie, then opposition chief whip, was honoured in the 2016 New Year’s Honours when she was sitting on the parliamentary and political service committee.Several civil servants received gongs despite being involved in the honours process. They do not appear to have sat on committees which dealt with their cases.In 2016 a knighthood went to Martin Donnelly, permanent secretary of the business department, despite sitting on the economy and education committees.Malcolm McKibbin, ex-head of the Northern Ireland civil service, was knighted that year while on the education and sport committees. Tom Scholar, permanent secretary at the Treasury, was knighted in 2017 while on the economy committee. Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, was knighted last year when on the health committee.And this month Sue Owen, permanent secretary of the culture department, was made a dame while on the arts, economy and sports committees.           It is believed recommendations for civil servants come from the state committee, which none of these people sat on.The revelations came just weeks after the furore surrounding the Queen’s Birthday Honours. The list was dubbed ‘rewards for failure’ after figures such as Mark Carne, the outgoing boss of Network Rail, received a CBE amid travel chaos for millions of commuters. It also emerged that three honours went to clients of a prominent literary agent who sits on one of the committees.These include historian Simon Schama, who received a knighthood, and author Jeanette Winterson, who was given a CBEThe Cabinet Office said systems were in place to ensure people were not involved in decisions regarding themselves or professional colleagues. The rules state people should declare an interest if they have a professional relationship with a potential recipient. If a committee member is put forward, they are not involved in discussions regarding the case – and should not even know it is being discussed.A spokesman for Dame Rosie said: ‘Rosie Winterton was nominated by the Labour Party. She did not play any part in the nomination process and was not present when her nomination was discussed.’Mr Rittner said: ‘I was not aware that I had been nominated for an honour, nor was I part of any discussions relating to my nomination ...

The increase in weight misperception in England is alarming and possibly a result of this normalisation.’There has been a rise on the high street in ‘vanity sizing’, where dress sizes are inflated for women with larger waists and hips and bigger busts, to flatter them that they wear a smaller size. Experts say this can ‘undermine’ action to lose weight.The study analysed the Health Survey for England, to find the answers of 23,459 people asked whether they were about the right weight, too heavy or too light.          A study of more than 23,000 people has found more than half of men do not recognise they are overweight or obeseThe results, analysed for five years between 1997 and 2015, show the proportion of overweight men in denial has leapt from 48.4 per cent to 57.9 per cent in that period. At the same time, the proportion of overweight women misjudging their weight has jumped from 24.5 per cent to 30.6 per cent.The study, published in the journal Obesity, says the normalisation of being large has become ‘widespread’ in England, with men most likely to ignore their weight problem.On the Marks \u0026amp Spencer range, Dr Muttarak wrote: ‘By introducing a new design and styling tailored for plus-size customers and using carefully selected fabrics complementing fuller figures, Curve primarily contributes to promoting body positivity.‘While this type of body-positive movement helps reduce stigmatisation of larger-sized bodies, it can potentially undermine the recognition of being overweight and its health consequences.’Among people who were overweight and obese, 38.5 per cent of men and 17.2 per cent of women thought they were ‘about the right weight’. The proportion of obese men misperceiving their weight in 2015 was almost double that seen in 1997.People who underestimated their weight were 85 per cent less likely to try to lose it, with only 51.8 per cent of those who were overweight in the study telling the Health Survey they were trying to shed the pounds.Almost two-thirds of adults in Britain are overweight or obese, with the study focusing on those with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or over, classed as overweight, and of 30 or over, classed as obese.Dr Muttarak, a senior lecturer in UEA’s School of International Development, said: ‘Identifying those prone to misperceiving their weight can help in designing obesity-prevention strategies targeting the specific needs of different groups.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/00/4D89066400000578-0-image-m-12_1529709003139.jpg","title":"So DID mayor Godalming hide sickening secret grooming long","story":"    Simon Thornton admitted making dozens of indecent images and films of the girl, who was 13But given what we now know about the 46-year-old, twice-married, father-of-one, it is impossible not to wonder if Thornton quietly suspected his enemies were already circling.This week, at Guildford Crown Court, the truth about his sordid past finally came out as he admitted 22 charges involving sexual relations with an underage girl.

The Tory councillor admitted 22 charges involving sexual relations with an underage girlThe town makes a regular appearance on \u0027best places to live in the UK\u0027 lists. Homes in Godalming are so desirable that it was once dubbed \u0027Celebrity Central\u0027.Among the rich and famous who have made homes in the area are TV presenter Chris Evans, rock legend Eric Clapton and racing driver Damon Hill.Singer Phil Collins used to live here. As did the late glam rocker Alvin Stardust. Actress Dame Penelope Keith and former Tory Cabinet minister Baroness Virginia Bottomley are also long-term residents.Indeed, the celebrity count is so high that one of Thornton\u0027s mayoral predecessors claimed she had to keep a prompt card so as not to forget the names of the area\u0027s countless illustrious residents.Thornton, a key figure in the Godalming Chamber of Commerce and a well-known face in the town even before he entered local politics in 2011, was able to pull the wool over the eyes of his fellow \u0027Godhelmians\u0027 for years.His prize-winning \u0027Godalming Sausages\u0027 were much sought after. As well as being elected Mayor by fellow town councillors in May last year, he was also, until his dramatic fall from grace, a Tory borough councillor.Sickeningly, as the Mail discovered this week, Thornton was even responsible for helping to draw up a new policy for safeguarding children for Waverley Borough Council in 2014 when he was grandly \u0027portfolio holder for children and young people\u0027.          Former town mayor Simon Thornton arriving at Guildford Crown Court with his new partner before being jailed for nine years for child abuse Certainly, no one suspected the charming, personable chap, who turned up in flamboyant suits and his smart gold chains of office to visit art exhibitions, judge community competitions or to launch the \u0027Dogalming\u0027 dog show, was hiding an evil past. Not even his first wife, a nursery nurse at a private prep school, appears to have realised the truth of what was going on, despite the fact that on occasions the teenage girl slept at their house — even in the marital bed.This, it was said in court, was all part of Thornton\u0027s deceitful scheme to \u0027normalise\u0027 his wicked behaviour among those around him.The first Mrs Thornton, who is 12 years younger than her ex-husband and was 20 when she married him in 2005, told friends she believed Thornton was simply being kind to the troubled girl.For legal reasons it is impossible go into precise details of Thornton\u0027s relationship with his teenage victim who is now a woman in her mid-20s.But in court it emerged that she was particularly vulnerable to his advances because of her own family life.In a statement she described how at the time she was desperate to get away from her childhood home.She believed that she loved Thornton and said that it was only after confiding in a school friend that she realised that his behaviour was wrong.          The town makes a regular appearance on \u0027best places to live in the UK\u0027 lists. Homes in Godalming are so desirable that it was once dubbed \u0027Celebrity Central\u0027\u0027Since then I have lacked self-respect for myself which has caused me to make poor decisions,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was forced to grow up too quickly and I have suffered depression.\u0027And yet for years she didn\u0027t tell on him — not until he appalled her by trying to reminisce about their \u0027relationship\u0027 with her when they met as adults by showing her a sex film he had made of them. She went to the police and he was arrested last October.By then, Thornton and his first wife had orced and he had remarried. After his arrest he telephoned his second wife from the police station and confessed his crime.Incredibly, the new Mrs Thornton has stood by him throughout, travelling to Guildford Crown Court with him in May for a plea and directions hearing and on Monday for his sentencing.Although she stopped short of entering the court room, as if she couldn\u0027t bear to hear the truth about her husband of just 18months. Perhaps she was swayed by the argument his defence team gave in court when they tried to mitigate his crimes by claiming Thornton\u0027s own childhood had been similarly miserable.Diagnosed with dyslexia, they said, he had attended a \u0027remedial school\u0027.For anyone who knows anything about Thornton\u0027s upbringing, it was a desperate argument indeed.Mr Thornton is the second youngest son of a middle-class family, who are well respected members of their community.As a child, it is understood, Thornton was often in trouble, with his parents putting his difficulties, in and out of school, down to his severe dyslexia.Aged 14, he got a part-time job working in a butcher\u0027s shop belonging to one of their neighbours.After leaving school at 16, Thornton began working there full-time. In 2000, when the owner retired, he bought the business from him, renaming the premises.Since then, Godalming Butchers has become one of the most high-profile food shops in town, thanks in part to Thornton\u0027s friendly, chatty personality. His artisanal sausages beat off competition from a local branch of Waitrose and a rival butcher to win a trophy in 2011.And yet what might have been regarded as a personal success story was tarnished by the less appealing aspects of his personality.He was, say locals who know him, overly competitive, especially when it came to buying — and driving — cars. His latest was a Porsche.Perhaps most tellingly of all — both his wives were considerably younger than him. His first marriage was said to have broken up because of his suspicious, controlling behaviour.It\u0027s hard to believe this is the man who was able to help shape Waverley Borough Council\u0027s Child safeguarding policy in 2014.W riting in the document\u0027s preface he said: \u0027Through our work as councillors, staff and contractors, we all come across children and their families.\u0027Occasionally we might see something that concerns us, and may worry that a child is at risk of being abused, harmed, neglected or exploited.\u0027Where this is the case, Waverley expects councillors, staff and contractors to act responsibly and report their concerns to the relevant part of Surrey County Council.\u0027He added: \u0027By taking action you could save a life.\u0027Council leader Julia Potts said in a statement: \u0027On behalf of everyone at Waverley Borough Council and Godalming Town Council we are all appalled by this news.\u0027My thoughts at this time are with the victim. It is clear that none of the crimes were committed during his time as a councillor.\u0027From the moment we were made aware of the investigation, both councils have been fully cooperative and supportive of the police and their enquiries.\u0027The two councils of which Thornton was a member — Godalming and Waverley — sit next door to each other in the heart of the town. Inside the early 20th century Borough Hall, Thornton sat beneath a portrait of the Queen and joined in the prayers that marked the start of each council meeting.In Godalming\u0027s historic High Street this week, several shoppers could be overheard discussing the case.One elderly man, standing just yards from Thornton\u0027s shop and the old-fashioned decorative Victorian bicycle still parked outside, called to two well-dressed ladies: \u0027Did you hear about our butcher?\u0027A sign outside his shop reads: \u0027As of 1st June The Godalming Butchers is under new ownership\u0027.Despite the heinous nature of his crimes, some of the townspeople still appear to be in forgiving mood.\u0027He\u0027s a very nice man.

Like her narrator, Mackmin grew up in a kind of commune in 1970s Norfolk. Both Mackmin and Nearly Thirteen had a poet father, a younger sister and an agoraphobic mother who drove a white Saab. Both were precocious, home-educated and excellent cooks. And both endured the spectre of abuse as they came of age in a rackety era of bohemian self-discovery.So the passage in Devoured in which Mummy runs out of Swallow’s Farm and bares her breasts in protest at a crop-spraying plane must, I assume, be true. “I made that up,” laughs Mackmin in triumph when we meet near her London home. “There are profound resonances with mine and my sister’s childhood, and massive acres of made-up stuff. I’d never written anything before and it was a visceral pleasure to invent stuff.”At this stage Mackmin is best known as a theatre director, acclaimed for productions of Tom Stoppard’s The Real Thing, Brian Friel’s Dancing at Lughnasa and a version of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, as well as new plays by the likes of Amelia Bullmore and Charlotte Jones. Bullmore’s Di and Viv and Rose tackles themes of women and work, and it was when Mackmin became a mother seven years ago, adopting a child in her mid-40s, that she turned to writing.“I stopped work thinking, ‘Great, now I’m going to be a mum’, and I woke up the next morning thinking ‘Urrrgh, I am my work,’” she says. “This bomb had exploded in my heart – who was I if I wasn’t working?” Writing, she says, “was the rope that I threw myself – clambering up this slippery wet rope out of the horror of it all”.Mackmin had been “pretending” she was going to turn her “crazy childhood” into a novel for years and now, having a wakeful child, she began writing in three-hour nocturnal bursts. “I know this sounds very unlikely and pretentious but I really didn’t imagine a single other person reading this book,” she says. “I just knew I had to keep doing something in all those awake hours that was properly me.”It is Mackmin’s fourth creative career, and all have been self-taught except her first, acting, for which she studied at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. She and her sister Scarlett, a choreographer to whom Mackmin remains very close, then became clothes designers, successfully teaching themselves to make wraparound clothes that fitted both their contrasting body shapes. Mackmin believes everyone is creative, but her fending-for-herself childhood bequeathed her a bewildering array of practical skills. “I can sew, I can make my own clothes, I can make my own shoes, I can build a bonfire from nothing, I can drive a tractor. Rabbit skinning? Boom! Job done. Disgusting but I can do it,” she laughs.She took the same approach to writing as directing. Mackmin says she always knew she wanted to direct a new play if she read it and could visualise exactly how she would do it. She pictured Devoured this way too. Throughout the novel, the narrator, Nearly Thirteen, looks down upon herself, as if she’s directing herself. Speech appears before the speaker is identified, and sentences are staccato short. This style is as experimental as Mackmin’s childhood, and she isn’t sure whether to attribute it to a lack of formal education or her dyslexia. “There was an urgency of breath and rhythm in using short sentences. When I read it out to myself, I felt, ‘That’s. What. I. Thought. Like’ as a child.”Its originality ensured it was rejected by dozens of cautious publishers until it reached Henry Layte, the Norfolk-based publisher and bookseller who discovered and co-published Eimear McBride’s A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing. “He gave one absolutely brilliant editorial note,” says Mackmin, suggesting “one big tweak. I will be grateful forever. He’s my kind of person. He’s funny and he’s direct to the point of almost rudeness which gives me enormous pleasure.” By coincidence, Layte lives a mile from where Mackmin grew up and loves cooking as much as she does.Devoured is rare among novels for being studded with recipes for everything from homemade glue to “chocolate idiot biscuits”. “They are all very good recipes,” says Mackmin – all from her childhood. Just as in Devoured, Mackmin’s father and mother and assorted friends were too busy making poetry or pots to cook for their children. “I could cook a six-course meal easily by the age of 10,” she says. “We didn’t know that we were running the house but we wanted to eat. Why would you not, if the ingredients are in the fridge and you’re starving and everybody else is too drunk or stoned?”Of all Devoured’s excoriating comic portrayals of wayward hippies, Nearly Thirteen’s Mummy – a matriarch who challenges norms of work, motherhood and marriage – is the most nuanced. One day, Nearly Thirteen hears a noise coming out of her bedroom like a lorry reversing. “Eurngh eurngh eurngh” Mummy is sleeping with other residents of Swallow’s Farm.Mummy is “a literary creation” says Mackmin, but her own mother, who recently died after developing Alzheimer’s, “inspired it, utterly and totally”. Two weeks before her mother died, Mackmin had a conversation with her in hospital. “I told her: ‘I’ve written a book, you are in it, it would’ve never happened without you, and I am so very grateful.’ She gave me one of those laser looks right to the back of my head, nodded, and turned away to carry on looking at an old bloke covered in trifle.” Could she have published Devoured if her mum was still alive? “I don’t know. Fortunately for us all, life doesn’t work like that. The origami shape of life allows things to be folded round a corner that you’re not quite sure about and then – ‘Oh look, I’ve made a swan.’”Devoured portrays a time when a generation of parents were preoccupied with their own liberation at the expense of providing children with the space or safety to be children. It is a funny book but an angry one too. “Yes, I have been angry but I’m not blameful,” says Mackmin. “I don’t blame my mum. My mum and indeed my dad were victims of that moment in history, of supposedly women’s emancipation and the psychotherapeutic generation – ‘oh me, me, me’ – putting themselves at the centre. Despite this ideology, they were still dragging behind them an idea of women where their bodies and sexuality were really the only thing that had any currency – and that’s what I was interested in.”Without giving too much away, one hippy befriends Nearly Thirteen in a way that today would be called grooming. I’m surprised when Mackmin says it’s not. “He’s doing what those adult children were doing – working out who he is by saying what he thinks in the moment. All of them are feeling themselves – feelings, feelings, feelings are everything. ‘I feel this and therefore I am,’ rather than ‘I feel this and therefore I’m going to think about it, and the cake I make out of the mix of those two will lead me forward.’”Did she experience abuse in her childhood? Mackmin speaks carefully. “I was around a reckless level of lack of care from the ‘adults’ to the children. I knew of too many children who were having sexual encounters with adults, far too many, and yes, it impacted upon me.”Mackmin believes she was saved from trauma by work, not therapy – and perhaps laughter too. She has poured all her good jokes, and knowledge of theatrical comedy, into Devoured. “Laughter is breath, it alters your being, and it allows you to move on, and keep living. I hope people find it funny but I hope they see that’s the point – it’s laughter as its most important function. It’s not just ‘ha ha ha, crazy hippies’, it’s ‘laugh or you’re going to end up full of bitterness and blame and picking the spot of your childhood forever.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4af83d8b8b26c4b59ea9b70c3845b33039d656c/0_4_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24a50c8fdf49a1a1f2121ef9a22a30e3","title":"book clinic which books best explain why life worth living camus sartre aristotle","story":"Which books can tell me, from a philosophical standpoint, what makes life worthwhile or worth living?Shamsheer Bakaf, 27, doctor and global health scientist, PakistanPhilosopher and author Julian Baggini writes:Surprisingly, few of the world’s great philosophers have directly addressed this question.

Aside from the occasional bit of scatological humour (scatology being the study of faeces … delightful), most of us happily steer away from regularly talking about it, for fairly obvious reasons.But, if you push past the initial icky revulsion of talking about human waste, you’d find out that it actually contains a vast amount of potential value in terms of energy, providing a sustainable form of fuel that we could all help supply.In 2015, research by the United Nations University found that human waste was a potential fuel source and if all of it was collected worldwide, annually it would be “great enough in theory to generate electricity for up to 138m households” – which is all of Indonesia, Brazil, and Ethiopia combined. An equivalent amount of natural gas would cost $9.5bn (£6.7bn).Poo-powered innovations are already happening, too. Earlier this year, a Worcestershire man made headlines when, fed-up with seeing bags littered across the scenic Malvern Hills, he designed a street lamp that runs on dog poo – two hours of light for every 10 bags of poo.There are companies across the UK that are also starting to explore the potential of poo power on a larger scale. Bristol-based renewable energy company GENeco is using sewage waste from the city to create green gas, which is then supplied to homes across the UK by Bristol Energy.“When sewage waste arrives at GENeco’s treatment plant in Bristol, it is treated and turned into what’s called ‘sludge’,” explains Bristol Energy renewables and origination manager Simon Proctor. “This forms the raw fuel for the anaerobic digestion plant.”During anaerobic digestion, organic matter – in this case, the sewage sludge – is broken down by microorganisms in an airtight container Proctor compares it to “the way a cow’s stomach breaks down grass”.This process produces methane-rich biogas, which is treated to remove impurities and ensure emissions are odour-free. The enriched biomethane is then injected into the gas distribution network. “It has the same quality as natural gas, and can be used in our homes as an alternative to fossil fuels,” Proctor says.The results are impressive. According to Bristol Energy, an average household’s weekly flushes could produce enough biomethane to cook a fry-up two weeks’ flushes could cook a roast dinner and annual flushes from every household in Bristol could fry 83m eggs.Biomethane was also used as fuel by GENeco to run a “Bio-Bus” shuttle to and from Bath and Bristol airport and also on a regular bus service within Bristol, aptly named the “number two route”. The bus travelled more than 180 miles on a tank of gas produced by the annual food and sewage waste of just five passengers.Sustainability is at the heart of the entire process. “Producing biomethane from sewage waste means that we don’t have to use fossil fuels,” Proctor says. “Burning fossil fuels is one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions in the UK. Switching the average UK home to renewable energy can save more than 1.5 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year, that’s equivalent to taking a car off the road for six months.”He also points out that while we can try to reduce other forms of waste, such as packaging, plastic or food, reducing the level of sewage waste “is obviously going to be more difficult” – making the process an important step towards a more sustainable world.Bristol Energy will also invest its profits back into the city, creating what Proctor calls a “circular economy”. “Sewage waste from Bristol is recycled into green gas our customers switch to a locally owned company and save money – and then our profits will go back into the local community,” he says.That doesn’t mean there aren’t drawbacks, however, particularly in terms of the adoption of the process. Installation and maintenance costs for anaerobic digestion systems can be high, and many companies have been forced to rely on government initiatives to keep running. Proctor says that support under such schemes has been “very ambiguous at times”, which could be, in part, what is preventing more companies from adopting similar systems.Prof Chris Metcalfe, director of the Institute for Watershed Science at Trent University in Canada, worked on the UN study into human waste. He believes that biogas should be considered a resource not only for energy production, but also as compost “for improving agricultural productivity” and for the recycling of water for irrigation.“In most cases, we’re wasting this resource by either putting the solids into landfill or by discharging the liquid sewage into lakes and rivers,” he says.The main issue, Metcalfe believes, is not the technology – in fact, he says there are no real technological barriers to the use of human waste as fuel. Instead, it’s “people’s attitudes about using human waste” that causes problems. “In many countries, the idea of collecting and using human waste is not culturally acceptable, even though animal manure is often used for biogas production,” Metcalfe explains.But Proctor says human waste is already being used more widely than we may think. This is evident across the world, where the process is increasingly being used to improve sanitation in developing countries. In India, where $20bn (around £14bn) of government funding has recently been put towards building sanitary toilets, social project SHRI (Sanitation and Health Rights India) uses an anaerobic biodisgestion system to provide electricity to pump ground water that is later filtered and sold, with profits paying for the ongoing maintenance of the toilets.It may not be glamorous, sexy or particularly futuristic it may still seem slightly icky. But it’s undeniable: whether it’s being used to fuel cars, buses or homes in the UK, or to improve sanitation conditions across the world, poo has the power to change lives.To find out more about how you can support green energy and save money on your bills, visit bristol-energy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc1da99d694643adfb07bbd517c57d36d0e9db1b/0_260_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b6172cc5ba8dac0e10f53e142b7e447","title":"dont wait worried workers call shorts on wages","story":"The bargaining power of the average British worker should be back to where it was when Tammy Wynette topped the charts with Stand By Your Man and the Rolling Stones announced an upcoming American tour with a performance from the back of a truck on Fifth Avenue.So much for the era of union power. By 1975 it was already waning. It’s true, the situation might have been worse without unions, but a general sense of impotence was felt by the wider workforce.These days there is a view that trade unions are not necessary for wages to rise at an accelerated pace. Andrew Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, is one of those who put little store by union power and more on the dynamics of the labour market.There are surveys that support his view. For instance, the latest feedback via the IHS Markit survey of household finances shows that people have not felt so secure in their jobs since this particular survey began in 2008.A sense of security is one of the building blocks of bargaining power. When workers believe they are unlikely to be made redundant and they look around to see huge numbers of advertised vacancies, a hefty wage rise should be in the bag.Haldane voted for a rise in interest rates last week along with two other members of the central bank’s monetary policy committee, largely, it seems, to calm down runaway wage rises, or at least the imminent threat of an inflation-inducing pay bonanza.Surveys are one thing, hard data is another. And David Blanchflower, the labour market expert and academic, says the data points in the opposite direction. His reasoning can be found in his latest assessment of global employment trends, co-written with Stirling business school professor David Bell.That’s because the Bank is blinded to the effect of under-employment, says Blanchflower, just as the US Federal Reserve fails to consider the impact on the labour market of a low participation rate and the huge number of workers who neither have a job nor claim benefits. In both cases, there is in effect an army of under-employed people who are ready to take work and thereby limit the potential for wage rises.Under-employment can be seen in the figures showing the amount of extra hours people want to work, and especially part-time workers who want full-time employment.Why? According to Nobel economics laureate Ned Phelps, the 2008 financial crisis is to blame. It shook workers to their core and robbed them of any confidence.Blanchflower, a former MPC member and professor at Dartmouth College in the US, says in-depth breakdowns of official data show the demand for extra hours is growing and keeping pay in check. It means the age of anxiety trumps the unemployment rate. It means the central bank’s chief economist is wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12c32b8c92c3f3f30ffa40040ac068051db126e4/183_22_3433_2060/master/3433.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42a6bc9041264bf445fe011dc7781b04","title":"love island is a rorschach test see what you want to see","story":"On Friday, an evicted Love Island contestant appeared on Daily Politics alongside Nigel Farage and Alastair Campbell to talk about Brexit. Hayley Hughes, from Liverpool, has achieved fame and notoriety beyond the show’s traditional audience for not knowing what Brexit means, before asking on the reality TV series whether it will lead to fewer trees in the UK. But her appearance on Daily Politics had more to do with the fact that, for those in Westminster not preoccupied with the World Cup, a not insignificant proportion of the political class is obsessed with another summer knockout tournament: the grafting, coupling up and mugging off of a group of suntanned under-30s in a villa in Mallorca.This obsession is not confined to Westminster: this year’s Love Island is bringing in record audiences for ITV2. Its opening programme was watched by a peak of 3.4 million viewers, surpassing the audience for last year’s final by a million and making it the highest-ever for the channel. It is becoming such a hit that people are starting to look for hidden meanings behind its popularity. Love Island has turned into a Rorschach test, revealing to the viewer what they want to see, only maybe with a splodge of Fake Bake fake tan instead of an inkblot.Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former head of Ofsted, sees the Bafta-winning series as an “appalling” indictment of England’s education system. He may have been talking about Hughes’s comments about Brexit, although who can blame her for not really knowing what’s going on when the negotiations have been so tortuous? He may have watched long enough to hear Hughes confuse the concept of a city, county and country, and wonder whether Spain is part of the UK. Or perhaps he couldn’t follow what Dani, the daughter of actor Danny Dyer, meant when she said: “He mugged you off but you mugged him off harder.” But then Sir Michael would also have to admit he knows Alex is an A\u0026ampE doctor and Zara is a policy adviser at the Department for Education.For feminist MPs such as Jess Phillips, Lucy Powell and Stella Creasy, some of Love Island’s biggest fans in Westminster, there are plenty of moments of female empowerment, most notably when Adam, the villa love rat, is called out twice by his partner Rosie for his philandering. It was after the second\u0026nbspof these confrontations, when Adam smirked at Rosie for getting upset and blamed her for his bad behaviour, that Women’s Aid issued a statement highlighting emotionally abusive behaviour and gaslighting.Rosie’s parting shot to Adam – “Enjoy the next bombshell that walks in because this one’s done” – won her an army of female fans. Adam’s bad behaviour was uncomfortable to watch yet this was not, as some have suggested, the producers normalising emotional abuse, but, rather, them exposing it. Everyone, including Rosie, could see what it was. For the audience, Adam is the No 1 hate figure who will be voted out at the next opportunity.No one can possibly claim that Love Island holds a mirror up to our society, unless that society is largely white, heterosexual and does two hours in the gym every morning with 36kg kettlebells. If it is anything, it is the walking, talking version of the Instagram influencer class. There are problems with a format that hothouses sexual attraction, often at the expense of real people’s feelings. While the islanders have devoted many hours to finding Alex a woman to couple up with, nobody in the villa seemed to care that Samira, the only black woman on the show, was also without a romantic partner – until she was chosen by newcomer Sam. One of the contestants, Niall, had to leave the show for personal reasons within days of arriving in the villa. There are psychologists, as well as first aiders, on standby.But we shouldn’t overanalyse Love Island as an excuse to watch it. Maybe the inkblot is just an inkblot. Anyone can pretend to be only interested in watching Inspector Montalbano on BBC Four. It’s harder to openly admit that the highlight of your evening is someone sitting up from their sunlounger to declare: “I’ve got a text!” or to wonder why Dani dries her eyelashes with a hairdryer. Maybe it is best to treat Love Island like a holiday romance: don’t take it too seriously, just enjoy it while it lasts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/617b3c389dca853889294d2e32bf195c1551340b/70_0_1812_1087/master/1812.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e23339b65b100f7f4571a6df21b56e13","title":"steve hiltons silence speaks volumes about hollow men on the right","story":"TS Eliot didn’t get it quite right. The world doesn’t end with a whimper but a giggle, which reveals that cruelty and lies can pass unchallenged. What was once outrageous is now just a joke at the expense of humourless moralists who don’t understand how obsolete their scruples have become. The laughter comes loudest from the “left behind”. Not the working class, but the left-behind elite who attach themselves to far rightwing (and on occasion far leftwing) movements because they boil with resentment that they no longer have or were never been offered the status they took to be their entitlement.Donald Trump, Rupert Murdoch and, to an extent, Boris Johnson are examples that walk among us. As are so many rightwing “contrarian” journalists who show their independence of mind by never contradicting their readers’ prejudices. The origins of their bitterness are wholly obscure to outsiders: how can Murdoch, for example, believe a British establishment that fell at his feet has “slighted him”? But the psychic wounds are real enough in their minds and allow them, however deceitfully, to connect with the humiliations of their base.If today’s radical rightwing movements are filled with sore losers – nervous members of the left-behind white working and middle classes, who see immigration destroying their culture and economic stagnation destroying their security – they are led by sore winners. Unlike the 20th-century fascist movements, the leaders of the “alt-right” were either born to wealth, as Trump, Murdoch and Johnson were, or, like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Putin, have been in power so long they have nothing to feel insecure about. Their privilege ensures that laughter in the form of the sneer of the victor and the snigger of the abuser comes naturally.If you’re from the old world, nothing could be less funny than the overmighty state tearing immigrant children from their parents and locking them in cages. The imprisonments were not a bureaucratic error but the result of a deliberate act by the Trump administration to create a “hostile environment”, as British conservatives would put it. Migrants would not think of coming to America if they knew that child snatchers would circle their kids. Such premeditated inhumanity demands honest reporting so that everyone, especially its supporters, understands the moral consequences.If you want to see the authentic mentality of fascism old and new, watch the clip of Trump ideologue Ann Coulter asserting on Murdoch’s Fox News that the stolen toddlers sobbing “Daddy! Daddy!” were “child actors”.Lies bind a political or religious tribe together. Fox News viewers and perhaps Coulter herself might know what she is saying is not true. By acting as if they believe outrageous falsehoods, they announce they are so dedicated to the conservative cause they will believe anything its propagandists produce and so determined to insult Latinos they will endorse any lie told about them. The reaction of Fox’s host was more telling than standard self-deceit. Steve Hilton, a privately educated Englishman, considered challenging Coulter. He mumbled a few words as if he were about to protest. But then he pulled himself together and did something as shocking as the oppression Trump had enforced and the calumnies Coulter had advanced: the little creep giggled, made a lame joke, then called for the ad break.Any competent surgeon could locate Hilton’s wound. He was once at the centre of power. He helped draft David Cameron’s modernising conservatism and was all for caring about the environment and using the internet to empower citizens. His thought was largely vacuous: Hilton was against big bureaucracies and in favour of children being free to enjoy “wholesome play” (I haven’t made this up). He was banal, but his was not the banality of evil.His career fell apart in 2012. Cameron lost patience with him and he left Downing Street. The former Tory guru, who was once the centre of attention, had joined the left-behind elite. If he was known, he was known because of his wife, a successful Silicon Valley executive – and not all men are happy with being upstaged by their partners. Once a somebody, Hilton was a nobody. He did what yesterday’s men have always done and jumped on the next big thing, which in the case of rightwing politics was the Trump movement. A job at Fox followed and the nobody was a somebody again.I’ve saved the best for last. Hilton is the child of Hungarian refugees who fled communist oppression and found a safe home in Britain. Now he can do nothing but stretch his mouth into an inane grin when the bureaucracy he once abhorred cages the children of today’s refugees and his fellow conservatives slander its victims as actors.The far right’s laughter recalls Sartre’s comment in 1944 that antisemites amuse themselves and “delight in acting in bad faith”. The calculation that embracing Trump is the smart career move recalls Dorothy Thompson’s warning in her 1941 essay, Who goes Nazi?, to watch out for the man who has risen beyond his real abilities and “whose sole measure of value” is success. If the Nazis were a minority movement, it would not attract him. “As a movement likely to attain power, it would.”Not that Hilton or even Murdoch have found power by attaching themselves to Trump. If Hilton had spoken out, Fox News viewers would have turned on him. I have heard wistful liberal Republicans say if only Murdoch and his sons would tell Fox to drop Trump, American conservatism could crawl out of its sewer. They do not understand how deep the rot has set. If the Murdoch family tried to change course, Fox would lose its audience, as surely as Republican politicians who challenged Trump have lost their seats. The iron law of autocracy is that the strongman rules and his courtiers, however grand, obey.All they can do is to fix a smile on their sagging faces and giggle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e83a593cb0c571d783419052bb8481e173629bc/0_152_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ef9a78f0f7a93ef1f328c46d59e5d62","title":"a level maths paper leaked online night before exam edexcel","story":"Watchdog investigates after Edexcel C4 paper allegedly offered for sale at £200An A-level maths paper was allegedly leaked on the internet the night before thousands of students sat the exam.The exams watchdog Ofqual said it was working with Pearson, the company that owns the Edexcel exam board, “to establish the facts” after the C4 maths paper apparently appeared for sale online on Thursday night. Students reported seeing the paper for sale at £200, with sellers said to be offering the first question for free to prove they had it. Ofqual said in a statement on Friday: “We are aware of the allegations of malpractice or wrongdoing in relation to Edexcel’s C4 maths paper taken today. We are working with Pearson to establish the facts. “We recognise the concerns of students, who should continue to prepare for their forthcoming exams as normal. If anyone has information relevant to these allegations we would urge them to contact Pearson or us in confidence.”It is not the first time Pearson has been rocked by leaked exam papers. Last year it was forced to amend two maths papers at the last minute after reports some students had gained access to them in advance. In a statement made through the Edexcel Twitter account, Pearson said it was aware of claims of “a limited breach of security”.“As is usual practice in these circumstances, we have opened an investigation into whether there has been any exam malpractice. We are also contacting the police on this issue. “We’d like to reassure all students that the planned exams next week will continue as scheduled and that we have established processes in place to ensure no students will be advantaged or disadvantaged in any way.” Students who sat the exam discussed on social media their fears that they may be forced to resit, and their anger at the exam board over the leak. “I am actually so angry. Some of us gave our all to these exams so we could be proud of the grades we get at the end,” one student tweeted. Another said: “This is disgusting. It’s totally unfair on the people doing everything they can to get a grade.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6724464028a346ff6dbf33bec080f50b434900c1/0_0_4928_3280/master/4928.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c5f0228aab8476fe6e981bc7591ef33","title":"kim jones makes dior debut with paris menswear show","story":"The British designer’s first collection drew on the fashion house’s rich heritageFor his first, hotly anticipated Christian Dior collection, Kim Jones went back to the beginning. The British designer mined the Dior archive for inspiration to pay tribute to the man who established the fabled brand in 1946.“The collection is really based on Mr Dior’s personal life,” Jones told the Observer at a preview in the Rue Marignan atelier. “It is the idea of looking at different parts of his life.”Jones made his debut in Paris on Saturday afternoon as artistic director for Dior Men, the rechristened Dior Homme, completing the changing of the guard for the springsummer 2019 season. In a tribute to Dior and to his own heritage, Jones invited Prince Nikolai of Denmark to start the show. “I’m half Danish and Mr Dior always had that thing with royalty, and so I thought it would be nice to open with a prince – quite glamorous isn’t it?”Jones had only been at the brand for three months, following his departure from Louis Vuitton in January, and admits he didn’t have much time to dig deep. The elements he focused on in this first collection, however, will resonate with aficionados of the fashion house. Toile du jouy patterns from the wallpaper in the first Dior boutique were used on jacquards and leathers botanical emblems referenced Dior’s love of horticulture the famous cut used by Dior himself inspired the tailoring and the name of the new jacket, the Tailleur Oblique and pink and grey, shades synonymous with the brand, were used throughout.This aesthetic approach lends itself to a softer, more relaxed Dior Men than we are used to seeing. Jones’s predecessor, Kris Van Assche, who has since moved to fellow LVMH-owned brand Berluti, favoured dark palettes and sharp tailoring during his 11-year tenure. Before him, Hedi Slimane was lauded for his skinny suits – Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld was said to have lost more than 40kg to fit into one of Slimane’s creations.The show notes said that this was about “translating a quintessentially feminine couture identity into a masculine idiom.” This intention mostly resonated with the striped tailoring that appeared to be similar to the lining of a suit, but had sheer organza overlays.There were, however, sportswear influences footwear featured trainer, shoe and boot hybrids, while baseball pumps and caps completed most looks. In the new Dior Men world order, this is representative of “contemporary masculinity”.To elevate the collection, Jones featured couture techniques with pieces such as the appliquéd feather and bead-embellished shirts. Trench coats were crafted from embroidered tulle and organza, while hand-sewn florals were layered with screen printed silk. Through transparent vinyl, florals and feathers – representing the ceramics found in Dior’s personal archive – could be seen. “We wanted to have very light touches, so that it has an ease to it and makes it effortless,” explained Jones.The bags will be a main takeaway from the collection. The brand’s famous Saddle bag has been made for the first time for men, and came in taupe and black backpacks, cross-body and belt-bags. The latter swung as the models walked to the sounds of Underworld’s Born Slippy and Orbital’s Halycon in a soundtrack mixed by the DJ Diplo. There were plenty of playful accessories that will, no doubt, attract a young audience. Dior’s favourite dog was called Bobby, so Dior Men’s jewellery designer, Yoon Ahn, created rhinestone-embellished dog-bone keyrings, as well as a perfume dispenser in the shape of the dog and its owner. Double rings (for two fingers) are made from precious stones, such as lapis lazuli, onyx and amethyst, while iPhone cases have finger grips spelling out the brand’s name so that “when you take a selfie in the mirror, you can see Dior”. Jones has also collaborated with New York-based artist Kaws, otherwise known as Brian Donnelly, on reimagining the famous Dior bee, the emblem synonymous with the house. This came embroidered on floral shirts, as well as accessories. Donnelly created a BFF doll (already popular on Instagram) dressed in clothes from the springsummer 2019 Baby Dior collection. He also created the set for the show, with an imposing 10ft floral BFF version of Mr Dior – made from pink, white and black roses and peonies – holding a white version of the Bobby perfume bottle. Elsewhere, Matthew Williams of 1017 Alyx 9SM made the metal buckles seen on accessories, while milliner Stephen Jones reimagined headwear from the archive also.Jones is happy to share the limelight with his collaborators and encourages new design talent. The London-born Central Saint Martins graduate has been prominent on the fashion scene since his teens. After setting up his eponymous label shortly after graduating, Jones was headhunted by Dunhill to be its creative director, only to be poached by Louis Vuitton to design its menswear line three years later, a role he held for seven years.Only two weeks before his Saturday debut, the 44-year-old was in London supporting friends Edward Crutchley and David Beckham at their London fashion week men’s shows. (Beckham was the first person to wear one of Jones’s Dior creations, at last month’s royal wedding).There’s a lot of love for Jones. Models Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, who both walked the lap of honour with Jones as he took his final bow at Vuitton, Victoria Beckham, rapper A$AP Rocky, actor Gwendoline Christie and Kim Kardashian were among friends who arrived early in Paris to congratulate Jones in the Dior atelier as he completed final fittings.So too, was Virgil Abloh, Jones’s Vuitton successor, who showed his first collection on Thursday. Jones, who was there cheering, told the Observer that Abloh and his mentor, rapper Kanye West, used to sleep on his sofa 12 years ago when they were all trying to make it. “It’s nice to go full circle with friends,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a16fc1af9749b7e0e803488ee450252fb2c4dc/0_1257_5504_3302/master/5504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12756de6ad8d70e6d382d0dac50ecb5f","title":"david lynch gotta be selfish twin peaks","story":"The Twin Peaks director lives for his work. He talks about his four marriages, why explaining his films is a ‘crime’, and what makes him a happy camperDavid Lynch seldom smiles in photographs. His etched Easter Island statue of a face doesn’t glower so much as brood lips pursed and eyes hooded, he looks every inch the auteur in winter. The quiff completes the effect, its lush swirl seemingly frozen in place by alarming, Lynchian thoughts.In his 40 years of film-making, the director has taken audiences from sunlit American idylls to surreal dimensions populated by demons, doppelgangers and psychotic killers. His are scenes you can’t forget: the whimpering, deformed baby in Eraserhead, the severed ear in Blue Velvet, the blood-spattered, skull-crushing violence of Wild At Heart, the nuclear explosion in Twin Peaks: The Return. Google “David Lynch creepy”, and you get 5.5m results.Lynch works from a studio on a slope above one of three adjacent homes he owns in the Hollywood Hills, just a stone’s throw from Mulholland Drive. He is reclusive and seldom leaves this little realm, let alone grants audiences to journalists – but he is prepared to now, on the eve of publishing an unconventional memoir-cum-biography, Room To Dream. An assistant escorts me through the house (sleek concrete walls and surfaces, floor-to-ceiling shelves of VHS cassettes and CDs) and up through the garden to the studio. A snake slithered across the path earlier this morning, the assistant says.Lynch sits in a corner, hunched over a lithograph. The tabletop brims with paint pots, lotions, chemicals, gel formula cement, lithographic paper, pneumatic drills, cables, wires and paintbrushes. There is a mug of coffee, a pack of cigarettes. The director wears cracked, ancient boots, ragged chinos and the remnants of a black buttoned-up shirt that looks to have been shredded by a badger.It’s a scene that might be intimidating were it not for a great, largely untold secret: David Lynch is a cheery, congenial soul who rivals the Simpsons character Ned Flanders for howdy-doody niceness. “Hey, bud!” he greets the assistant, offering me a handshake and wide smile. He laughs, often, and yearns for peace on Earth. “I love my life and I’m a happy camper,” he says. “It would be nice if we were all able to fulfil our desires and live good, long, happy lives.”The studio is a bunker-like structure of concrete and glass that overlooks a panorama of trees, bougainvillea and villa rooftops. You can feel the morning sun and hear birdsong. “I like it up here, the trees,” Lynch says, speaking with the halting lilt of Gordon Cole, the FBI agent he plays in Twin Peaks (only without the deafness). “It’s a feeling I get in LA, a feeling of freedom. The light, and the way the buildings are not so tall. You can do what you want.” Would he like a coffee, his assistant asks? “Yeah, I’m about ready for a hot one, thank you.” There is no toilet up here, so to save trekking down to the house the boss pees into a sink built into the wall. “See that thing with the handle? It pulls out,” Lynch explains. “You can pee right in there. Then you run the faucet.”A large canvas standing in the middle of the studio, an unfinished work, depicts a tree with children. Closer scrutiny reveals that the boy standing at the base is holding a knife. A girl on the branch above is cowering. Another girl is dangling from a noose. Neither look like candidates for good, long, happy lives.You can find suffering and death anywhere if you look, Lynch says. The other day, a spider’s web next to his desk snagged a bee. The bee broke free, only to get snagged again. “The spider came out, started wrapping him, and pretty soon the spider had him wrapped completely. And I think bit him, too. Then he undoes the packaging and drugs him and drags him.” Lynch smiles at the memory. “Man, that is a violent thing.” LA is glorious, he says, “but you see things.”What Lynch sees, and then puts on screen for us to see, is one of the great enigmas of cinema, one that has launched a thousand film studies PhDs. When the director looks at a manicured lawn, his mind’s eye tunnels beneath it to hidden mystery, mysticism and depravity – visions he has turned into mind-bending television and film. It’s an oeuvre people tend to love or detest, and even devotees don’t claim to fully understand. With the exception of The Elephant Man (1980) and The Straight Story (1999), his films are oblique and non-linear. Who is the chipmunk-cheeked Lady in the Radiator who crushes sperm-like worms while singing to the father of the mutant baby in Eraserhead? How much of Mulholland Drive is real, or dreamed by Naomi Watts’ aspiring actor? And is the ending really the beginning?Lynch is the last man to provide any answers but now, at the age of 72, he has opened up – sort of – in his 577-page doorstopper of a book. Room To Dream declares itself at the outset to be a chronicle of events, not an explanation of their meaning. Chapters alternate between Lynch’s own recollections and those of his friends, relatives and collaborators, as told to his co-author Kristine McKenna. There is his boyhood in 1950s middle America, his early painting career, his four marriages – to Peggy Lentz, to Mary Fisk, to his longtime editor and producer Mary Sweeney, to the actor Emily Stofle – as well as his relationships with other women. What emerges is not so much Lynch, but two very distinct Lynches: the single-minded and reclusive visionary who is also a savvy media player the hermit who very consciously nurtures his brand.He is at his most animated when discussing ideas. “They’re like fish. If you get an idea that’s thrilling to you, put your attention on it and these other fish will swim into it. It’s like a bait. They’ll hook on to it and you’ll get more ideas. And you just pull them in.”When he puts a story on screen, he does not think in term of beats or plot points. “No, it’s a feeling, more of an intuition. It’s the idea that you’ve fallen in love with, and you try to stay true to that. You see the way that cinema can say that idea, and it’s thrilling to you.”He is not about to make a big-screen film any time soon: while he loves the superior sound and picture quality of cinema, Lynch thinks theatrical releases have become too short. “I would not make a feature film in today’s world because the kind of films I make couldn’t be on the big screen for very long.” Better, then, to make shows for television, a medium that is more comfortable with loose ends and narrative culs-de-sac, where he can tell a “continuing story”.There is a theory that Lynch himself doesn’t always know what is going on in his stories. He shoots this down. “I need to know for myself what things mean and what’s going on. Sometimes I get ideas, and I don’t know exactly what they mean. So I think about it, and try to figure it out, so I have an answer for myself.”Audiences, however, must do their own figuring out. “I don’t ever explain it. Because it’s not a word thing. It would reduce it, make it smaller.” These days he rarely gives interviews, not even during the hugely hyped return of Twin Peaks last year – a show that is still debated as either the best or worst TV of 2017. “When you finish anything, people want you to then talk about it. And I think it’s almost like a crime,” he explains. “A film or a painting – each thing is its own sort of language and it’s not right to try to say the same thing in words. The words are not there. The language of film, cinema, is the language it was put into, and the English language – it’s not going to translate. It’s going to lose.”Lynch takes a cigarette, lights up and inspects his work table, perhaps wishing he could express himself with the gel formula cement rather than these slippery, inadequate words.A film or TV show is like a magic act, he continues, “and magicians don’t tell how they did a thing”. He hates the idea of behind-the-scenes footage or making-of films about special effects. “People do it for sales, for money. But the film is the thing and should be protected.”So no guidance on Twin Peaks: The Return’s finale, which fleetingly resolved some storylines only to fracture them and create new puzzles? Even diehard fans yearned for clarity.He does, however, squash the theory, much loved by some Peakers, that the last two parts of the 18-hour series should be watched simultaneously on two screens, with dialogue overlapping. “Yeah, I heard that. It’s bullshit. See, it’s beautiful that someone came up with this. You could double-expose scenes in lots of films and it could conjure some fantastic thing.”I heard plenty of other theories at Twin Peaks: The Return’s gala premiere last year, a glitzy affair in downtown Los Angeles where the guests drank cocktails and wore tuxedos and gowns. Lynch and his co-creator, Mark Frost, had such tight control over the script and the edit that the audience had no idea what to expect – not even the Showtime studio executives who had paid for the entire series. Tight smiles masked a collective thought: please God, don’t let it suck.Lynch made a gnomic speech about trees, then the curtains parted and the first two hours rolled, reuniting Agent Cooper, the Log Lady, Laura Palmer and other characters last seen in 1991. Kyle MacLachlan’s Dale Cooper was still trapped in an extra-dimensional Black Lodge, amid an even stranger universe a school principal was arrested on suspicion of beheading a librarian a young couple were violently killed by a ghostly entity which sprang from a glass box. There was also a talking tree.When it ended there was a hush, followed by thunderous applause. The most popular adjective at the after-party was “mind-blowing”. Nobody understood the plot or seemed to like the characters, but it didn’t matter: Lynch was a genius.I found one heretic, a Dutch journalist, who confessed he had been bored. Other guests bristled: could he not see the brilliance? The Dutchman filed a negative review but his editors ran a different one, proclaiming a television milestone. The Lynch train was rolling.As Twin Peaks: The Return progressed, even fans acknowledged there was a kind of masochism to watching it – witness a two-and-a-half-minute scene in which a man does nothing except sweep a floor. When Cooper finally escapes the Black Lodge back into the real world, the FBI agent is reborn as a dullard insurance salesman – a character so slow and monosyllabic it is sometimes physically painful to watch his scenes opposite onscreen wife Naomi Watts.“This withholding of pleasure is Twin Peaks’ new secret weapon, and it works,” wrote the ’s Stuart Heritage. Others disagreed, the Hollywood Reporter branding the reboot a “self-indulgent, pointless, meaningless… exercise in misplaced nostalgia and auteur idol-worship”.When I ask Lynch if this kind of thing stings, he says he tends not to read reviews. “The good ones aren’t good enough, and the bad ones will depress you.”Nor does he see much other TV or cinema. When I ask what he likes to watch, Lynch says crime shows and car shows, but declines to elaborate. His favourite film of the past year? He goes silent and scrunches his face, thinking, thinking, thinking. The silence stretches. He puffs on the cigarette. Later I check the tape. Not a word for 46 seconds.He must have seen some. The Shape Of Water?Does he have any curiosity about them?“Not really. I never was a movie buff. I like to make movies. I like to work. I don’t really like to go out.”But these days you can watch them at home.In Room To Dream, Lynch says he used to be angry and thought this gave his work an edge. Then he took up transcendental meditation (TM), lost the anger and gained better focus. He has evangelised about TM ever since, dedicating his book to the late Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi “and the world family”. Sceptics take note: this highly caffeinated, pack-a-day smoker is possibly the least jittery person in Hollywood.He also believes in reincarnation, which keeps him Zen about growing old and losing friends and colleagues, including Twin Peaks: The Return collaborators Harry Dean Stanton, Miguel Ferrer and Catherine Coulson (the Log Lady), all of whom have died since filming. “Life is a short trip but always continuing,” he says, tapping ash. “We’ll all meet again. In enlightenment you realise what you truly are and go into immortality. You don’t ever have to die after that.”Politically, meanwhile, Lynch is all over the map. He voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary and thinks – he’s not sure – he voted Libertarian in the presidential election. “I am not really a political person, but I really like the freedom to do what you want to do,” says the persecuted Californian smoker.He is undecided about Donald Trump. “He could go down as one of the greatest presidents in history because he has disrupted the thing so much. No one is able to counter this guy in an intelligent way.” While Trump may not be doing a good job himself, Lynch thinks, he is opening up a space where other outsiders might. “Our so-called leaders can’t take the country forward, can’t get anything done. Like children, they are. Trump has shown all this.”Room To Dream contains no Rosebud revelation, no key to unlock Lynch, though it does offer clues in his childhood. A happy boy, he grew up in a loving extended family and made friends easily. They biked, hiked, built backyard forts. His mother, an English language tutor, would not give him colouring books in case they restricted his imagination. With his father, an agriculture research scientist, he inspected diseased and decaying trees they also hunted deer, skinning and eating them. Lynch recounts a memory of flies crawling on a porcupine they shot.There is another striking scene from childhood. One night, Lynch writes, he encountered a beautiful naked woman walking down the street, bruised and traumatised. “It was so incredible. It seemed to me that her skin was the colour of milk, and she had a bloodied mouth.” He was too young or too transfixed to find out who she was before she vanished.After art school, Lynch hustled for years to make Eraserhead, widely believed to be a response to the birth of his first child, Jennifer, who had club feet. Cineasts still debate what the onscreen infant was made of: skinned rabbit, lamb foetus? But when I ask Lynch he bats it away. “I don’t talk about the baby.”Eraserhead landed Lynch a job directing The Elephant Man. His attempt to personally mould and apply John Hurt’s makeup failed, forcing him to hire a specialist and triggering an extraordinary bout of self-reproach. “I thought it would be better to kill myself because I could hardly stand to be in my body,” he writes. He recovered only to clash with Hurt’s co-star, Anthony Hopkins, who deemed the young American out of his depth and tried to get him fired. Mel Brooks, who produced the film, recalls an angry phone call from Hopkins but not an explicit demand to fire Lynch. In any case, he defended his director and shepherded The Elephant Man to eight Oscar nominations in 1980. Brooks remains a fan, telling Lynch’s co-author: “He’s all screwed up, too, of course, and he projects his own emotional and sexual turmoil into his work and assaults us with the feelings he’s being assaulted by.”One of the great puzzles about Lynch is his relationship with women. He writes strong female leads, and has worked for years with many of the same actors (Naomi Watts, Laura Dern, Sheryl Lee) yet the frequent onscreen violence has led to accusations of misogyny. Offscreen, he can be brutal when it comes to the end of a relationship. In Room To Dream, Isabella Rossellini that Lynch laughed while shooting her rape scene with Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet, and “I still don’t know why.” Rossellini went on to have an affair with the director, a relationship that ended his marriage to Mary Fisk. “My heart was truly broken, and I was walking around like a lost person with blood dripping from every pore,” Fisk tells McKenna. She has since forgiven him.Throughout the book, and in his own telling, it is clear that Lynch’s most enduring passion is work. When his current wife, Emily Stofle, an actor who appeared in Inland Empire and Twin Peaks: The Return, became pregnant, he warned her that film would still come first. Their daughter was born when Lynch was 66, and Stofle 35. “After I had Lula, he disappeared into his work, which is what he does… he works and that’s where he gets his joy,” she tells McKenna.I ask Lynch how he manages to inspire such loyalty, despite such strict rationing of human contact – from his collaborators, friends, even his exes. He drops his cigarette on the floor and stubs it out with a boot before answering. “I like to have some people around. If I was totally alone I think I’d get funny, and not in a humorous way.”As a father and husband he has often been absent, he concedes. “You gotta be selfish. And it’s a terrible thing. I never really wanted to get married, never really wanted to have children. One thing leads to another and there it is.”That sounds like regret, until he elaborates. “I did what I had to do. There could have been more work done. There are always so many interruptions.”• Room To Dream, by David Lynch and Kristine McKenna, is published by Canongate Books at £25.

Cue the loudest cheer of the afternoon.For Lukaku, who ended the game as the tournament’s joint-leading scorer with Cristiano Ronaldo, it was a landmark day. At the age of 25, Lukaku has more goals in major tournaments than any other Belgian and he also became the first player to score two or more in successive World Cup games since Diego Maradona in 1986. Presumably this is what Lukaku had in mind when he said on the eve of the tournament: “I’m going to remember to have fun this time.”Belgium look a team who are having fun full stop. With their slick passing and fluid movement, they are a joy to watch going forward. Lukaku, who is blessed with so much creativity around him, would surely have ended up with a hat-trick had he not been withdrawn with half an hour remaining, after Martínez decided to take no chances with an ankle injury that the Manchester United striker picked up just before the interval.Belgium were 4-1 up by the time Lukaku departed, playing with a swagger and, inspired by the mercurial Hazard, threatening to open up Tunisia every time they ventured into their opponents’ half. Hazard, on this evidence, is determined to show a wider audience why he deserves to be recognised among the most distinguished players in world football. His spot-kick in the fifth minute opened the scoring and there was a touch of class about the way he took his second, expertly sidestepping Farouk Ben Mustapha, the Tunisia goalkeeper, before slotting home. The statistics – 10 goals and 12 assists in his past 20 appearances for Belgium – highlight just how influential Hazard has become to this side.There is, however, quite a supporting cast behind him and Lukaku. Dries Mertens, who scored a splendid goal in the opening game against Panama, set up Lukaku’s first. Thomas Meunier was a rampaging presence on the right, and then there is Kevin De Bruyne, who makes everything tick at the base of the Belgium midfield alongside Axel Witsel.It is a measure of just how free-flowing Belgium were here that Batshuayi, who came on for Hazard, had so many chances during his 22 minutes on the pitch. Youri Tielemans, another substitute, delivered the cross that Batshuayi eventually converted, after seeing one shot cleared off the line, another come back off the bar and Ben Mustapha deny him with a point-blank save.Belgium, in other words, were rampant and it would be fair to say that Tunisia gave them a helping hand with some dreadful defending. To their credit, Tunisia never gave up and they will take some comfort – as may England – from the fact that they managed to score twice against Belgium. Dylan Bronn got the first, before leaving the pitch in tears six minutes later with what appeared to be a serious knee injury, and Wahbi Khazri, impressive throughout, scored the second in injury time.Although Belgium are mathematically not through to the last 16, it would take a bizarre and almost unthinkable set of results for Martínez and his players to miss out on a place in the next phase. Tunisia will be eliminated if Gareth Southgate’s side avoid defeat by Panama on Sunday.The expectation was that Tunisia would try to frustrate Belgium in the same way they did England for long periods but that gameplan went out the window inside six minutes. Syam Ben Youssef made a reckless challenge on Hazard that prompted Jair Marrufo, the referee, to point to the spot. After a slight delay while the video assistant referee checked whether contact was made inside the area, Hazard calmly rolled in his penalty.In the blink of an eye it was 2-0. Mertens, capitalising on a heavy first touch by Ali Maâloul, the Tunisia left-back, carried the ball forward before releasing Lukaku, who steadied himself before shooting low across Ben Mustapha. What followed was not in the script as Tunisia pulled a goal back within two minutes. Khazri delivered an inswinging free-kick that Bronn, who plays his in Belgium for Gent, headed past Thibaut Courtois.Lukaku then restored Belgium’s two-goal advantage on the stroke of half-time with a lovely finish from Meunier’s terrific pass. Ben Mustapha had dashed from his line, trying to narrow the angle, but Lukaku deftly lifted the ball over him. Belgium did not have to wait long for their fourth, which owed much to the vision of Toby Alderweireld, who picked out Hazard’s intelligent run in behind the square Tunisia defence.Then came that flurry of missed chances for Batshuayi, prompting gasps of amazement in the stands, before he finally made it 5-1. Even then Tunisia kept trying to attack, and their admirable perseverance was rewarded when Khazri, who spent last season on loan at Rennes from Sunderland, completed the scoring with a first-time shot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81768ea3d8142726fe842331283188dab9f14ed/713_547_4255_2554/master/4255.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d15359a73f4adab67841b802b30992a2","title":"england panama heat world cup nizhny novgorod gareth southgate repino","story":"• Temperature set to exceed 30C for Panama game on Sunday• England manager chose cool Repino base despite warningsGareth Southgate has defended his decision not to travel sooner to Nizhny Novgorod to help his players acclimatise to the sweltering conditions, with England braced to take the field against Panama in temperatures well in excess of 30C.The Central Americans, used to the heat and humidity of their home country, had travelled to the city 260 miles east of Moscow on Friday as they sought to adjust to new surroundings. Their players, some wearing long sleeves, trained in the stadium at around 3pm – the kick-off time for the Group\u0026nbspG fixture between the teams on Sunday – on Saturday, with England, who have tended not to train in the arena on the eve of competitive games, likely to find the conditions far more\u0026nbspchallenging.It is understood the matter was flagged up within the Football Association, with figures in the set-up suggesting it might make sense to prepare somewhere hotter than Repino, the small seaside resort on the Gulf of Finland where England have made their base. But the management, confident in their plans, are sticking by them.“We never trained at the stadium before any of our World Cup qualifiers,” Southgate said. “It’s fairly\u0026nbsptypical for most of the teams when they play in the Champions League. When I came to the Fifa workshop they were quite keen for teams not to train at the stadia to protect the pitches.“It makes sense to train earlier in the day, recover and then travel. It’s about the flow of the day to leave maximum time for physical recovery. We kick off at 3pm tomorrow, so there’s time ahead of the game. The heat is different in different parts of the country. We have to adapt to that.Southgate’s players trained in conditions closer to 20C at Spartak Zelenogorsk’s stadium before departing for Nizhny Novgorod where the glass-panelled roof on the new stadium, at the confluence of the Volga and Oka rivers, may see temperatures soar into the high 30s at pitch-side. “We’ll have to do the basics really,” said Jordan Henderson, who will again anchor midfield. “Hydration is the most important thing, so plenty of fluids before, during and after the\u0026nbspgame.”England will secure qualification for the knockout phase if they beat Panama, who are competing in their first tournament and are ranked 55 in the world. Ruben Loftus-Cheek is expected to replace the injured Dele Alli in midfield, and Marcus Rashford is also pushing for a first World Cup start, though there remains the possibility Raheem Sterling could be picked as well in a particularly eye-catching selection.Danny Rose is pushing for inclusion at left wing-back and Southgate moved to defuse the furore over the disclosure of Steve Holland’s training notes, which had been caught on camera in Zelenogorsk on Thursday.“I’m really relaxed. Last week the team came out three days before the game and I said nothing about it. I understand it’s something we can’t control and it’s part of being in a tournament and being a big team. There’s no drama about it: the picture the other day wasn’t even the team, so even less of a drama.“On the front sheet at training are always the runners and riders, those that are injured and what the practices will be. Behind that are all the changes we’ll make in the session. I’m totally relaxed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/943eec313baa1db135e72a018f3e3749f69eab0f/0_78_4524_2714/master/4524.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b3ce1bf47f9541f90d8ba4e1ac4df7a","title":"mo salah egypt liverpool ramzan kadyrov chechnya russia world cup","story":"• Liverpool forward presented with order at celebratory dinner• Egyptian FA has been criticised for choice of World Cup baseRamzan Kadyrov has given Mohamed Salah honorary citizenship in Chechnya, taking advantage of the Liverpool forward’s short stay in Russia’s most controversial republic.Egypt’s national team are based in Chechnya for the World Cup despite outrage from rights organisations pointing to the region’s crackdown on political opponents and a widely reported anti-gay pogrom, which Kadyrov has denied.The award came during an honorary banquet held for the Egypt team at Kadyrov’s palace in Grozny, a city he has rebuilt after two devastating wars, with ample support from the Kremlin.“Mohamed Salah is an honorary citizen of the Chechen Republic! That’s right!” the Chechen leader wrote in a post released on social media, saying he had signed an official directive to that effect. “I gave Mohamed Salah a copy of the order and a pin at a celebratory dinner that I gave in honour of the Egyptian team.”Video of the encounter released by the Russian state-funded news agency RT showed Salah smiling as Kadyrov gave a short speech and pinned a badge bearing the Chechen flag to the Liverpool forward’s shirt. Salah was also given a silver plate and a signed jersey from FC\u0026nbspAkhmat Grozny, the football club that Kadyrov renamed in honour of his father last year.It is not clear what Salah thought of all this. He appeared to be playing the role of polite guest, smiling when appropriate and at other times looking over at his team-mates. He did not appear to give a speech at the dinner and has not given public comments since arriving in Chechnya.Kadyrov has angrily denounced reports that he is using Salah’s presence in Grozny to generate good publicity.Speaking to the BBC this week, he said: “Everyone has played here, even Maradona at our stadium, but we don’t use this kind of thing for politics. Our enemies are paid to write things like that. I didn’t invite Mo Salah or the Egyptian team. They chose us themselves.”But Kadyrov has made sure to get several pictures of himself with Salah in public. When the Egyptian footballer skipped the team’s first practice at Akhmat Arena before the tournament, Kadyrov reportedly went to his hotel in order to drive the footballer to the stadium to meet fans and take photographs on the pitch.Photographs of the Chechen leader and Salah were also projected at the banquet dinner, where the Egyptian team clapped politely.The Egyptian Football Association has disregarded criticism over the controversial choice of Chechnya as the team’s base for the World Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/593b45fc60a0b061723f9ead565e34d8a97bb90d/0_153_3099_1859/master/3099.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a782fab639e8298bbdafcfe966e9bd5c","title":"south korea mexico world cup match report","story":"Mexico all but secured safe passage to the last 16 for a seventh successive World Cup after they eased to victory over South Korea in Rostov.Having shocked world champions Germany in their opening Group F game, Mexico secured a 2-1 win as Carlos Vela tucked home a first-half penalty before Javier Hernández clinched the points with his 50th international goal.South Korea, who pulled a goal back in stoppage time through Son Heung-min, are almost certainly out after suffering a second narrow defeat.Although Mexico are set to progress out of Group F, they will be keen to get past the last 16 for the first time since hosting the finals in 1986.“We came to Russia with a lot of criticism but we’re working hard and have a lot of talent. We have humility but we beat Germany and South Korea and now we have to play against Sweden and stay cool and calm,” Hernández said.“We cannot afford to get caught up in all this, we have to continue our job and stay humble, of course we should enjoy this but tomorrow we start working again,” he added after he equalled Luis Hernández’s record of four goals at World Cup finals for Mexico. He looks likely to have at least two more games in Russia to surpass his predecessor.South Korea were guilty of committing a lot of early fouls, Hernández heading wide just after 10 minutes as Mexico looked to take advantage of one of the resulting free kicks.Mexico’s match-winner against Germany, Hirving Lozano, bravely threw his body in front of a Hwang Hee-chan cross as Lee Yong prepared to hammer in a shot at the back-post, hurting himself in the process.Mexico were soon in front. Lozano initially failed to turn home a low cross and Mexico were awarded a penalty as Jang Hyun-soo was penalised for handball – referee Milorad Mazic not needing to use VAR to point to the spot.Vela stepped up and coolly sent Cho Hyun-woo the wrong way to mark his 70th cap with the opening goal.The lead was almost doubled shortly after but Cho was this time equal to Miguel Layún’s long-range strike.The second-half began more equally but it was Cho who was once again called into action just before the hour, neatly tipping a deflected Andrés Guardado effort behind for a corner.Vela angled a curling strike just over the bar before Hernández made sure of the win with a landmark goal.Lozano burst forward as Mexico caught South Korea on the break and he teed up the West Ham striker, who cut inside before scuffing home to double the lead and bring up a half-century of goals for his country in the process.South Korea should have got themselves back into the game as Rafael Márquez’s under-hit back-pass played Son in – but he could not take advantage. Ki Sung-yeung escaped punishment despite catching Guillermo Ochoa with a late challenge as he chased the loose ball.With time running out, Son scored South Korea’s first goal of the finals and it was one worth waiting for as the Tottenham forward bent a 20-yard strike out of the reach of Ochoa and into the corner – but it proved too little, too late.Juan Carlos Osorio’s side now face a final group game against Sweden in Ekaterinburg on Wednesday, while South Korea take on Germany in Kazan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfb5b674c267a7ed098018df204166e12cff4a51/177_0_4641_2785/master/4641.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f851d9f7e0e3eb674a4a72dee2d644a","title":"xhaka and shaqiri goal celebrations bring balkan politics to world cup","story":"Switzerland pair, who have Albanian heritage, inflame tensions with Serbia by making nationalist symbolsThe Serbian Football Association has said it will make a formal complaint to Fifa after Switzerland’s Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri celebrated their goals during a 2-1 World Cup win over Serbia in Kaliningrad by performing an Albanian nationalist symbol.Xhaka and Shaqiri, who are of Albanian-Kosovan heritage but were raised in Switzerland, put their hands together to form what looked like a double-headed eagle similar to the one on the Albanian flag.The gestures risked inflaming political tensions in the Balkans among Serbian nationalists and ethnic Albanians. Kosovo is a former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008. Serbia does not recognise Kosovo’s independence and relations between the two countries remain tense.Shaqiri, who was born in Kosovo, played with the Kosovan flag stitched to one boot and the Swiss flag stitched on the other. Xhaka’s parents are from Kosovo and are of Albanian heritage. The Arsenal midfielder’s father was imprisoned and beaten in the former Yugoslavia for campaigning in favour of Kosovan independence and his brother Taulant plays for Albania’s national team. Jovan Surbatovic, the secretary general of the Serbian FA, said he would write to world football’s governing body regarding “the case of the boots, a question of several controversial flags and the celebration of both goals for Switzerland”. Fifa rules do not directly contemplate punishment for showing a national flag but, according to its disciplinary code, sanctions can be handed out for “provoking the general public”. If found guilty, players can be banned for up to two games. Fifa was approached for comment but has not responded. Xhaka and Shaqiri have suggested their actions were not provocative.“Frankly, my opponents did not interest me at all,” Xhaka said. “It was for my people, who always supported me. For those who did not neglect me, in my homeland, where my parents’ roots are. These were purely emotions.”Shaqiri, who plays for Stoke City, admitted that he was not allowed to talk about “politics” and insisted the celebration was “just emotion”. As he went through the stadium’s mixed zone he grew irritated at the questioning, replying “let’s not talk about this” and walking out when again asked what the significance of the celebration was.“It was a fantastic goal, an important goal for my team and I am very proud I was able to score it for them,” Shaqiri said. “I can’t discuss the gesture I’m afraid. We are footballers, not politicians… Emotions sometimes take over footballers and there was a lot of emotion out there.” He acknowledged it was “a very special game for some players”. Among the Switzerland team that started against Serbia, Valon Behrami is also of Kosovan heritage.Those players had been whistled by a crowd in which it appeared most Russians in the stadium supported Serbia. There were chants of “Serbia-Russia! Serbia-Russia” and a banner declared the two countries “brothers”.After the match, Switzerland’s coach, Vladimir Petkovic, said: “It’s clear that emotions show up and that’s how things happen. I think we all together need to steer away from politics in football and we should focus on this sport as a beautiful game and something that brings people together.” The Serbia manager Mladen Krstajic would not be drawn into the controversy. “I am a man of sports and this is what I am going to stay,” he said. “I have no comment.”The Serbian press officer angrily intervened to prevent what he called “political” questions when Serbia’s Nemanja Matic was asked what he made of the celebration. He threatened to report journalists for doing so.The buildup to the match had seen exchanges between Serbia players and Shaqiri. Aleksandar Mitrovic, who scored Serbia’s goal, asked: “If he loves Kosovo so much and decides to flaunt the flag, why did he refuse a chance to play for their team?” There were a couple of clashes between the pair on the pitch too. At one point, Mitrovic leant forward to say something to Shaqiri when he was on the floor, covering his mouth with his hand as he did so. “I didn’t understand, maybe he spoke Serbian to me,” Shaqiri said. “I had told him already to keep calm and do his job… Of course the Serbian fans were whistling, that’s normal, no? We knew it was going to come but we kept calm. Both teams played with respect and that’s important.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5497f63e0a2771985192aa2375374cb6ccddc4f/0_243_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82eb94fb3ad2f0d29c66119a5c342463","title":"germany v sweden world cup 2018 live","story":"77 min: This result will suit Sweden.

Sweden haven’t had an attack in the second half.63 min: Kroos dummies on the edge of the area to create space for a shot. But his scuffed effort isn’t troubling anyone.61 min: Germany carefully piece an attack together. Kimmich zaps a low ball into the middle and Reus tries to Kanu it in, only to miss the ball completely. Sweden survive. For how much longer?59 min: This is being played like a knockout game. It’s end-to-end, with Germany playing with much more vim and intensity. They don’t have much control but there is a sense they have the quality to create and take a big chance.56 min: Werner, who looks so much better on the left, runs at Sweden again and jabs a cross into the middle. Hector collects and shoots from 12 yards, but Olsen es down to his left to save.52 min: This is frantic. Ekdal picks up a booking for scything down Muller.51 min: Kroos whips the free-kick to the near post and Muller heads just wide.49 min: Germany are up for this now! Kroos pops up on the edge of the area and sees his deflected shot spin just wide. Sweden are panicking. moments later Claesson has to cut out a cross that was destined for Gomez. Then Lindelof concedes a free-kick in a dangerous position on the right. They’re playing like world champions now.Werner runs at Sweden on the left and drives to the byline. He pulls a cross into the six-yard box. Gomez can’t make anything of it but Reus charges in ahead of Augustinsson and knees it past Olsen! Germany have a lifeline!That didn’t take long! Germany are level!47 min: Germany look like they’re playing 4-4-2. They are England.46 min: Off we go again. If it stays like this, Mexico and Sweden will be through to the second round and Germany and South Korea will be out. Mario Gomez has replaced Julian Draxler, who is so disappointing, and joined Timo Werner up front. “What’s got into Die Mannschaft at this World Cup?” Joseph Lam says. “They’re uncharacteristically shaky at the back, today perhaps even more so than against Mexico. I get that today they may be missing the presence of the mighty Mats Hummels, but still, Boateng and Rudiger have been immense all season. And reports of a dressing room rift are distinctly un-German. Right now, teams are doing to Joshua Kimmich as Kimmich did to Marcelo in that Real-Bayern tie this season. Like Real, Germany might need a defensive blundergoalkeeper howler to get back in this one. Mind you, we’ve seen plenty of those this World Cup so far...”Mario Gomez is coming on for Germany.Jerome Boateng has taken a pasting during the half-time analysis on ITV. “Boateng’s walking around like he’s playing Sunday football ,” Roy Keane spits. “He’s been a disgrace. Get him off.” Gary Neville chips in. “Roy is absolutely right, the centre-backs have been a joke. Boateng thinks he’s Beckenbauer. He thinks he’s a player. He’s played under Pep and thinks he’s a fantastic football player. He has been a joke in this first half. He has delusions of grandeur. He’s wandering forward, ambling in the game.”Germany are 45 minutes from first-round elimination from the World Cup for the first time since 1938. Sweden deservedly lead thanks to Ola Toivonen’s smart goal and the holders will be out if they can’t find an equaliser in the second half. That doesn’t look a likely prospect at the moment - Germany have been poor all over the pitch and Sweden have been comfortable since recovering from a nervous start.45 min+2: A free-kick to Sweden on the right. Larsson whips it in and Berg glances a header towards the far corner, only for Neuer to turn it aside! What a huge moment that could turn out to be if Germany turn this around!45 min: Boateng’s shot fizzes wide from 20 yards. There will be two added minutes.44 min: Sweden break down the left, Forsberg leading the charge, Germany all over the place. Forsberg bends a splendid ball into the middle with the outside of his right foot. Toivonen can’t collect it but the ball runs through to Claesson on the right. He should shoot, but he tries to cut inside and loses the chance. What a let-off for Germany - but they were pierced with incredible ease yet again.43 min: Kimmich crosses, Draxler pushes Lustig. The Germany players don’t look happy at all.42 min: Reus hammers a cross into the area. It hits Werner, reminding us of his existence, and Sweden clear. “How will they blame Ozil for this?” Gene Salorio says.39 min: Gundogan lets fly from 25 yards. The shot’s deflected and Olsen has to show magnificent reflexes to adjust his body and e to his right to push the ball out! Muller hurtles on to the loose ball. Lustig turns the ball on to the forward and Olsen springs up to turn the ball wide for a corner!38 min: “The first thing the winner of this World Cup should do is to change the manager in preparation of the next World Cup,” Gokul Kannan says. “Possibly a few players too. The stats cannot be more clear and obvious.”36 min: Kimmich’s cross drifts out of play. Germany look stunned. The Swedish fans are bouncing. “A nationalmannschaffting,” Matt Dony parps.35 min: If it stays like this, Germany are out of the World Cup. That goal hadn’t exactly been coming, but Sweden were growing in confidence and Germany’s attacking threat had rather fizzled out. They don’t look convincing at all. Can they shake their heads clear?This is a fine goal from the Sunderland legend. Germany lose possession again in midfield, Kroos the guilty party, and Sweden attack down the right. Claesson looks up and sees Toivonen in the middle. He picks him out with a lovely cross that cuts out Toivonen, who’s peeled between two Germany defenders. The striker takes the ball on his chest and then lobs it superbly over the onrushing Manuel Neuer with his right foot, perhaps via a slight touch off the covering Rudiger! That is a stunning, impudent finish and Germany are in major bother now! Toni Kroos covers his face with his hand. Manuel Neuer bellows at his team-mates. Can the world champions respond?31 min: Ilkay Gundogan replaces Sebastian Rudy, who remains topless. “It’s the referee’s decision whether or not to heed any VAR advice, and this ref doesn’t seem overly enamoured (going by his previous match too),” says Rob Marriott. “Everyone manning the VAR is also a referee, and almost all referees have spent their entire careers not penalising pullingpushing in the box, so why are they going to change now? VAR is just making it more obvious that a blind eye is being turned.”30 min: It seems that Germany are going to remove Rudy. Blood is still gushing from his nose. I had a nosebleed in the gym yesterday. That’s my Partridgean contribution.29 min: Werner heads the corner away. Rudy still hasn’t returned. He’s still shirtless. Don’t they have another shirt for him? His previous one was covered in blood.28 min: Sweden are enjoying a decent spell of possession. That might be because Rudy is yet to return. Augustinsson ambles down the right and crosses to the far post. Hector heads behind for a corner. “This Germany team’s performance and vibe is more that of a tranquilized snail than a dead frog’s,” Navid Samedi says. “At least frogs look graceful even in death, with their long limbs and shiny skins!”26 min: Blood is streaming from Rudy’s nose. He’s led off the pitch and will presumably return with some heavy bandaging. He had slid in to tackle Toivonen, who inadvertently caught the Germany midfielder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa96e28c42274c2a8ca25f16ef29889082368eb6/0_152_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c6e91ed7402d9701cc96c4f12f62a1c","title":"south korea v mexico world cup 2018 live","story":"Carlos Vela and Javier Hernandez got the goals that sent Mexico top of Group F with maximum points after two gamesHere’s our report on how it all went down at the Rostov Arena, where Mexico made it two wins out of two.Six points from two games for Mexico: Goals from Carlos Veal and Javier Hernandez were enough to take all three points from South Korea, who didn’t play terribly but were fairly toothless up front. Son scored a fine late consolation goal, but was left isolated up front on his own in team that seemed bereft of ideas.Mark the players out of 10 here and remember that sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind.Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep!!!! It’s all over and despite the late scare, Mexico hang on to make it two wins from two in Group F. Meanwhile at the Fisht Stadium, Germany are preparing to play Sweden and will exit the tournament if they lose.90+4 min: That was a wonderful goal from Son, who picked up the ball on the edge of the Mexico penalty area, cut inside and unleashed a venomous left-footed drive that screamed in at the far post. Too little, too late, perhaps. But one for the show-reel.Crikey! What a strike from Son. A fabulous dipping shot from outside the Mexico penalty area fizzes past the despairing e of Ochoa.90+2 min: Mexico free-kick, wide on the left. Corona swings the ball into the mixer but Cho claims.89 min: As tens of thousands of sombrero-sporting Mexicans celebrate in the stands, their team attempt to close out the game to make it two wins and clean sheets from two games. They haven’t impressed as much today as they did against Germany, but they’ll be delighted with this result. 87 min: Son picks up the ball in midfield, powers forward and tries a shot from distance. His effort sails high over the bar. The Spurs forward has worked extremely hard across both games for South Korea, but has had a World Cup to forget thus far.85 min: Mexico right-back Edson Alvarez is suffering badly from cramp, but his manager has used all his substitutes, so he’s forced to soldier on. On the subject of soldiering on, South Korea’s most recent substitute, Hong, is currently doing his military service which makes this World Cup something of a Tour of Duty.84 min: South Korea substitution: Hong Chi on for Kim Min-yoo. 83 min: Javier Hernandez’s goal was his 50th for Mexico, in case you’re interested. This is his 104th appearance for his country.80 min: Moments after coming on as a substitute, Jung woo-young is booked for catching Javier Hernandez with an elbow as he tries to shield the ball from the Mexican. 78 min: Mexico substitution: Dos Santos on for Vela. South Korea substitution: Jung Woo-young on for Moon.74 min: With their hopes of advancing to the knockout stages evaporating in the Rostov sunshine, South Korea plug on. A ludicrous back-pass from Marquez almost puts Son in one-on-one with the goalkeeper, but he squanders a glorious opportunity to take the ball around Ochoa and chooses instead to try and score with a fancy back-flick. In the ensuing scramble, Ki catches Ochoa with an accidental boot. Mexico got away with one there.73 min: Mexican substitution: Hirving Lozano off for Jesus Corona. 72 min: Lee Seung-woo is booked for a foul on Miguel Layun.69 min: Mexico substitution: Rafael Marquez on for Andres Guardado. Fun fact: at his fifth World Cup, the Mexican skipper is currently blacklisted by the US Treasury as he’s suspected of laundering money for a Mexican drugs cartel.67 min: Mexico broke with a three-on-three and Lozano on the ball. He had two options and chose to pass to Hernandez on his left. Hernandez shaped to shoot with his left foot, before checking inside as a fully committed Jang slid past him. Hernandez then had the relatively straightforward task of slotting the ball past Cho from about six yards.Javier Hernandez scores to wrap up a fine breakaway move for Mexico.63 min: South Korea right-back Lee Yong gets booked for leaving one in on Hirving Lozano, who’s getting a right kicking in this match.62 min: Entertaining, end-to-end stuff as Carlos Vela tries his luck with a curled effort from distance. It’s a little too high and floats narrowly wide. 61 min: Lee Jae-sung has a goal-bound shot blocked by Salcedo after being teed up by a Son cross from the left. 60 min: Lozano looks to be through on goal with only Cho to beat after picking up a ball from deep from Guardado, but is foiled by a last-ditch tackle from Hwang. 59 min: Cho es to his left to bat away an Andres Hernandez rasper that looked to be going in past the upright. A good effort from the Mexican foiled by a decent save. Nothing comes from the resulting Mexico corner.58 min: Kim Young-gwon is booked for a completely unnecessary foul on Vela near the halfway line. 56 min: Ki brings a smart save out of Ochoa with a long range curler from the left. It’s a powerful effort which the goalkeeper can only parry on his first attempt, before grabbing the ball on his second. 55 min: Guardado’s delivery from the free-kick is poor and Cho plucks the ball from the air. 54 min: Lozano goes to ground holding his shin after being fouled by Ju. Free-kick for Mexico, several yards outside the South Korea penalty area.53 min: Moon tries a shot, which hits the arm of Carlos Salcedo, who is in the Mexico penalty area. South Korea appeal for a penalty, but don’t get one. For the benefit of pedants, Salcedo’s arm was bent at a 90 degree angle and by his side.52 min: Now Javier Hernandez unleashes a shot from distance. It too sails over the bar. Lozano was making a clever run in behind the South Korea defence which Hernandez failed to spot.50 min: Hirving Lozano cuts inside to the edge of the South Korea penalty area and unleashes a right-footed shot. His effort soars high over the bar.49 min: A very scrappy opening few minutes to this second half, which has been punctuated by lots of throw-ins. 47 min: Throw-in for Mexico, deep inside their own half. They go on to win another one, 20 metres further up the pitch. 46 min: Play resumes with no changes on either side. More on that penalty: “Whatever the rights and wrongs of the decision, the Sth Korean players didn’t put up any fight about it,” writes Aidy Griffin. “They seemed to accept it meekly, which suggests they agreed with the ref, or at a minimum didn’t feel any protests would be heard.” This is true. The players go off for their half-time oranges with Mexico leading courtesy of a Carlos Vela penalty. South Korea are still in with a shout, but haven’t posed Mexico too many problems so far.45+1 min: “Korean defender’s arm straight up in the air, classic case of an unnatural position,” says Richard McGahey. “You can’t raise your arm up in the air and let the ball strike it and then say you didn’t move your arm. Imagine if players did that on a direct free kick in the wall, would you say it was ok, because they didn’t move their arms? Same principle.”It really isn’t the same principle. Standing in a wall is a lot different to ing at full speed, on the stretch, to block a cross.42 min: “In no way was that a harsh penalty,” writers David Sweet. “Defender went to ground, in your words, to intercept the cross. He was therefore deliberately putting himself in the way of the cross and the fact that his hand was in the air was clearly to improve his chances of intercepting the cross. Handball is playing the ball with the hand. He was playing for that, hoping that if it hit his hand he would get away with it.”I’d say his hand was in the air because he was ing in to intercept a cross and footballers generally tend to do so with outstretched arms. I know they’re playing in Rostov, the home of the Cossacks, but folding them probably wasn’t an option. Lozano, who is proving a real handful, shoots over the bar for Mexico.39 min: Hark at me. As I type, South Korea hoof it long to Son, who darts in behind Alvarez and Salcedo to chase Moon’s delivery. He gets on the ball near the byline, but Ochea is quickly off his line to smother the ball at Son’s feet. Those long balls over the top to Son have got Mexico in trouble twice now - they need to try it more often.38 min: Much like in their opening game against Sweden, South Korea are looking very toothless up front. They enjoy keeping possession, but are struggling to do anything with it. Apart from that time Son got in behind Salcedo and Moreno, he’s done very little.36 min: Herrera picks out Layun on the right wing with a wonderful long diagonal pass and the winger’s first touch is perfect. He controls the ball instantly and sends in a cross towards Lozano. South Korea clear.35 min: Lee returns to action after treatment. He looked to have damaged his ribcage after a tussle with Jesus Gallardo. 34 min: Lee Yong goes down injured and requires treatment, allowing the rest of the players on the field to take drinks on board. It’s a sweltering day in Rostov.

It isn’t the process of getting pregnant, with its cycles of raised and dashed hopes, or the term “sperm donor”, with its unsettling connotations. It’s not even the queasy feeling that what you are doing sets you apart from other people and that the reason you are doing it is not that you are a powerful, rational, resourceful woman, but, as a friend of mine put it after considering and rejecting the idea of having a baby alone, that “I couldn’t get anyone to shag me”.No. The hardest thing about having a baby alone is making the decision to do it.“So are you going to do it then?” says Rosemary. It is late summer 2013 and we are drinking whisky in a hotel bar in Edinburgh. “Yeah, probably,” I say. “I mean, I might. Are you?”I haven’t seen Rosemary for months and it is only after a lot of whisky, and with a casualness that belies the cold terror underneath, that we reach the main order of business: our ongoing discussion, part lament, part spur to action, over what to do about having children. That is: if, when, how and with whom, or, since we are both, for the purposes of this conversation, single, “with” “whom”.I have always known I wanted children. From the time I was old enough to conceptualise my future, motherhood made sense to me. It was always one child in my imaginings and never part of a fantasy about marriage, and while everything else in my life changed over the years – the country I lived in, the kind of work I did, the gender of the people I dated – the distant outline of a child remained steadfast. On the rare occasions I allowed myself to inspect it directly, the idea that it might never happen made me feel giddy with loss.I met L two years after moving to New York. On the surface of things, we looked very different – me, English, lefty, fundamentally unkempt she, New Yorker, centre-right, well put together. On any given day we could disagree about everything – fact or fiction, subway or car, Republican or Democrat – so that, in the months after we met, it felt like being on safari in each other’s alien worlds. If falling in love is, partly, a question of finding a docking station for one’s neuroses, I knew I was home when L told me that, after her building was evacuated during 911, she went straight to an off-licence and bought hundreds of dollars’ worth of booze in case civilisation collapsed and the world reverted to a barter economy. Come the zombie apocalypse, this is a woman you want on your side. But there was this, too: the house she grew up in would one day have to be sold, she said, and what she would miss most were the things you can’t take with you, like the sound the stairs made when they expanded at night. Somewhere in my system, a pilot light flared.She was three years older than me and told me from the outset that, in the near future, she was planning on trying to get pregnant. Logistically, this made sense it would be madness to forestall while we flapped about for another two years trying to decide what we were doing. Emotionally, however, it stumped me. According to every relationship model I knew, you could either be with someone who’d had kids before you met, have kids together and separate down the line, or split up and have a baby alone. There was no such thing as being with someone who had a baby on her own. It sounded like a terrible deal: all the stress and anxiety without the substance of motherhood.At that stage, the strongest terms in which I could have put my own long-held but dormant desire for a baby were that I didn’t want not to have one. If there was, behind this impulse, a larger, less tangible longing, I didn’t want to look into it too deeply lest it unleash a full-blown baby hunger I couldn’t get back in the box. But I started to notice small, unsettling changes in myself. When somebody asked me, “Do you have children?” – a question that, until recently, I had responded to in my head with versions of, “Are you mental? I’m about 11” – it started to sound less neutral, more unfriendly. I had always believed that, medical issues aside, most women without children had acted through choice, but my faith in this weakened. I watched as a number of friends missed out on having children because their boyfriends broke up with them when they were in the vicinity of 40, before having children with younger women. I watched as women six, seven years my senior finally met someone new and went through round after punishing round of IVF. I didn’t want to be alone at 45, or 50, and on Tinder, dating people with children when I had none of my own. I didn’t want to be 70, the age my mother was when she died, lying on my deathbed without the image of my child’s face in my head. Above all, I didn’t want to look back on this period and wish I’d had the courage to act.I also didn’t want to “help” another woman raise her baby. Unless I was Mother Teresa (I’m not), the only way it would make sense for me to stick around in the event of L having a child was if our relationship became a more conventional union, or if I had my own baby independently, too.It’s not that L’s pregnancy made me more broody (I defy any woman to see another woman’s early pregnancy up close and think, “Hey, that looks fun!”) and I wasn’t bound by her decisions. We didn’t live together. In fact, an infantile strand of my personality deliberately wanted to make different decisions. If we were going to suffer the deprivations of single parenthood, we might as well realise all the advantages, too – in my case, starting from scratch and doing precisely what suited me and my notional baby.All I had to do was figure out what that was. Would I use a friend as a sperm donor, or a stranger? If the former, who? If the latter, how would I make that choice? Would I move back to London for free treatment on the NHS (which, to the horror of the rightwing press, now offers fertility services to single women and lesbians) or stay in America and spend thousands on something that might not even work? In the event, I choose the path of least resistance: America will never really feel like home, but it is where I live, where L has her baby and where, eight months later, I am sufficiently panicked to finally get moving with my own.One of the things you have to get used to when you are a British person embarking on fertility treatment in the US is the pace. In Britain, the law of supply and demand is such that there are more women wanting sperm than there are donors, so even private clinics have waiting lists. In America, where no one with adequate resources waits for anything, you have a chat with your doctor, schedule a date, call the donor bank, which bikes the sperm round to the clinic, and off you go. You might have spent six months or six years deciding to do this but you could, potentially, be pregnant within a month of first seeing your doctor.That is, if you have made what feels at the time like the hardest decision: how to pick a donor. This question probably cost me six months of concentrated flapping, during which time I asked a male friend if he’d do it, because it seemed more “normal” than the alternatives, and was achingly relieved when he said no, before eventually deciding to find an anonymous donor.This is a tricky part of the story for me. There may come a day when it is as regular as milk to share details of one’s sperm donor – when there is a language less alienating to describe it than this, and that feels less compromising of one’s child’s privacy. But we are not there yet, and I’ve no idea how to calibrate this choice. Is it the biggest of my life, or essentially meaningless? Underplay the donor and you risk turning the guy into the elephant in the room go on about him too much and you risk pathologising your child’s background. Scrolling through profiles, I look for characteristics that align with my own. I want someone clever, which here means educated. I want someone with dark hair. I want someone whose favourite film isn’t Once Upon A Time In America or Titanic. In the absence of a metric for gauging a man’s humour or internal beauty or moral worth, I want someone tall and basically symmetrical. A choice is superficial only if it is made at the expense of deeper considerations and so, although I reject sperm donors on criteria that would outrage me if applied in real life by men to women, I tell myself I’m not doing anything wrong.Everything is extra: $35 for the guy’s baby photos $50 for an audio file. Guidelines vary, but in New York you can see photos of him only as a child. Some donor banks offer a “silhouette” of him as an adult, which would be hilarious if it weren’t so creepy. What next – his breath in a jar to rule out halitosis? I don’t listen to the audio files. I don’t try to find the guy, even though there is so much information, it would probably take me less than a day. This is not gene selection it is the selection of the story of how my child came to be, and, through a combination of vital statistics, familiarity of background, a subtle implication that he is a Democrat and his use of the word “tremendous”, which signals to me a certain wryness and enthusiasm, I make my choice. In other words, on nothing substantive. What matters is it’s my choice and I make it.I pay extra for ID disclosure, enabling any child to trace the donor when they turn 18. I decide how much to buy – enough for three cycles – then fill in a form and return it, along with payment for almost $2,000. When I call to confirm my request, I half expect the receptionist to laugh and ask what on earth am I doing, trying to buy genetic material over the phone as if it were lunch? Instead, after I mumble, “Need to order some sperm”, she puts me through to the lab, where a technician will check to see if what I want is available.I give him the donor number. There is a clacking of keys, followed by a short pause. Then, with the smoothness of a sommelier fielding a wine order at dinner, he says, “An excellent choice.”After weeks of monitoring, at the end of 2013, my eggs are ready. This is it, says Dr B. I can come in tomorrow and, after waiting an hour for the sperm to defrost, finally get this show on the road. He asks if I’d like L to be present when the insemination takes place. “Some people find it nice to involve their partners.”Fertility treatment can be hard and excluding, he says, and involving the patient’s partner, even to the extent of inviting him or her to operate the syringe full of sperm, can give them a feeling of inclusion. I blush. Clearly he’s in favour of L being present, either because it gives him a warm feeling or to neutralise some latent ambivalence he has about helping to create single mothers.I try to imagine the scene: me, stressed out and half-naked on a gurney L, holding the catheter and rolling her eyes the medical staff, trying not to intrude on our beautiful moment. I don’t think I want L there – I don’t want anyone there, it’s embarrassing – and when I imagine asking her, I realise I don’t want to give her an opportunity to say no, either.There is a cold, mean streak in me that makes me think trying to involve the partner is ludicrous under any circumstances. Surely there’s a dignity in allowing things to be what they are? This is a medical procedure pretending otherwise risks making the treatment seem sadder, just as choosing a sperm donor will continue to feel sad, or bad, or weird, as long as it’s tied to conventions associated with choosing a spouse.The next day, a week before Christmas, Dr B breezes in full of good cheer. We chit-chat as he loads the syringe with a substance that is, gram for gram, more expensive than the world’s finest heroin (though less expensive than marrying someone you’re not into in order to have a baby).The cycle fails, as do the subsequent three cycles, one of which results in a short-lived pregnancy and all of which mean that, by the spring of 2014, I am taking, for the second month in a row and despite producing too many eggs the first time, large amounts of fertility hormones.It is different this time.“How do you feel?” says Dr B.For five days I have been injecting myself with a preloaded pen, which has bruised me terribly. The skin of my abdomen looks like 1970s wallpaper, all bright purple flowers with a greeny blue border. I feel altered, hideously bad-tempered. I tell myself it’s chemical and will pass. But it doesn’t. A week after finishing the injections, Dr B looks at my charts and tells me to stop taking the drugs. Ten days later I go in for insemination number five.“Whoa,” says the nurse doing the ultrasound. “You’ve a lot going on in there.”I look at the screen: a lot of shapeless dark patches connected by strings.“They look like spider’s eggs,” I say, and shudder.I have, once again, overreacted to the hormones. But Dr B says not to worry: not all of them are mature. I could call off the cycle but I say, “Go ahead.” The sun comes out that weekend, and L and I take a walk with the baby in the buggy. I feel Zen in the face of all possible outcomes. On Monday night I go into my kitchen and crack an egg against the side of a pan for dinner. Two bright yellow yolks slide down. I have never seen such a thing before and stare down at the eggs, feeling bad for the hen. I am so surprised I say it out loud: “Twins.”It’s twins. Of course it is. How could it not be? I am a walking exemplar of the phrase, “Be careful what you wish for.” Over the next few weeks I wait for the idea of carrying twins to normalise, but it doesn’t. For minutes at a time I forget I’m pregnant, then I remember with the force of the original shock. I have lunch with an old friend I haven’t seen for a while. I know he’ll be shocked, too, and he is.“How’s that going to work?” he says.And there it is, the question we’ve been avoiding since L’s pregnancy. If I have these babies, what will the babies be to L and what will she be to them? The answer is only partly to be found in the relationship I have with her baby. There is no honorific to describe what I am to him and there is no word for what he is to me. He is at the centre of us, the miracle over whom we both marvel, but I have no moral, financial or legal responsibility for him. Neither do I perform many of the most basic parental duties. I have always known this lopsided arrangement would be tolerable only until I had a baby of my own. What I hadn’t anticipated is the ways in which its limitations would also prove to be strengths. In the year since his birth, my relationship with the baby has evolved to be oddly free-floating from that with L. He is my buddy, a child in whom I have no stake other than love. That it’s a love I’m not bound – by law or biology – to feel makes it all the more precious.On the other hand, what am I doing potentially bringing two further children into a situation it takes so long to explain? I can just about rationalise to myself why a woman without a child might want to maintain a degree of separation from a partner with a child, given the vast difference in lifestyle. But two women in separate households with babies of a similar age who hang out on evenings and weekends? If we’re not a blended family, then what on earth are we? Clearly, at this point, the proper course of action would be to either give up this nonsense of separate households and separate children, and move in together, or else call it a day. There is no middle way. Perhaps it is selfish. It’s selfish to carry on along parallel tracks, denying the children a second parent and creating two single-parent families. It’s selfish, practically, morally, financially and environmentally, to maintain our independence while being together, like driving two cars to a single destination. And while my relationship with L’s baby is full of joy, how can it survive once I have my own children and am unable to travel back and forth to see him?For the first time I seriously question why I want to do this alone. It isn’t just that L and I have conflicting ideas about parenting – very broadly, I am too mean in her eyes, and she isn’t mean enough in mine – it’s the historical weight each of us puts on those differences and our assumptions about where they might lead us. We both have a highly developed sense of self-preservation, which expresses itself in different ways, except, perhaps, in this one shared belief: that the way one protects children from harm is by controlling who has access to them. The only thing more frightening to me than not having a baby is having a baby in a hostile environment. One afternoon L sends me an email with a link to an apartment listing that is almost double the rent I pay in Brooklyn. The floor plan looks familiar, as does the view from the window. It’s in her building, the mirror image of her home, but one floor down.“?!” I reply.“But do we want to live that close to each other? Isn’t it weird?”I go to see it. The landlord is putting in new flooring and a new bathroom and most of the apartment is under polythene, but because it’s an exact copy of L’s, bar the fixtures and fittings, I don’t have much trouble imagining it. It occurs to me, as I walk around, that he may not even want to rent to a single woman expecting two babies. But in any case, it’s too expensive. Eeven if it’s the kind of building I need, with a mail room and an elevator and a maintenance team on site even if it would be amazing to have L upstairs when I bring the babies home even if the very fact that the listing came up in the first place, in a co-op that discourages rentals, is the kind of coincidence that feels like a gift from above – none of that matters, because I can’t afford it.It is, surely, nuts: to sort of live together but not. It feels like cheating, to have L’s support and proximity without the hard work of cohabitation. How would we explain it to the children? Or to ourselves? That we like each other sufficiently to be in daily contact, except on days when we don’t? What would the kids even be to each other? Cousins? Best friends? The victims of a half-arsed piece of emotional evasion, or beneficiaries of a radical new vision?In those first weeks after moving, we enter a honeymoon period in which the loveliness of living almost together is nothing to the luxury of living sort of apart. The act of leaving my flat and walking up one flight imbues daily visits with the tiny frisson of occasion. When one of us snaps, the other goes home without it being construed as a histrionic gesture. There’s no marriage or joint mortgage, but a commitment has been made. I have the long-overdue realisation that relationships rely on a balance between independence and the right level of curtailment of freedom to liberate one from the burden of choice.One evening, L sits on the sofa with her son, reading a book about different kinds of families. “‘Some people have two mommies,’” she reads, pointing to an illustration of two badgers wearing earrings with a baby badger in their midst. “‘Some people have two daddies. Some people have one mummy, hasome people have one daddy.’” Her baby, who isn’t a baby any more but a toddler and the most delightful child in the world, isn’t quite old enough to formulate questions and we are off the hook for a little while yet. L and I exchange glances. “Some people have a neighbour,” she says, sotto voce.My final ultrasound of the year falls just after Christmas. I am six weeks from the due date. The technician looks at the screen. He frowns, says something I don’t catch and leaves the room. Someone else comes in. Everyone gathers by the monitor while I look at the ceiling and try to figure out what to have for lunch. A fourth doctor comes in and tells me to get dressed and follow him. I feel a spike of alarm. In his office, my high-risk obstetrician, Dr Y, is waiting.“They have to come out,” Dr Y says.“Oh my God.”The placenta for the smallest baby is working only intermittently if it stops altogether, she’ll die.“This is not an emergency,” Dr Y says calmly, “but it is… fairly urgent.” He tells me he has time the following day, New Year’s Eve, or the day after that.“Let’s do it tomorrow,” I say, trembling.My dad is in London and offers to come straight to New York, but I don’t want him in the air while I’m having surgery I can’t add fear of his plane going down to everything else. At L’s that night, I tell her to ask her mother to come across town the following day to watch her son.“I’m so happy you’ll be there,” I say.“It’s only because everyone else is in England.”“No, it isn’t. I would want you to be there, whatever.”As I say this, I realise it’s true. Fear pushes me inward, joy pushes me out, and while I am as frightened of having these babies as of anything, it’s a different kind of fear: not a shrinking but an opening out. I have been so stringent in ensuring I can do this alone, perhaps the reward is that I don’t always have to.Right up until the last moment, a small part of me thinks, what if all this is a mistake? What if Dr Y turns to me and says there’s nothing in there – of course you’re not pregnant! Did you think that, by signing a few forms and handing over your credit card, you could dodge millennia of evolution, not to mention convention and common decency? Go home, buy yourself a cat and never speak of this again.But at 4.17 pm the next day, a tiny, fierce cry fills the room. Baby A is removed from the basement of my body. I burst into tears. L grips my hand. A moment later, Baby B comes out and L leaps from her seat in the direction of the babies while Dr Y, turning to his students, holds a quick pop quiz over my guts. Then the nurses bring over the babies.L gets all of this illegally on camera. It’s not footage I can watch too often. The babies, two flat-faced Glo Worms covered in gel, are blotchy and impossibly alive. I am insane on the gurney, grinning drunkenly at my two girls. Over and over I say it, in the manner of a woman shortly to be given more drugs: “Oh my God, I can’t believe they’re both blond.”• This is an edited extract from An Excellent Choice by Emma Brockes, published by Faber \u0026amp Faber at £16.99.

Luckily, there are as many ways to cook courgettes as there are courgettes in Greece, and each has a different effect: maximise courgettes’ freshness by serving them raw, marinated, pickled or grilled or roast or slow-cook for a creamier result. This akopita-like filo pie, in which I swap the usual spinach for courgette, is a nod to happy summers in the Mediterranean sun.I’ve added cheddar to what is otherwise a straightforward Greek pie, because I find it ties everything together nicely, but feel free to use another cheese, if you prefer.1kg courgettes (about 6), trimmed and gratedSalt and black pepper20g dill, roughly chopped20g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped20g parsley leaves, roughly chopped4-6 spring onions, thinly sliced (60g)2 eggs, beaten150g feta, roughly crumbled80g mature cheddar, coarsely grated½ tsp chilli flakes2 tsp lemon zest, finely grated40ml olive oil175g filo pastry (ie, 7 39cm x 30cm sheets)½ tsp nigella seedsHeat the oven to 170C335Fgas 3. Mix the grated courgettes and two teaspoons of salt in a large bowl, then tip into a sieve and leave to drain for 30 minutes.Wrap the courgettes in batches in a clean tea towel and wring tightly, to extract as much liquid as possible – you should end up with about 520g courgette flesh. Transfer to a large bowl and add the herbs, onions, eggs, both cheeses, chilli, lemon zest, half a teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of black pepper.Line the base of a 23cm spring-form cake tin with greaseproof paper and lightly grease the sides with oil. Lay a sheet of filo over the base, allowing the excess to hang over the sides of the tin, and brush with oil. Top with another piece of filo, rotating it slightly so the excess hangs at a different angle, brush with oil, then repeat three more times, until you have used up five sheets in all. Put the courgette filling in the centre of the pie and even it out with a spoon. Brush another piece of filo with oil, fold it in half horizontally and lay it over the filling, tucking in any excess around the filling. Brush with oil, then repeat with the last sheet of filo, angling it to cover any exposed filling. Fold over the overhanging filo, crinkling it up to leave a crumpled top, brush with more oil and sprinkle with the nigella seeds.Transfer the tin to an oven tray and bake for 50 minutes. Take out of the oven, remove the outer ring of the tin, and bake for 15 minutes more, until golden and cooked through. Leave to cool for about 20 minutes before serving.This is a standalone vegetarian main course that I return to time and again. The semolina porridge is like runny polenta, only a little creamier. You can substitute it with rice or mashed potato, if you like.50g unsalted butter5 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced1.2kg large courgettes (ie, about 6-7), trimmed, cut in half lengthways, then thinly sliced widthways Salt and black pepper200g frozen peas, defrosted25g basil leaves, roughly shredded15g tarragon leavesFinely grated zest of 1 lemon50g pine nuts, lightly toasted1 tbsp olive oil, to serveFor the semolina porridge600g whole milk180g semolina100g pecorino, finely shavedPut the butter in a large saute pan for which you have a lid, and put it on a medium-high heat. Once the butter has melted, add the garlic and fry for a minute or two, until it starts to brown.Add the courgettes, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for five minutes, stirring often, until the courgettes start to soften. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and leave to cook for five minutes. Stir in the peas and warm through for a minute, until the peas are cooked, then take off the heat, stir in the herbs and lemon zest, and set aside while you make the porridge.Put the milk and 600ml water in a medium saucepan, and add three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of pepper. Bring to a boil on a medium-high heat, then add the semolina and whisk continuously for three to four minutes, until smooth and thick, like porridge. Turn off the heat and stir in 80g of the pecorino.Divide the porridge between shallow bowls and top with the courgettes and peas. Finish with the pine nuts, a sprinkling of the remaining pecorino and a drizzle of oil.This needs to be dished up the moment its made, before the courgettes start ‘weeping’ and losing their freshness, so don’t let it sit around for too long. It goes well with meat from the grill or alongside a bunch of meze.3 tbsp olive oil10g thyme sprigs1 lemon – peel finely shaved into 6 strips (avoid the bitter white pith), then juiced, to get 2 tbsp1 garlic clove, smashed with the flat side of a knife600g courgettes (a mix of green and yellow looks great, if you can find both), trimmed and shaved into long, thin ribbons with a potato peeler or mandoline60g walnut halves, roughly choppedSalt and black pepper15g basil, roughly shreddedPut the oil, thyme, lemon peel and garlic in a small saucepan on a low heat and leave to infuse for eight minutes, until the oil becomes aromatic and the garlic, lemon and thyme start to colour.

Pick the leaves off the sprigs and add to the oil discard the sprigs, lemon and garlic.Put the courgettes, walnuts, lemon juice, a third of a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper into the oil, then massage the courgettes for a minute or so – they will break up a little – then stir in the basil and serve at once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ef6fe4450a7e99b3a72f4e7ea3552214cf10b3/0_153_2799_1679/master/2799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5c23e9345f63d34c0f2c02fb7b9c098","title":"from medical discharge to the london marathon one military couples story of resilience","story":"When Mike Kiff was discharged from the army, chronic pain and depression threatened to end his marriage, but with support from The Royal British Legion he and his wife have rebuilt their life togetherIn 2005, Cpl Mike Kiff fell from a roof and dislocated his shoulder badly while on active duty. The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cabcc8d37a79b853e89f5857d27a29c9a678333c/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07d1af13bfd4fd36439111876db5a0cc","title":"netflix chief of communications leaving after reports of using n word","story":"Reed Hastings vows to ‘set a better example’ in memo regretting PR chief’s racial slurThe head of Netflix has told his staff he needs to “set a better example” after sacking the company’s head of communications for twice using the N-word during work meetings.Reed Hastings, the video streaming company’s founder, told staff in a memo he had decided to “let go” of Jonathan Friedland for using the racial slur in a “descriptive” sense. Friedland, a former journalist who joined Netflix in 2011, first used the word several months ago during a discussion about offensive words in comedy, and again a few days later during a conversation with two black colleagues. Hastings, who became a billionaire after starting Netflix as a mail-order DVD rental company in 1997, said in the lengthy memo, published by the Hollywood Reporter, that he heard about the second incident last week.Friedland tweeted an apology: “Leaders have to be beyond reproach in the example we set and unfortunately I fell short of that standard when I was insensitive in speaking to my team about words that offend in comedy. I feel awful about the distress this lapse caused to people at a company I love and where I want everyone to feel included and appreciated.”Friedland spent 20 years as a foreign correspondent before joining the Walt Disney Company. During his seven years at Netflix, it has become a dominant force online, valued at £106bn, with 125 million subscribers worldwide.The memo from Hastings said Friedland had “contributed greatly in many areas”, but showed “unacceptably low racial awareness and sensitivity”.“Several people afterwards told him how inappropriate and hurtful his use of the N-word was, and Jonathan apologised to those that had been in the meeting. We hoped this was an awful anomaly never to be repeated.”Of the second incident, Hastings wrote: “Jonathan said the N-word again to two of our black employees in HR who were trying to help him deal with the original offence. The second incident confirmed a deep lack of understanding, and convinced me to let Jonathan go now.”Hastings said global debate and the word’s use in film and music had created some confusion about whether using it could ever be acceptable. “For non-black people, the word should not be spoken as there is almost no context in which it is appropriate or constructive (even when singing a song or reading a script),” Hastings wrote.“There is not a way to neutralise the emotion and history behind the word in any context. The use of the phrase ‘N-word’ was created as a euphemism, and the norm, with the intention of providing an acceptable replacement and moving people away from using the specific word. When a person violates this norm, it creates resentment, intense frustration, and great offence for many.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b31ed89e9466c053ae312839e1d04acf3cab91a/0_73_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2212f62687ac9cfc72591fd945514410","title":"david byrne american utopia tour hammersmith apollo review","story":"One strand of western thought still assumes that the mind and the body are distinct. To generalise, dance music is for bodies while art rock, say, titillates the mind.David Byrne begins each night on the highly unorthodox tour for his most recent album, American Utopia, seated at a table stroking a brain – like a memento mori, only pinker. It is the only splash of colour on a grey, bare stage, encircled by shimmering beaded curtains. So far, so cerebral: the song is Here, from the new album, and its lyrics describe sections of the cerebellum.Byrne was, of course, once the frontman of a band called Talking Heads (and not, say, Grinding Hips), whose anxious, querying post-punk appealed to lateral thinkers. In the magnificent 2017 film, 20th Century Women, set in 1979, the band are referred to as “art fags”. Another film – the 1984 documentary, Stop Making Sense, about Talking Heads’ concept-heavy Speaking in Tongues tour – set an artistic benchmark so high few other films about music have ever come close.This tour is an artistic endeavour not far off Stop Making Sense’s high-water mark. Byrne’s youthful air of surprise has given way in recent years to a more professorial demeanour, to which he has recently added a foppish Andy Warhol haircut.But one of the secrets of Byrne’s early success, mid-period extemporisations and absolute continued relevance is his devotion to rhythm. Byrne explained his choice of Stop Making Sense’s outsized suit to an interviewer at the time as a device to make his head appear smaller. “Because music is very physical, and often the body understands it before the head.”This unprecedented, exquisite live show finds a 12-strong band in near-constant motion, with percussion to the fore: at several points, half a dozen musicians are playing bits of drum kits hanging off harnesses they are wearing, a cross between an American high school marching band and a Brazilian carnival procession. (The harnesses are so discreet, the keyboard player’s instrument appears to hover in mid-air.) Everyone is in (normal-sized) grey Kenzo suits and barefoot by the end, backing vocalist Chris Giarmo’s jacket is entirely black at the back, and Byrne’s own back is piebald with sweat. There are moments where Byrne gnomically ruches up his trouser leg to reveal an ankle, or rolls up his jacket sleeve to reveal an inner elbow. At the end of a lot of songs, he hoicks up his trousers – since the tour began, you can imagine Byrne has shed the odd pound.Pop is no stranger to troupe dancing, but working musicians don’t normally move this perfectly, rearranging themselves like psychic starlings into clumps or lines, posing, vogue-ing, proceeding backwards in circles choreographer Annie-B Parson is the architect of these manoeuvres. You can see the link to a previous Byrne outing – 2015’s US-only Contemporary Colour shows, since released as a film – which found Byrne reinterpreting the US sports pastime known as “colour guard”, where flag-spinners join marching bands for half-time performances.This set, by contrast, is all grey and minimal and yet somehow just as kaleidoscopic. A huge swath of songs – Talking Heads songs, Byrne solo outings drawn from various periods, covers, collaborations – have all been subtly rescored to fit a show heavy on funk, fun, drama, shadowplay and a sprinkling of overt politics. Between two recent songs – Dog’s Mind and Everybody’s Coming to My House – Byrne encourages everyone to vote “in every election they possibly can”. The second encore finds the band covering Janelle Monáe’s 2015 anthem Hell You Talmbout, which lists the names of young African Americans killed by law enforcement or other violent confrontations.The old Talking Heads favourites are pure pleasure, ning moods as erse as I Zimbra, This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody) and a frankly magnificent version of Once in a Lifetime, which Byrne announces by staggering around, spotlit, quoting his own former movements.Although released through Todo Mundo and Nonesuch, Byrne’s US labels, American Utopia was an album shaped in association with creatives at London XL Recordings subsidiary Young Turks, in which a phalanx of obscure electronic producers were drafted in to create novel soundscapes. I Dance Like This was probably the most jarring of these, with a chorus veering towards the industrial.Live, it becomes one of the night’s unexpected highlights, more heavy metal than machine music. “I dance like this,” it goes, “because it feels so damn goodIf I could dance better, well you know that I would.” Byrne and his troupe of musicians dance magnificently. You could say the also pretty much resolve the whole Cartesian mindbody split in the process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d750c75ff63d71a77eb1dbb2164bc221b64873cf/0_247_1535_921/master/1535.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c3521663c014deca121e40555ab0ede","title":"know your music now thats what i call quiz","story":"With the 100th Now compilation approaching, how much do you know about the albums that have packed together chart hits over four decades?• Making Now That’s What I Call MusicWith the 100th Now compilation coming along in a couple of weeks, it is time to test your knowledge.

As the bill was passing through the parliamentary process, Liberty said: “Whole families could be turfed from their homes because of the actions of one person. This will pile pressure on innocent and vulnerable people at a particularly difficult time for them and their family.”It said people who had passed through the criminal justice system would be doubly punished. “A basic principle of criminal law is that an inidual should be subject to appropriate punishment for their crime just once. Our criminal law is designed to do exactly this.”And the group said it believed the powers would contravene human rights laws because “only those who live in rented accommodation will ever be at the mercy of this power”.The scheme is part of the Integrated Gangs strategy, under which the politan police work with council teams, including psychologists, probation workers and social workers, to try to stop people getting involved with gangs.Supt Nick Davies, the police commander in an area of north London in which at least 14 gangs reportedly operate, has said the power to threaten whole families in which a single member is linked to gangs “seems to be a particularly effective strategy in changing the behaviour” of the gang members. In an interview with the Sunday Times earlier this month, he insisted the “threshold for eviction is high”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a9d3d2bd8eefa20670ccd58fe21db1d1ba18227/0_134_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cdcb17b4afb5ae3a600e1a514ccca49","title":"lewis hamilton pole french grand prix f1 mercedes","story":"• Briton takes 75th career pole ahead of teammate Valtteri Bottas• Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel third on grid as F1 returns to FranceA tale of two teams defined qualifying for the French Grand Prix and while for Mercedes the storyline was one they might have written themselves, for the once mighty McLaren, Paul Ricard is proving to be a pot-boiler they would rather was pulped.Lewis Hamilton took pole, the first driver to claim the top spot at the race on its return after a 10-year absence. He was pushed to the limit by his Mercedes team-mate, Valtteri Bottas, but the Briton nailed an exceptional final lap to deny the Finn, securing a one-two for the team. Better still, they were well clear of Sebastian Vettel in the Ferrari who was in third, in front of the Red Bull of Max Verstappen.For Hamilton it is his third pole of the season and his first since Spain. “I am happy with it but I am always trying for perfection,” he said. “There was time left on the track but I am really happy with pole. It is great to be back there.”McLaren, however, have now not won since Brazil in 2012 and have spent the weekend defending themselves against reports of dissatisfaction within the team, with no reprieve on the track.That they are in desperate need of improvement was clear when Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne both went out in Q1, in 16th and 18th places. They were 1.4 seconds down on Verstappen’s Red Bull, powered by the same Renault engine, their worst qualifying performance of the year.The racing director, Eric Boullier, insisted on Friday that he would not be resigning but as things stand they appear to have no answers on their lacklustre performance. “This is Formula 1. You need the right package and the right place,” said Alonso. “These last races have not been good for us but amid all this disaster we are seventh in the championship, so we must be doing something right.”The scale of their task was illustrated by Charles Leclerc making a superb run to put his Sauber into eighth on the grid.For Mercedes this was the comeback they wanted. With a fifth place to Sebastian Vettel’s win in Canada, Hamilton suffered a 15-point swing against him in the championship fight and now trails the German by a point. Crucially, the team were able to employ their upgraded engine here and it delivered, and Hamilton is in the best possible position to once again wrest the title lead from Vettel’.Hamilton had looked in fine form throughout the session and pulled it together during Q3 with some clinical finishing. He had gone quickest on his first hot run in Q3, a tenth up on Bottas and two-tenths clear of Vettel. However when they ran again, Bottas threw down the gauntlet with an exceptionally sharp lap on his final run. Hamilton responded, nailed the final sector and finished with a time of 1min 30.029sec, one-tenth up on the Finn and with Vettel scruffy on his final lap, unable to improve, he was left floundering four-tenths back.Hamilton’s third pole of the season is his first at the French Grand Prix, having taken part in the race twice before when it was held at Magny-Cours in 2007 and 2008. This 75th career pole comes on the first time he has competed at Paul Ricard, which hosted the race 14 times between 1971 and 1990 and was last won by Alain Prost for Ferrari.If they can carry their pace into the race, and their long runs had looked good, Hamilton will once again be in a position to exploit it from the front of the grid and dictate strategy, likely to be a one-stop.Although open in his concern by the threat he expected from Ferrari, Hamilton proved to have the car he required when it mattered. Once again finding the correct temperature tyre operating window was a key ingredient and over the single lap Hamilton and Mercedes had their rubber and car working in harmony.The final runs were interrupted after Romain Grosjean, at his home grand prix, lost the back end of his Haas going through turn three, suspending the session and he will start in 10th place. Daniel Ricciardo was in fifth with Kimi Raikkonen in sixth. Renault’s Carlos Sainz Jr was in seventh and the Haas’s of Kevin Magnussen in ninth. The Force Indias of Esteban Ocon and Sergio Pérez were in 11th and 13th place Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg in 12th in fornt of the Toro Roso of Pierre Gasly and the Sauber of Marcus Ericsson.Williams, another once mighty British team, also continued to struggle, with Sergey Sirotkin and Lance Stroll in 19th and 20th. Brendon Hartley in the Toro Rosso, qualified in 17th but will start from the back of the grid having taken a 35-place penalty for using a full new set of power unit components."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcaf66cc970be08509670e02c237f2a6b0961b9b/90_271_3419_2051/master/3419.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ce3c95edc7d85993ea4fdfe6e0bc715","title":"merchant navy wins dramatic diamon jubilee royal ascot horse racing","story":"• O’Brien runner holds off French challenger • Harry Angel left at start after stalls disasterA lot of drama can be packed into 72 seconds, as racegoers learned on Saturday while trying to absorb everything that happened in a wild Diamond Jubilee Stakes, won in a head‑bobbing finish by Merchant Navy.He would have been an unlucky loser having been shunted sideways by the third horse in the closing stages. But the runner-up, City Light, surely beat himself by rearing as the stalls opened while Harry Angel detonated any chance he had with his pre-race antics which reached a climax when he stuck a hind foot on a ledge along the side of the stalls shortly before they clanged open in front of him.Paddock watchers knew Harry Angel, the 5-2 favourite, was making things hard for himself from the trouble he gave as Adam Kirby was trying to mount him. He continued to play up in the stalls, kicking out with his hind legs, which was how he got his foot wedged awkwardly and sustained an injury, the extent of which will only become clear on Sunday.“Adam couldn’t see, because the horse had his stalls rug on,” Harry Angel’s trainer, Clive Cox, said. “The starter can’t see that, either.“It’s a dreadful shame. He got quite a bad puncture wound on his hind leg. It was very sore when he came off the track. So I just hope we can get him back as quickly as possible. With his leg being up on the side when the stalls opened, I’m worried that he might have pulled something high up, but we won’t know for an hour or two.”Harry Angel lost many lengths at the start, with Kirby looking round in the first few strides as if sensing something had gone wrong, but City Light made an even worse beginning to this race.As soon as the stalls opened he was up on his hind legs, giving everything else a start, though he reached top gear remarkably quickly after returning to earth and was within two lengths of the eventual winner after perhaps a furlong.“It didn’t look a race to begin with as there were horses everywhere,” said City Light’s trainer, Stephane Wattel. City Light gave the Deauville‑based Wattel his first British success after 27 years as a trainer when he won on all-weather finals day in March. Here, he came within inches of giving Wattel his first Group One race success anywhere.Instead, Merchant Navy did just enough to hold on after shrugging off the wayward US runner Bound For Nowhere, who leaned on him in the final furlong. The winner has only been trained for a matter of months by Aidan O’Brien, having been Australian-based until the spring. His former owners still have a stake in him and their celebrations were among the most raucous of the week here.His first trainer in Australia, Ciaron Maher, was present to see the colt make good on the promise he showed when based with him at Caulfield. While he is bound to reflect on what might have been if the horse stayed with him, Maher seemed genuinely elated.“They sold him for a fairly healthy sum. You can’t have your cake and eat it, but it’s just great to see the horse win. He’s come through our system. Now, to do it up here, he’s going to have a good time at stud. He’s going to be very busy in both hemispheres.“He’s got an unbelievable set of lungs and I think he’s still developing. He was a later foal. Look at the horse, he’d be better again next year.”Maher had hoped to have a runner at the Royal meeting last year until his Jameka fell ill. He promised to come back one day with a contender of his own. “It’s an unbelievable atmosphere and racecourse. It doesn’t get any bigger than this.”O’Brien’s aim now is to persuade Merchant Navy’s owners to let the horse stay with him at his Ballydoyle yard for long enough to run in next month’s July Cup at Newmarket. “The plan was that he’d run here and then go back to Australia, as I think there’s a lot of mares waiting on him there,” the Irishman said.He had thought the colt faced an “impossible” task at the weights with Redkirk Warrior, who beat him in Australia in March, but that rival was very disappointing and ran as though he had not coped well with his journey round the world.A jockey who did a sponsorship deal with a pub was stood down from competing at Royal Ascot. Charles Bishop, who started this week on such a high by winning the Queen Anne on the 33-1 shot Accidental Agent, was reported by the stewards to be above the threshold level for breath samples and had to give up his four booked mounts.“He’s ashamed and disappointed,” said Eve Johnson Houghton, the trainer of Accidental Agent, who had booked him to ride her Ice Age in the Wokingham Handicap. “Let’s hope he only does it once. It’s disappointing for him. They tell me he was only just over the limit. If his first ride had been in the second race rather than the first, he might well have passed.”Bishop declined to comment when contacted by the Racing Post.The news is tinged with irony, in view of a sponsorship deal Bishop struck two years ago with the George \u0026amp Dragon pub at Upton, close to the West Ilsley stables of his main employer, Mick Channon. Bishop posed for pictures at the time with the pub name written down the side of his breeches, but the deal has presumably lapsed as he was wearing plain breeches for Accidental Agent’s success.Meanwhile, a spokesman for Ascot said he had been pleased by how few incidents of bad behaviour there had been when the total attendance was expected to exceed 300,000. “There’s been evictions for the use of drugs,” Nick Smith said. “We’re perfectly up front about that. It’s minimal in the context of the crowd but it’s an important message that, yes, people have been evicted.”Smith said advance warning of the use of sniffer dogs had got a point across to racegoers about bringing drugs to the races. “Racing has acted very responsibly, hasn’t hidden from the issue. It’s not racing’s issue in isolation but we have to address it. Like Epsom for Derby day, we’ve got right on the front foot and, as we speak at the present moment, with good results.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad176d1d170d30a339bc9c6136fd26817fdef707/86_0_3381_2029/master/3381.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a385b7df573bd58386138295bcffd1b3","title":"south africa england match report","story":"• South Africa 10-25 England• Leicester wing seals overdue win as Farrell kicks 20 pointsCape Town’s water shortage is thankfully easing and so, at long last, is the English rugby drought.There was nothing remotely pretty about their display on a damp, blustery afternoon but, even with the series gone, the touring team finally have something to declare on their return to Heathrow. Rather than a sixth successive Test defeat niggling away at them all summer they can now lie on the beach dreaming of slightly rosier times ahead.Eddie Jones will be suitably relieved and so will his captain, Owen Farrell, whose haul of 20 points punished a slightly off-colour Springboks side in atrocious conditions. Perhaps significantly, too, there was a telling shaft of genius from the recalled Danny Cipriani, whose lovely angled cross-kick created England’s game‑clinching try for the increasingly prolific Jonny May eight minutes from time. Who knows what the future now holds for Cipriani in an England shirt but, just for a fleeting moment, his decade‑long wait for another England start was gloriously rewarded.While not even Jones would claim that England are suddenly reincarnated as world-beaters on the back of this outcome, it was also a satisfying occasion for Chris Robshaw, recalled to the back row for a contest which suited his strengths, and young Tom Curry, who has never flinched during this frequently demanding series. Not all Tests, unfortunately for the visitors, are played in these sort of aquatic conditions or at this sluggish pace. Plenty more stern examinations loom this autumn before the English patient can be classified as fully cured.In the final analysis, South Africa may also conclude that the weather beat them as much as their opponents. No one locally is complaining about a little bit of winter moisture but conditions were a far cry from the serene weather England have otherwise enjoyed on this tour. Boats have been unable to head out to Robben Island for the past two days because of high winds and choppy seas and Table Mountain was shrouded in a thick shawl of grey cloud.Even the prancing tribal warriors preceding the home side on to the field struggled to keep their footing on the treacherous surface, a sure sign this would be a very different type of game to the previous two Tests.In some respects, though, nothing much had changed with England’s early discipline once again questionable. Maro Itoje and Nathan Hughes both conceded avoidable early penalties and England were lucky that Elton Jantjies missed a very kickable chance to put the hosts ahead. Instead the more reliable Farrell put England 3-0 up from one of his side’s few forays into home territory if it was not quite the spectacular start to which they have become accustomed it was enough to give the visitors an advantage they retained until the interval.It was never going to be an easy day for creative types, let alone a fly-half starting his first Test for 10 years. Cipriani had to make do with the odd touch here and there as South Africa drove hard and tackled with enthusiasm. If ever there was a series-defining snapshot it came in the 20th minute. The tiny Faf de Klerk, like Asterix after a couple of glugs of magic potion, single-handedly drove the massive Hughes several metres backwards towards his own line, the No 8 having peeled ponderously off the back of a scrum.With Jantjies struggling to gain any kind of grip on the ball or the contest, however, England just about deserved their half-time lead, albeit with a touch of assistance from their hosts. Mike Brown and May did well to prevent what should have been an almost certain try, Jesse Kriel and S’busiso Nkosi failing to convert a clear two-on-one opportunity down the right before another Jantjes fumble four minutes before half-time gave Farrell the chance to extend England’s lead to 6-0.Having clawed back a penalty just before the break, however, the Boks were in front within seven minutes of the restart. Rassie Erasmus has made excellent use of his bench in this series and swapping his entire front row en bloc again paid immediate idends. Up the middle barrelled the impressive Steven Kitshoff and with England’s defence scrambling Warrick Gelant slipped through a lovely grubber for Kriel to gather and score.With the 37-year-old Schalk Brits on for his first Test appearance since 2015, Willie le Roux reinstated at full‑back and Handré Pollard replacing the hapless Jantjies, there was also suddenly more experience in green and gold ranks. Farrell, however, swiftly recaptured the lead with two further penalties before Cipriani and May combined brilliantly to ensure England’s first win since they defeated Wales at Twickenham back in February.If this was the final Test to be played at Newlands, sadly, the famous old stadium was not blessed with the sold-out status it deserved. It is entirely possible the weather deterred some while the fact the series was already decided probably caused a few others to stay at home. Either way, fewer than 34,000 in were in attendance and it was not a spectacle the locals will recall fondly for years.Jones’s England, in contrast will cling tight to this result all summer as proof there is a brightening future ahead of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb29ffd5999cee08c4f584a4a515e77567735d79/175_102_3183_1910/master/3183.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edbf5622c237c2d02347f73801752b51","title":"england v new zealand womens t20 series live","story":"Sophie Ecclestone took four wickets and Nat Sciver top-scored with 59 as England bounced back from their earlier defeat to South AfricaGood fightback. The hosts weren’t happy with their poor showing earlier today but bounced back really well in this second rubber to land an important blow against New Zealand in their first head-to-head contest of the summer. Ecclestone was brilliant with her four wickets, effective and efficient each time she was brought on. The captain Knight also picked up a couple. Clinical and convincing, England have won two of three games in this tournament. Mathematically, they could still miss the final but in all reality, they are in very good shape. With that, I’ll bid you farewell. Thanks for your company throughout this doubleheader. I’ll be back with you again tomorrow from Manchester for the men’s ODI between England and Australia. Until then, go well. Through the gate, Farrant gets her second wicket and that’s the match! 18th over: New Zealand 113-9 (Jensen 10, Tahuhu 5) Target 173 Knight racing through her final over and nearly slips through Tahuhu’s defences for a third scalp, just missing off-stump. 217 taken from her four, picking up wickets twice as soon as she brought herself on. That feels good as a skipper.17th over: New Zealand 107-9 (Jensen 9, Tahuhu 0) Target 173 Great day at the office for Ecclestone - perhaps her best yet in England colours - 4-1-18-4 her return in this second game after a couple of clutch wickets in the first. A fourth wicket for the teenager! Petersen got down on one knee and tried to take her over midwicket but Nat Sciver was there waiting and took the chance with ease. Ecclestone has two balls left to finish this off herself and grab five. 16th over: New Zealand 102-8 (Petersen 6, Jensen 6) Target 173 Jensen brings up the NZ 100 hitting Hazell down the ground, finding the rope. The spinner makes an athletic stop next ball in her follow through, warmly applauded by the healthy crowd who are staying to the end. They have been very good.15th over: New Zealand 93-8 (Petersen 4, Jensen 0) Target 173 Big shout from the last Ecclestone ball but it is turned down. She has another over to go and with three wickets already in her kit bag she is a decent chance for five, I reckon. There’s Sarah Taylor! To be fair, the easiest stumping she’ll get in her career after Kasperek goes for a dance and misses a good couple of metres out of the crease. Ecclestone has had an outstanding day. For the third time across the two games today, Ecclestone slips through the gate at right-handers and into their woodwork. She’s a gun. Would you believe (I barely can) it came the ball after Sarah Taylor missed a stumping! But it didn’t matter.  14th over: New Zealand 87-6 (Kerr 3, Bezuidenhout 4) Target 173 Knight goes again and does it perfectly, cramping both players from round the wicket, conceding just the three singles. 14.33 an over needed from here, for what it is worth.13th over: New Zealand 84-6 (Kerr 3, Bezuidenhout 1) Target 173 Should be another! Petersen miscues down the ground and Brunt makes wonderful ground running in off the long-on rope and gets there in time before spilling the ing chance. Full points for effort. With just four runs from the successful over, this game is as good as done. Sciver gets one first ball! A tame drive from the youngster, a thick outside edge landing with Farrant at backward point who takes the regulation catch.12th over: New Zealand 80-5 (Kerr 2, Bezuidenhout 0) Target 173 Knight closes out a fine over, just three from it. Feel a bit for Dani Hazell, deserves to be cashing in with the other spinners. Needs a bit of luck. But she’s not the type to complain. Shrubsole takes it this time! Green had a crack but trying to make room for herself gave a catch to cover, Knight into the book for a second time in the space of nine balls. England well on their way now. That’s why Ecclestone is so good. Earlier in the over, she was taken for consecutive boundaries across the line to midwicket by Green. But she held her nerve, slipping her quicker one through the gate of Martin from round the wicket, crashing into leg stump. 10th over: New Zealand 68-3 (Martin 16, Green 14) Target 173 Knight keeps swinging to changes with her spinners, going back to Hazell from the Botham Stand end. She deserves better from Shrubsole on the long-on rope, missing a regulation stop to concede a boundary. Taylor makes a great takewhip of the bails later in the over but Green is safe then keeps the strike down the ground. At the halfway mark, New Zealand need more than ten an over from here. Hard yards.9th over: New Zealand 61-3 (Martin 16, Green 7) Target 173 Farrant is back and returns with a half-tracker that is creamed by Martin to the midwicket boundary. I’m sure they will go after the junior seamer here - makes sense. Nice cut from the same player later in the set but to the sweeper, Green then picking out the fielder at backward square leg. Nice change of pace to finish to beat the bat. That’ll help with confidence.8th over: New Zealand 53-3 (Martin 10, Green 5) Target 173 Nothing wrong with this successful Knight over until the final delivery, and even that isn’t a poor ball as much as it is confident batting from Green who comes down the track and successfully beats mid-off with a well-struck drive. With it, New Zealand’s 50 is up. Great catch! Satterthwaite smacked that back at the England captain and she took it close to her body. Second ball into the attack and she’s into the book. New Zealand in some strife with their most experienced trio already back in the shed. 7th over: New Zealand 47-2 (Martin 9, Satterthwaite 2) Target 173 Dani Hazell on for her first bowl of the innings. Martin immediately goes after her, smashing on one knee over midwicket and into the rope. They are asking on telly why Ecclestone has been taken off after such a high-quality maiden. Maybe with the left-hander Satterthwaite walking out? Plenty of runs throughout the over, every ball scored off.“Pure pressure from England,” says Charlotte Edwards and that’s spot on. A string of dots broken only by a couple of singles into the deep, then Brunt slips one back towards the brilliant visiting captain and it’s an easy decision for the umpire. Very out. Huge wicket.6th over: New Zealand 37-2 (Martin 2, Satterthwaite 0) Target 173 And that’s the end of the power play.5th over: New Zealand 37-1 (Bates 22, Martin 2) Target 173 Time for spin with Sophie Ecclestone. The tall left-armer is immediately asking questions of Martin then one of the umpire with a very good leg before shout but it is sliding down. Mark Butcher on telly is comparing her action to Monty Panesar, which isn’t a bad call if you ask me. Another lbw shout next ball! A carbon copy, beating her on the inside edge but not quite straightening. Martin can’t lay a bat on her here. Classy bowling from the teenager. A maiden! She is quite outstanding. 4th over: New Zealand 37-1 (Bates 22, Martin 2) Target 173 Brunt replaces Farrant. The leader of this attack knows the drill, having played so much cricket with and against Bates over the journey. Respect shown from the White Ferns captain until she is given a bit of width, carving hard to deep backward point and getting a boundary with Farrant unable to make a tough stop. 3rd over: New Zealand 32-1 (Bates 18, Martin 1) Target 173 Shot! Shrubsole just a tad short and Bates has enough time to turn her wrists through midwicket. Then another boundary to finish the over with a neat little tuck that beats the short fine leg. Now she’s cooking. 2nd over: New Zealand 23-1 (Bates 10, Martin 0) Target 173 Bates strikes back to back fours to end the over, jumping on a short ball then leaning into a full toss, beating mid-off inside the circle. Into double figures. It isn’t overstating it to say that if Suzie Bates an be there for the full 20 overs, the visitors will more than likely win. She’s in that kind of form. It makes the next few overs very important for England.Caught on the midwicket boundary by Wyatt! That’s a crucial moment in the game for the hosts, coming just a couple of balls after Devine hit her second six, lifting Farrant behind square with ease. But the bowler, into the team for Gunn, held her nerve and Devine picked the wrong delivery to swing at. 1st over: New Zealand 8-0 (Devine 7, Bates 1) Target 173 Right, Sophie Devine. She waits two balls before putting Shrubsole over the ropes at midwicket. She is in outrageous form since going to the top of the list in both 20 and 50 over cricket, forming a perfect partnership with her skipper Bates, who is off the mark with a single to keep the strike.20th over: England 172-7 (Ecclestone 9, Hazell 7) Dani Hazell! A wonderful little two-ball cameo to finish! She hits to long-off and with just enough spin to deny Tahuhu who misfields on the rope. She then adds three more out to cover with some desperate running with Ecclestone. 19 from the final over. Considering the stumble they had losing three wickets about three-quarters of the way through their innings, it is a fantastic effort from the hosts. Plenty to bowl at. Back with the NZ reply at 7:10pm.Caught at cover with a couple of balls to go but Shrubsole more than did her job. Her feet were fantastic to begin this final over dancing at Kasperek twice in a row for four then six! Through cover then over long-off! That pushed the hosts beyond the 160 they made earlier in the day. 19th over: England 153-7 (Shrubsole 10, Ecclestone 9) Shot! Ecclestone pulls Devine hard through midwicket for four. Her first ball in Test cricket in Sydney last year went for six if memory serves me correct (it usually does) so she can hold a stick. The 150 up later in the over as they strive to find the ropes again. They don’t quite manage that but the running is committed, Shrubsole turning one into two at cover. She keeps the strike for the final over as well. They did a good job taking ten runs from that set.18th over: England 143-7 (Shrubsole 7, Ecclestone 2) Just four singles from the over. A lot of work for the bowlers with bats in their hands for England to now to stick the landing.A fine innings comes to an end, Nat Sciver getting outside the line of off-stump in order to profit down with the slog sweep but instead she picks out the fielder on circle at short fine, Jensen taking a nice catch. It is apart a bit for England here at the death. 17th over: England 139-6 (Sciver 59, Shrubsole 5) Devine’s hat-trick ball was a missed yorker, Shrubsole clipping the low full-toss, her first ball, for four. Seven runs and two wickets from the Devine over. She has one more up her sleeve for the death.

To conclude, here’s a report. Thomas Callaghan emails in, and sees some bad portents for Southern Hemisphere rugby. “Hello John, looks like two defeats out of three for ‘SH Giants’. I reckon that if all three tests had been played at sea level England would have won 3-0.”Eddie Jones speaks and is smiling: “It’s a great reward for the players. We have lacked emotional control and today we were able to control those moments. We stuck to a tactical plan..we we got seduced by the scoreboard a little bit. Some players have come through, some have fallen by the wayside, and it’s been a great learning experience for the World Cup. “It’s never a dead rubber...An England team had never won at Newlands before. We want to be the world’s best team and we are back on the road again.On Cipriani: “We said there might be few opportunities and he might be good enough to take them. And he was.”Schalk Brits, back out of retirement, speaks: “It was fantastic. I am looking forward to seeing what this team can do. We will have a couple of beer and a glass of wine and a chat. You want to play for your country. It would be an honour if they asked me to keep in playing. I will have to speak to my wife.”Ben Youngs speaks and is in a better mood than last week: “Much better, apologies for that. We were able to deal with the emotion. It was about working really hard. When the rain comes in, you just realise that we back our defence.” South Africa won the series but that felt like an important win from England and for Eddie Jones in particular. His team did the basics right, and dealt better with the horrible conditions. It was ugly, until that piece of genius from Cipriani and May. 80 mins: The ball is hacked out of bounds as soon as the hooter sounds and England have won, their fourth win in South Africa. 79 mins: England trying to stoosh their way to another try. South Africa defending a lost cause and being pushed back by repeated phases before England hold on for too long. 77 mins: Another penalty is won by Marler, who forces another error from the Springboks. Farrell kicks for a line out. 76 mins: South Africa have gone horribly ragged. Pollard never got the chance to exert the control that his team had lost. The boot of the captain is unerring once more as another penalty booms between the posts. That has to be it. 74 mins: Worth mentioning that Farrell’s conversion was almost as inspired. 73 mins: Eddie Jones really enjoyed that. Vindication of sorts from his selection of Cipriani to a much more disciplined display. That May try, though, was stardust on the mud heap that preceded it. Utter brilliance from Cipriani, a wonderful kick scythes to the wing from midfield and May es over to score in the corner. That changes everything and that’s what we wanted to see from Cipriani, who has seized his chance. 69 mins: And in the scrum, England look the stronger, too, and South Africa pile in to concede a penalty. The Springboks have been a turnover machine. 68 mins: Duane Vermeulen looks to have hurt himself and is not taking part in the action. From the line out, England force a scum, showing that their forwards are in the ascendancy. 66 mins: De Klerk had to clear his lines, and England win the line out well. This time, though, South Africa win the ball back from the breakdown. Excellent work from Duane Vermeulen on the ground. The home team win a free-kick and kick for touch. 65 mins: Intelligent kicking from Farrell pins back South Africa, but De Klerk dug the ball out from the line out.64 mins: Robin Hazlehurst emails in. “Presumably the conditions are preventing Cippers from creating magic but is Eddie going to overlook that and drop him again, saying he didn’t do enough? That would be very Eddie.”62 mins: England’s forwards in the ascendancy at the moment as a chorus of Karma Chameleon plays out. Now they win a line out against the head. This is better from England if almost deliberately lacking in artfulness. 61 mins: Farrell misses a drop goal! At last, some phases of play from the English team, with Itoje piling forward. That was never likely to go in from that distance and was wasteful. 59 mins: More scrappiness in the conditions force another England penalty. De Klerk caught offside. England take the line out and Ben Youngs charges on. 58 mins: Pollard is on, which is surely bad news for the English. South Africa had been lacking control behind the scrum due to Jantjie’s struggles. Farrell booms through the posts again. He has been relentless. 55 mins: Wilson blocks a Jantjies kick to set up an England attack. Offside means that England have another penalty. South Africa’s fly-half has not been great and will be imminently replaced by Andre Pollard. 54 mins: Cipriani, who has been quiet, then plays a ball narrowly forward. These are perhaps not the conditions that suit his talents. 53 mins: England miss a penalty! Gelant makes another mistake to almost concede the three points, undoing the good work for that South Africa try. The angle and distance are too much for Elliott Daly. England hit back almost immediately from the boot of Farrell after Gelant charges in through the side. 47 mins: That was excellent from South Africa, a total contrast to what came before. Steven Kitshoff makes an instant impact with a run and Kriel seizes on a Gelant kick, and South Africa have the lead when the conversion goes over. 44 mins: Schalk Brits comes on for the wondrously named Chiliboy Ralepelle, and Steven Kitshoff comes on at loosehead prop. No mistake from Farrell from 40 yards or so. It flew through the posts. 42 mins: And England force a penalty when South Africa collapse in the scrum. 41 mins: Farrell’s kick-off begins the second half, and another session of kicking at each other before Elton Jantjies makes another handling error from a Youngs box kick. England have a scrum. This clip shows why this has not been much of a spectacle. The prelims the best bit so far.Some deserved approval for Johnny May from Will “Black Label” Carling. A reminder of today’s test from Sydney. Half-time: Better from England, certainly more solid than the chaos of the High Veldt, but the conditions are doing little to help this as a spectacle. South Africa not exactly looking refreshed by those five changes. The last action of the half sees Jantjies, who has struggled in the first half, leave three points in it with a not very convincing kick. 39 mins: South Africa win their own scrum, and the Beast doesn’t get too far before being baulked to the ground. The home team looking predictable but do manage to force a penalty as the buzzer sounds. 38 mins: England win a line out at the second time of asking as Launchbury catches a rebound. Mike Brown smelled open territory but that slippery pill fell from his hand after Kriel got a hand to the ball. From an inside left position, Farrell booms between the posts. Easy for him. England making fewer mistakes and profiting from that. 33 mins: Robshaw seizes on a handling error from Jantjies. A gift and some decent territory. A penalty is forced by Jamie George and after five phases of possession, South Africa are brought back. 32 mins: Big push from South Africa and one that is resisted. Curry wins the penalty and England celebrate wildly. 30 mins: Nathan Hughes gets rocked back and the ball turns over. Nkosi, in open space, tried to kick on for a try and May has to run all the way from behind the try line to get the ball clear. The best running of the game so far, but at the wrong end of the field. 28 mins: South Africa won the scrum and forced England back into their own half. Both teams trying to force the issue but so many mistakes with bad kicks and handling errors are making this a dire spectacle so far. 27 mins: Another scrum and far away from where England would have liked. 25 mins: A mess of a scrum reflects the overall match. England get a free-kick and pile into heavy traffic. Farrell kicks wide to try and open stuff up. But the ball is given away, only for Curry to force a penalty. Daly kicks out on the full. That’s a dreadful waste. 24 mins: England keep the ball from their line-out, but lose the ball again. Too many handling errors again? Certainly too many turnovers. The South Africans knock on. Another scrum. This game is, er, scrappy.

Her two-room house is in a village called Relela, in a verdant, hilly region of the Limpopo province, five hours’ drive north-east of Johannesburg. If you visited Relela, you might be struck by several things the village lacks – modern sanitation, decent roads, reliable electricity – before you were struck by a lack of street names or house numbers. But living essentially off-map has considerable consequence for people like Eunice. It makes it tough to get a bank account, hard to register to vote, difficult to apply for a job or even receive a letter. For the moment, though, those ongoing concerns are eclipsed by another, larger anxiety. Eunice Sewaphe is nine months pregnant – her first child is due in two days’ time – and she is not quite sure, without an address, how she will get to hospital.Sitting in the sun with Eunice and her neighbours outside her house, in a yard in which chickens peck in the red dirt, she explained to me, somewhat hesitantly, her current plan for the imminent arrival. The nearest hospital, Van Velden, in the town of Tzaneen, is 40 minutes away by car. When Eunice goes into labour, she will have to somehow get to the main road a couple of miles away in order to find a taxi, for which she and her husband have been saving up a few rand a week. If there are complications, or if the baby arrives at night, she may need an ambulance. But since no ambulance could find her house without an address, this will again necessitate her getting out to the main road. In the past, women from Relela, in prolonged labour, have had to be taken in wheelbarrows to wait for emergency transport that may or may not come.The maternal mortality rates in South Africa remain stubbornly high. Of 1.1 million births a year, 34,000 babies die. More than 1,500 women lose their lives each year in childbirth. Those statistics are a fact of life in Relela. Josephina Mohatli is one of Eunice’s neighbours. She explains quietly how she went into labour with her first child prematurely. When she finally managed to get a taxi, she was taken to two local clinics and then a private doctor, none of which were able to help her. When she finally reached the hospital after several desperate hours, her baby had died.I have come up to Relela with Dr Coenie Louw, who is the regional head of the charity Gateway Health, which is concerned with improving those mortality statistics. Dr Louw, 51, speaks with a gruff Afrikaans accent that belies his evangelist’s optimism to make a change for these women. “Though frankly,” he says, “if I don’t know where you are, I can’t help you.”Google Maps will only bring help to the edge of the village. “We tried to do something by triangulating between three cell phone towers,” he says, which proved predictably unreliable. Searching for other solutions, Louw came across what3words, the innovative British technology that, among many other things, neatly solves the question of how an ambulance might find Eunice Sewaphe.Five years ago, the founders of what3words ided the entire surface of the planet into a grid of squares, each one measuring 3 metres by 3 metres. There are 57tn of these squares, and each one of them has been assigned a unique three-word address. My own front door in London has the three-word address “.brave.tree”.The front door of Eunice’s house in Relela might be “irrigates.joyful.zipper” (or, in Zulu, “phephani.khuluma.bubhaka”). To test the system, I have driven up here with one of Gateway Health’s drivers, Mandla Maluleke. Maluleke has keyed the three-word code into his phone app, which has dropped a pin on a conventional mapping system. Once we leave the main highway, the GPS immediately signals “unknown road”, but even so, after many twists and turns it takes us precisely to “irrigates.joyful.zipper”, and Eunice’s front door.The what3words technology was the idea of Chris Sheldrick, a native of rural Hertfordshire (who knows what it is like to stand out in a country lane flagging down delivery drivers armed only with a postcode). Like all the best ideas he developed this one to cope with a specific problem that had maddened him. Sheldrick, 35, had started life as a musician, and then after a sleepwalking accident, which damaged his wrist, he set up a business organising musicians and production for festivals and parties around the world. Despite the advent of Google Maps, the problem that dogged his business was bands turning up at the wrong site entrance. Sheldrick employed a person whose sole duty was to man a phone line trying to get a band to the right field. Having given up on conventional satnav they tried using GPS co-ordinates, but get one figure wrong, and the party never got started.Sheldrick thought that there had to be a better way. Looking back now, he says that “the key thing we were trying to solve with what3words was how do we get 15 digits of latitude and longitude into a more communicable human form”. Advances in satellite mapping and navigation meant that if you were a Deliveroo rider or an Amazon courier or a last-minute saxophonist you were never really lost, but also often not exactly in the right place. Companies like Google and TomTom recognised this problem, but the solution they developed was an alphanumeric code of nine characters. For Sheldrick that was clearly a nonstarter: “When someone asked where you lived, it would be like trying to remember your wifi router password.” That’s when this idea of three words came up. A bit of maths proved it was possible. “With 40,000 recognisable dictionary words, you have 64tn combinations, and there are 57tn squares.”The algorithm behind what3words took six months to write. Sheldrick worked on it with two friends he had grown up with. Mohan Ganesalingham, a maths fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, and Jack Waley-Cohen, a full-time quiz obsessive and question-setter for Only Connect. After the initial mapping was complete, they incorporated an error-correction algorithm, which places similar-sounding combinations a very long way apart. And then there was the question of language: using a team of linguists, what3words is now available in a couple of dozen tongues, from Arabic to Zulu.It has also grown from a company of three to now around 70 full-time employees after two multimillion-dollar rounds of venture capital.The challenge now is educating the world in their system. “We obviously aim to be a global standard,” Sheldrick says. To that end they have recently signed licensing agreements with companies including Mercedes, which will utilise the system in its A-class cars, including using voice activation, and TomTom, which will incorporate three-word commands in its navigation platforms. The technology also offers an off-the-shelf solution to the many countries that lack any kind of universal address system. Ten governments and their postal services – including Mongolia, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Tuvalu – have signed up to the idea.“If you think about addresses,” Sheldrick says, “some are from centuries ago, some are from last week, but there is also so much of the world that has not engaged with that. And that can include where I live in rural Hertfordshire, to our office in London where the postcode does not point to the right place, to entire countries, like Mongolia or Saudi Arabia, which have just never known anything other than using directions.” Given that smartphones now have such wide penetration, he believes there is the opportunity to leapfrog conventional address systems.Sheldrick is watching the slow advance of his idea in travel guides and email signatures and Airbnb booking forms. The technology has already proved invaluable in disaster zones and refugee camps as well as at rock festivals. It could easily enable drone delivery. Earlier this month the lead GP on the Isle of Mull, Dr Brian Prendergast, sick of being unable to find his patients, requested they all sign up to it.Lyndsey Duff, the head of what3words’ two-woman South African office got quite emotional, she says, when she first heard about the possibilities of the technology two years ago. She was working at the time for the South African High Commission in London. There are many ways in which South Africa was historically ided but one of them, she suggests, “was always by maps”. While the whites-only areas of apartheid cities had street names, the black townships and rural villages like Relela were just inked in as grey spaces. “For me, what3words is the perfect balance of good business and doing good,” Duff says. She points to the fact that iStore – the South African equivalent of Apple Store – is now using what3words for its deliveries, as well as to the potential of projects like Gateway Health (which use the service for a nominal fee). Not only ecommerce, but also social progress is being held up by the absence of “last mile” technology that will take you where you need to get, Duff suggests.On the ground, that last mile can still be quite a hard sell. In Limpopo, as elsewhere, Gateway Health is faced with the question of how to make the technology go viral. Dr Louw believes it takes a village. His strategy is to use Relela as a pilot scheme for what3words, to show its positive impact on maternal health, and to use that case study to try to persuade regional and national government to adopt the address system as standard.In Relela, I joined him as he tried to sell the benefits to perhaps the toughest crowd of all, the village’s hereditary chief and councilmen, who have had plenty of white men from Johannesburg come here and tell them how they can improve the way they have always done things. The chief’s big brick house is at the top of a hill looking down the valley toward the Cloud Mountains. In late afternoon, we are invited to sit in his front yard, where benches have been set up for a council meeting under a large, spreading jacaranda tree. When Louw makes his pitch for every home in Relela to utilise a what3words address, he is met with silence. This, it is eventually explained, is because the council meeting does not yet have a quorum. We sit on the benches for a long, chill hour while the sun goes down, waiting for the other two councillors to come up the hill. Eventually when it is getting dark and six men are present, Louw repeats his pitch. Again, silence.I have a go. “If someone was to come to the village from outside,” I say, “how might they currently find the person they wanted to meet?”“But,” I say, “what if a child was sick, and needed an ambulance. Or a woman was in distress, in labour? What if the zone leader was out?”The councilmen discuss these questions gravely. “Then that would be a problem,” Mowane concludes.Louw shows a video on his phone about how what3words might solve that problem. At this point, slowly, almost imperceptibly, a smile spreads across one or two of the councilmen’s faces. Another meeting is arranged, this one involving a big screen for the villagers, and lunch.On the way back down from the chief’s house, Louw suggests this is progress. He believes in a year or two the argument will be won, and there will be a team of community drivers on hand to get women like Eunice Sewaphe to hospital. “It is exciting times,” he insists. There are 139 villages like Relela in this region. But once Relela has addressed itself, then – neighbours being neighbours – he hopes the other 138 will follow. Beyond this valley, there are 4 billion people without an address. Perhaps technology can now put them on a map, three words at a time.Tim Adams travelled to South Africa as a guest of what3words and Gateway Health"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ad6b3ccb22aa2808b641e1f1eefc34c40fec47/0_162_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4621b63bbb7b6ba6e988ef35b898bc0d","title":"rufus wainwright opera transfigured second classical release change direction","story":"At 44, the singer and songwriter Rufus Wainwright is shortly to loose his second opera on the world. Hadrian, which opens in Canada later this year, will tell of the Roman emperor’s long relationship with his lover, Antinous. And creating it has been a reverent, careful step for Wainwright, who says that opera now serves as his “religion in many ways”.“I’ve often gone into the opera house in quite a state yet come out completely transfigured, so when I gear up to work in that world, it is like I am going into the clergy,” he tells the Observer.On 22 June, Wainwright, who has built up an international following with his swirling, emotionally candid melodies, performed in the grounds of Kenwood House in London and then at Coventry cathedral to adoring fans. This week he will be doing gigs in Whitley Bay, Leeds and Bath. Yet he is full of disappointment about the pop world. “I always loved opera, and now the mainstream pop business has imploded and is not something I can relate to any more, it opens up the territory for a bunch of other things.” Far from waving farewell to his past, however, Wainwright is announcing the dates of a new tour that will bring him to Britain next spring to celebrate his first two albums, released two decades ago. “I’m excited to examine that material again,” he says. “At first I thought I’d even perform the albums back to back. I haven’t discarded that idea, but it would be a long evening.”His lack of faith in the pop scene is partly due, he says, to all the “incredibly talented and rich and successful young people out there who are still obsessed with making more money and with being the centre of attention”. He cannot see why these stars, once they make it, would not want simply to make the music they like, instead of serving an industry. He was lucky, he now suspects, not to have had great fame and cash thrust upon him at an early age: “I know when that happens you create this machine around you that has to be fed, so I guess I dodged a bullet in not having that occur.”Wainwright, a Canadian-American who grew up in Montreal and lives in Los Angeles, says he is “definitely at one of those vantage-point periods” of his life where he is enjoying looking both forward and back. He was 24 when his first, self-titled album marked him out from the crowd in 1998. Today, eight studio albums later, he is a healthier, gym-going performer, happy with his achievements.And the tour is not the only challenge ahead: Wainwright has been back into the studio in LA to record a new album with the leading US producer Mitchell Froom. “They are songs that bubbled up during my years doing operas, and getting frustrated with directors and conductors and opera houses. So I’ve been going into a room and singing them all to fuck off.”Unsurprising, then, that people have a hard time categorising Wainwright. He has been hailed as a balladeer, a troubadour, a torch song singer and even as “the king of baroque pop”. But for him the point is that he does not produce commercially safe work. The trouble with the music industry, he argues, is that the value of the song lyric has been undermined. And it is a trend he regrets all the more since the death of Leonard Cohen in 2016. The fellow Canadian was grandfather to Viva, the daughter that Wainwright shares and raises with his old friend, Lorca Cohen. “Lyrics are the wood the ship is made from, as opposed to the sail, the music. Writing them is an art form in itself and having known Leonard very well, I know losing him was a great passing of that concept.”Melodies, Wainwright says, come to him naturally, as “a function of my body” lyrics though, he has to “fashion and test out”. “It’s not that I am such a great lyric writer, but I do know what makes a great lyric. That’s maybe because I am actually a really great singer, I can feel it in my gut,” he playfully suggests.Wainwright and his younger sister Martha, the folk rock singer, sprang together from a deep well of music. Their father is the singer and actor Loudon Wainwright III and their mother, the late Kate McGarrigle.“No matter whether we were at a dinner party, or at a restaurant, if there was a piano around, my mother, after a couple of drinks, would usually end up drawn to it,” he remembers. “She was almost stricken with this musical mania. I need music in order to survive, but she was particularly afflicted. And what at times was even annoying, now seems wonderful to have experienced.”Wainwright turned his back on a potential career in classical music when Loudon handed a tape of his son’s music to the producer Van Dyke Parks. But he does not blame his father for the subsequent change of direction. The two have had their conflicts, notably chronicled in the son’s song Dinner at Eight, but family peace now reigns. “I was fortunate. I wouldn’t have had it any other way. I would have made it come hell or high water, but I do owe a lot to Loudon – and he owes a lot to me. We owe a lot to each other, Loudon and I. It is nice now to be able to receive and to give.”While Wainwright admits this is not opera’s most popular age, he does detect a tipping point on the horizon. “With what is going on politically, art and music will have to start to express the sense of horror and sadness and angst. And opera still holds a kind of gravitas that even children see. They know it is profound and it impresses them.”Hadrian, which was composed for the Canadian Opera Company, follows Wainwright’s first opera Prima Donna, which premiered at the Manchester International Festival in 2009. Sung in English and Latin, Hadrian was inspired by the French author Marguerite Yourcenar’s 1951 account of the emperor’s affair with Antinous and is to star the leading American baritone Thomas Hampson. By shining a light on Hadrian now, 1,880 years after his death, its composer hopes to tackle “some pretty contemporary issues”.“Hadrian created Palestine and was responsible for the first big Jewish massacre that occurred in documented history,” says Wainwright, referring to the Great Revolt of AD 66-73, the first recorded war between the Romans and the Jews in Judea. “So the borders he initiated are still being fought over. And a lot of the issues of homosexuality are identical today. Exceptions were made then, but the love between Hadrian and Antinous was a bona fide relationship and seen as very wrong.”His new work qualifies as an opera by anybody’s reckoning, Wainwright says. Importantly, it is through-composed – meaning the music doesn’t repeat itself – and will be performed unamplified. He is aiming, he says, for the kind of timelessness the best operas achieve.“My goal would be to recreate that freshness of effect with my work. And maybe it is my annoyingly positive attitude, but I feel I am laying this massive trap that all of these young people will stumble into suddenly as they get older. After all, a certain percentage of those young wild people at Glastonbury will end up sitting through the Ring Cycle one day.”When Wainwright performed at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden over five nights in 2010, box office receipts showed that three-quarters of the audience had never been there before. “So the opera world needs me!” Wainwright laughs, revealing his plan for a third and final opera. “That would be my last, because it is so labour intensive. And it is financially insane when you have a daughter to put through school and mortgages to pay.”All Of These Poses Anniversary Tour 2019 will bring Wainwright to the Royal Albert Hall in London, and to Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow in April next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a593572ff10df75df5c094795f3859a1c638df8/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c039241d15ad2589100932af68e7c621","title":"kit harington rose leslie game of thrones stars marry","story":"Couple who met on set of TV series exchanged vows at Rayne church in AberdeenshireGame of Thrones actor Rose Leslie has arrived at the church where she is marrying her former co-star Kit Harington.She was accompanied by her father as she arrived at Rayne church in Kirkton of Rayne, Aberdeenshire, wearing a flowing ivory gown and veil. Stepping out of the car, she smiled at the crowd gathered outside the venue and said “Hello everyone”. Harington, wearing a morning suit, arrived earlier on Saturday afternoon. Guests at the wedding include Game of Thrones stars Peter Dinklage, Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner and Emilia Clarke. The couple, both aged 31, met in 2012 when they played on-screen lovers Jon Snow and Ygritte in the TV drama. They are celebrating at Leslie’s 12th-century family castle in Scotland. Fans of the series have been gathering outside Wardhill Castle in Aberdeenshire hoping to catch a glimpse of the couple.Speaking outside the castle, Leslie’s father, Sebastian, said: “We are absolutely thrilled for Kit and Rose to be marrying today.” The local councillor added: “It’s an absolutely lovely day for us.“It’s a great day for Aberdeenshire. We are using local caterers, local lighting, local flowers.”Two years after they met, Leslie left Game of Thrones, while Harington has become one of the show’s most popular stars, having appeared in every episode.

So if you’re looking for counterculture sounds, it’s here you’ll find songs that spoke for a generationImmersion in Seattle’s music scene begins minutes after disembarking at Sea-Tac, the city’s international airport, which houses a store devoted to the record company Sub Pop. In 1988, the then shoestring Sub Pop Records released Nirvana’s debut single it subsequently became as synonymous with Seattle as Motown is with Detroit. Opening our hipster playlist is Nirvana’s fourth single, Smells Like Teen Spirit, released three years later. It became a massive hit across the world, igniting the rock phenomenon that would transform Seattle, a hitherto obscure enclave in America’s far north-west, into an epicentre of cool.Previous generations of Seattle musicians took for granted that they would have to leave their hometown if they wanted a successful career. Arguably the greatest electric guitarist of all-time, Jimi Hendrix is up next – he was born and raised in Seattle, although only found fame after moving to London.Right now, Seattle’s music has never been so rich or erse. Witness the contrast of Fleet Foxes’ Sun it Rises, a yearning choral-Americana hymn to frontier spirits, with avant-hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces. Shine a Light hails from their futuristic twin Quazarz album – released in 2017 by a certain indie record label with its own airport shop.Portland has become renowned in recent years for its ultra-progressive attitudes – as satirised by the comedy series Portlandia – but the city’s hippy roots have long attracted free-thinkers from all over America. Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys.

A spokesman for Arrington, Michael Mule, told news outlets the state representative from Summerville had undergone surgery and was recovering in a Charleston-area hospital. Arrington sustained a back fracture, Mule said, as well as several broken ribs. She had surgery to remove portions of her small intestine and colon.Arrington would need more surgeries, Mule said, as well as a stint to repair the partial collapse of the primary artery in her legs. She would need to stay in hospital for two weeks. He told news outlets Arrington was alert and talking.The Charleston county sheriff’s office said Arrington, 47, and a friend were traveling southbound on US Highway 17 around 9pm on Friday when a driver traveling in the wrong direction hit their vehicle.Sheriff’s captain Roger Antonio said the other driver, who was not immediately identified, died at the scene. Authorities said the driver of the car in which Arrington was a passenger, 59-year-old Jacqueline Goff of Mandeville, Louisiana, also suffered serious injuries. “Katie asks for your continued prayers for the deceased and the deceased’s family, as well as prayers for a quick recovery for Katie and her friend,” Mule said in a statement. A statement on Arrington’s Twitter account said: “It is from her strong faith, the support of her family, the prayers and support of our community, and the incredible doctors and staff at the hospital that she is certain she will be back to work for our state soon.”Arrington beat Sanford in a GOP primary earlier this month, after repeatedly highlighting the former governor’s criticism of Donald Trump. The president weighed in hours before polls closed, endorsing Arrington and denouncing Sanford as “nothing but trouble”.On Saturday, the president tweeted: “My thoughts and prayers are with Representative Katie Arrington of South Carolina, including all of those involved in last nights car accident, and their families.”Sanford posted a link to a story about the car crash on Twitter, writing: “Our thoughts and prayers this morning go to Katie Arrington, her family and those involved in last night’s automobile accident.” The Democratic nominee who will face Arrington in November, Joe Cunningham, said he was suspending his campaign until further notice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d64639bd23ef4445039890f6608fc52c957f9844/0_23_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a721b08f52ad9b5898a8bee0a8c5af28","title":"explosion rally new ethiopian prime minister abiy ahmed","story":"Abiy Ahmed commented on Addis Ababa blast that killed one and injured more than 100, saying ‘killing others is a defeat’Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s new prime minister, has vowed to continue his radical programme of reforms after more than 100 people were injured by an explosion at a rally in his support in Addis Ababa on Saturday.The 41-year-old ex-soldier, who took office in April, had just finished speaking when what is thought to be a grenade was thrown at the stage in the capital’s Meskel Square.Footage showed the prime minister being rushed from the scene by security guards.Abiy later described the explosion as a “well-orchestrated attack”, but one that failed.“A few Ethiopians were injured. There are a few people who lost their lives,” he said in a televised address. “Love always wins. Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded.”At least one person was killed and 153 people were injured, 10 critically, the health minister, Amir Aman said.Seyoum Teshome, a member of the organising committee, said the attack had involved a grenade. “Someone tried to hurl it to the stage where the prime minister was,” Teshome told Reuters.Tens of thousands had filled the square in the centre of the Ethiopian capital to hear Abiy, who was wearing a cowboy hat and T-shirt, speak.Observers said the size of the crowd underlined the broad-based popular support for Africa’s youngest national leader and the deep desire for change in the country of 100 million after decades of authoritarian rule.Many supporters wore clothes displaying Abiy’s image and carried signs saying “One Love, One Ethiopia”.Abiy, who was appointed prime minister following the unexpected resignation of his predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn, in February, told the crowd change was coming and there was no turning back.“For the past 100 years hate has done a great deal of damage to us,” he said, stressing the need for more reforms.Since taking power, Abiy has ordered the release of thousands of prisoners, opened state-owned companies to private investment and dramatically loosened restrictions on media.Most recently, he stunned Ethiopians by saying he was prepared to fully implement an 18-year-old peace deal with Eritrea aimed at ending a two-year war between the country and its neighbour that reached a stalemate and had resulted into an expensive military buildup by both countries.The move is one of a series that observers say could transform the region. Abiy has also said he will scrap trade barriers with Somalia and spoken of his desire for closer integration with Ethiopia’s unstable and violent neighbour as part of a wider effort to create a single market in the Horn of Africa.However, the reform programme has prompted resistance from certain groups and some Ethiopians near the border with Eritrea have protested against the peace deal.Most significantly, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, a party in Ethiopia’s ruling coalition that has been the dominant force in government for most of the past 27 years, said the announcement on the peace deal had been made before the ruling coalition’s congress met to discuss it.Ethiopia’s government, which came to power 27 years ago after more than a decade of civil war, is split by factional battles between four ethnically-based parties as well as fierce competition between institutions and iniduals.Abiy is the first leader from Ethiopia’s largest ethnic community, the Oromo, which has complained for decades of economic, cultural and political marginalisation.Some have hailed him as Ethiopia’s Mikhail Gorbachev, a reference to the leader who attempted to bring rapid change to the ailing Soviet Union in the late 1980s.“The grenade attack in Addis may be well linked to hardliners who do not want to see dialogue and conciliation with Eritrea. However, it may also be in response to perceived Tigrayan marginalisation andor dissent within the military. Either way, it shows that the reforms are not window dressing,” said Ryan Cummings, a South Africa based security analyst.The US embassy said violence has no place as Ethiopia pursues meaningful political and economic reforms.Despite an International Monetary Fund forecast predicting that Ethiopia will be the fastest-growing economy in sub-Saharan Africa in 2018, few doubt the scale of the problems Abiy faces. But there is growing inequality, insufficient employment opportunities for a huge number of graduates and environmental damage.Efforts to expand Addis Ababa, which resulted in the displacement of farmers from its surrounding area, sparked anti-government protests in 2014 that led to the imposition of a nine-month state of emergency last year. About a million Ethiopians have been driven from their homes by a land and ethnicity-fuelled crisis that has gripped the nation for years and escalated in recent months. Since taking office, Abiy has visited most regions of Ethiopia and has repeatedly called for unity between its ethnic groups.He described the grenade attack as “an unsuccessful attempt by forces who do not want to see Ethiopia united”.

Damian Collins will join forces with the former Wales rugby union captain Gareth Thomas on Monday to launch a draft amendment to the Football Offences Act 1991 that would outlaw indecent and homophobic chanting.Chanting of an “indecent or racialist” nature is banned at football games, but due to confusion over its interpretation the draft bill aims to explicitly ban chants and gestures that make indecent references to “sexual orientation and gender identity”.The MP for Folkestone and Hythe said: “The time has come to move from acknowledgement to action. That is why Gareth and I are seeking to amend the Football Offences Act 1991 to make chanting or gesturing of an indecent nature with reference to sexual orientation or gender identity against the law. “When the Football Offences Act came into force, it made racialist abuse within football stadia illegal. The proposed amendment, which I will present to the House of Commons on Monday, seeks to extend that legal protection to LGBT+ players and fans.” Collins cited the 10,000 Swiss francs (£7,615) fine handed to the Mexico football federation over chants by some fans last weekend and called for sport governing bodies to take stern action against similar instances. He said: “Whilst, if enacted, the bill would protect LGBT+ fans and players in the UK, recent events, including at the World Cup, have once again demonstrated that homophobic abuse takes place at football matches the world over. “Fifa and other sports governing bodies should take the necessary steps to ensure that homophobic abuse will never be tolerated and that action will be taken against people that engage in activities like these, no matter where the game is played. “We hope that the bill will soon become law and will contribute to making football a sport that is truly open to everyone.” Thomas, who made 100 appearances for Wales, scoring 41 tries, came out as gay in 2009, shortly after he and his wife orced. He moved to rugby league in March 2010, making four appearances for Wales, and retired from all forms of rugby in October 2011.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels fighting the Saudi-led coalition have also been accused of committing war crimes against civilians in the key port city of Hodeidah, now the scene of heavy fighting and where there are fears of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.Britain has consistently said that it keeps all arms exports under close scrutiny and that licensing is made on a case-by-case basis. But now a freedom of information request reveals that for the last five years, Britain has been selling Storm Shadow and Brimstone air-to-surface missiles and Paveway IV bombs to the Saudis under what are known as Open Inidual Export Licences (OIELs), which the government says are for the export of “less sensitive goods”.Unlike specific licences, OIELs allow an unlimited number of consignments over a fixed period, typically between three and five years. There is no obligation to publish the total value of the licence after it expires. “Open licences remove the need for the seller to obtain prior approval for each export,” said Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade, which submitted the FOI. “It’s an opaque system which has been used to shift extremely sensitive weaponry to the Saudi regime.”The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which uses open sources to measure the quantities of arms exported each year, estimates that, since 2013, around 100 British-made Storm Shadow missiles worth £80m, 2,400 Paveway IV bombs worth £150m, and 1,000 Brimstone missiles worth £100m have been sold to Saudi Arabia.“Open licences issued in the years before Saudi Arabia intervened in Yemen’s civil war are still being used for the export of hundreds of millions of pounds of bombs today. If it were not for this Observer report neither parliament nor the committee tasked with scrutinising arms exports, on which I sit, would have any idea that these weapons are being sent,” said Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who sits on the Commons committee on arms export controls.In 2015, the process for issuing OIELs was updated, with a view to encouraging their greater use. The committee strongly criticised the move, claiming it would “inescapably reduce the transparency” of Britain’s arms exports. But the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which at the time was responsible for the Export Control Organisation, the agency that oversees the sale of military exports,insisted that the policy applied to the export of “less sensitive goods to less sensitive destinations.” The government has confirmed that all three weapon systems have been used in Yemen, where Human Rights Watch has linked British-licensed Paveway IV bombs to attacks on civilian targets. In December 2016, Sky News examined an attack site where part of a Storm Shadow missile with UK markings was found.The government insists that it operates one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world with all export licence applications assessed on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria.But this claim was challenged by the arms trade campaigner, Smith. “By the government’s own admission it is trying to encourage more companies to use this type of licence,” he said. “If permission is not needed before a specific export of missiles or bombs takes place, then how can it claim to operate a case-by-case system?”A Department for International Trade spokesperson said claims that OIELs allowed Britain to export arms without close scrutiny were “completely untrue”. “The export of Paveway IV bombs, Storm Shadow missiles and Brimstone air to surface missiles are made under a longstanding government-to-government defence cooperation programme between the UK and Saudi Arabia,” the spokesman explained. “OIELs are not a simple or quick option for exporters and the application process can take several months. Terms and conditions for use will vary depending on the goods and export destinations. Holders of OIELs are subject to audit by DIT compliance inspectors.”"},{"url":null,"title":"summer solstice 2018 longest day pictures","story":"The spectacular moment the sun begins to rise over Stonehenge, Wiltshire this morning as Britain welcomes the longest day of the year. The monument is built along the solstice alignment of the summer sunrise and the winter sunset. Read more about the summer solstice here.Comment: Why England should be a nation of proud flag-waversComment: The lessons I learnt as an NHS whistle-blowerSarah Sanders asked to leave restaurant because she works for Donald TrumpEnglish football hooligans tracked down by police after being filmed in Russian pubExclusive: Moped gang members reveal how they were \u0026#39addicted\u0026#39 to crime - and claim they made £2,000 a dayBaby-boomers face £10k burden to care for elderly parentsEU migration row to relegate Brexit to footnote at Brussels summitFrench fishmongers furious after being handed EU fines for not showing Latin fish namesAustria threatens to reinstate border controls if Germany turns back migrantsSaudi women take to the roads after ban lifts, without the feminist pioneers who drove reformsTurkish opposition implores supporters to protect their votes from Erdogan\u0026#39s efforts to steal the electionLen Goodman: I just can’t understand celebrities who ignore people when they say can I have a selfieArmy of middle class England fans descends on Nizhny Novgorod ready for second World Cup gamePresident of Zimbabwe survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BulawayoIraq \u0026#39kills 45 Isil members\u0026#39 in airstrike on SyriaBoris Becker’s bankruptcy trustees urge tennis star to \u0026#39remember\u0026#39 where his Wimbledon trophies areKim Jong-un introduces new mandatory national oath \u0026#39erasing his father and grandfather\u0026#39 from textWallace Collection founder would be ‘sad’ at closed policy, says Director Comment: From CO2 to Brexit, there is a yawning ide between what we\u0026#39re told and the truthStars of Westeros out in force as Game of Thrones\u0026#39 Kit Harington and Rose Leslie tie the knot in AberdeenshireWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/men/2018/06/14/TELEMMGLPICT000146063662_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450\"","title":"co2 brexit yawning divide told truth","story":"digitalservices@telegraphHow amusing that there is now suddenly a shortage of CO2 to inject into beerOne of the more disturbing features of our time is the yawning gulf between the way some of the most serious issues of the day are generally discussed and reported, and the real story behind them, which too often just gets buried from view.

in the workplace, school and family - and “to forever dedicate their lives as if they were worth nothing but for the great achievements of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il and the Workers’ Party of Korea”.Former North Korean Leader Kim Jong Il shakes hands with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Quoting sources in the North, the media outlet said failing to attend an oath meeting would mark a citizen out as being potentially politically unreliable.The oath has not been changed for more than 40 years, the sources said, although the present hereditary ruler of North Korea has apparently decided that it needed to be revised.The new version of the oath reduces the number of articles from 10 to five, shortening the time required to recite the full text. The revised oaths have effectively edited out Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, leaving only a brief comment on their “will and spirit”, DailyNK reported.Instead, a passage has been inserted that is a declaration of loyalty to the ideology and leadership of Kim Jong-un.The complete white-washing of past leaders has never been attempted before in North Korea and runs counter to the concept of the Kim family being benevolent parent-figures to the population through the generations.North Korean soldiers carry flags and a photo of late leader Kim Il Sung during a military parade Mr Kim’s efforts to eclipse his forefathers is likely to be another attempt to shore up his own domestic support base at the same time as reinvigorating his subjects\u0027 revolutionary spirit. It has also been suggested that it may be part of a manoeuvre to weaken the “old guard” in political and military circles who may have been more loyal to previous regimes.In Washington, meanwhile, President Donald Trump on Friday extended US sanctions on North Korea for another year, citing the “unusual and extraordinary” threat posed by the regime’s nuclear weapons programme.The announcement came 10 days after Mr Trump’s summit in Singapore with Mr Kim, during which the North Korean leader committed himself to the “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean Peninsula in return for US security guarantees. Please review our commenting policyComment: Why England should be a nation of proud flag-waversComment: The lessons I learnt as an NHS whistle-blowerSarah Sanders asked to leave restaurant because she works for Donald TrumpEnglish football hooligans tracked down by police after being filmed in Russian pubExclusive: Moped gang members reveal how they were \u0026#39addicted\u0026#39 to crime - and claim they made £2,000 a dayBaby-boomers face £10k burden to care for elderly parentsEU migration row to relegate Brexit to footnote at Brussels summitFrench fishmongers furious after being handed EU fines for not showing Latin fish namesAustria threatens to reinstate border controls if Germany turns back migrantsSaudi women take to the roads after ban lifts, without the feminist pioneers who drove reformsTurkish opposition implores supporters to protect their votes from Erdogan\u0026#39s efforts to steal the electionLen Goodman: I just can’t understand celebrities who ignore people when they say can I have a selfieArmy of middle class England fans descends on Nizhny Novgorod ready for second World Cup gamePresident of Zimbabwe survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BulawayoIraq \u0026#39kills 45 Isil members\u0026#39 in airstrike on SyriaBoris Becker’s bankruptcy trustees urge tennis star to \u0026#39remember\u0026#39 where his Wimbledon trophies areWallace Collection founder would be ‘sad’ at closed policy, says Director Comment: From CO2 to Brexit, there is a yawning ide between what we\u0026#39re told and the truthStars of Westeros out in force as Game of Thrones\u0026#39 Kit Harington and Rose Leslie tie the knot in AberdeenshireFrance taken to court over no-sex rule for gay blood donors We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/23/TELEMMGLPICT000167027302_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"len goodman just cant understand celebrities ignore people say","story":"digitalservices@telegraphFormer Strictly judge Len Goodman has hit out at celebrities who refuse selfies with their fans as he waltzed with attendees of an Age UK dance class to help tackle loneliness in the elderly.The renowned ballroom teacher last week questioned why celebrities “ignore people” whilst attending the event hosted by Age UK Lewisham and Southwark in a bid to get people up and moving. The 74 year old, who was recently announced as an ambassador for the charity, joined 50 local attendees of the class in Southwark.“I love coming to these events, to go round and meet everyone and I’m not really what you’d call a celebrity,” he said. “I don’t feel like a celebrity put it that way but for what little celebrity status I’ve got if I can come to things like this and meet other people and brighten someone\u0027s day it’s great.“Strictly has given me a chance to give back a little bit of the celebrity status that I’ve got to do good. I just can’t understand celebrities who ignore people when they say can I have a selfie or can you sign this. Any little things I can do for people and their communities I will do.”Len Goodman joined 50 local attendees of a dance class in SouthwarkThe dancing legend joined the charity to support its work in helping older people get the most out of later life. He recently attended Buckingham Palace as part of Prince Charles’ 70th Birthday celebrations where the pair joined forces to help promote wellness in the elderly. The dancer said: “I have never been in Buckingham Palace ever so when I was invited by Age UK I was of course pleased. I went and shook hands with Prince Charles but the school I went to in Bethnal Green - they never told us what to say when you meet a Prince, they never got round to that - but it was charming.”During the dance class on Wednesday Mr Goodman said it was a pleasure to be surrounded by the “unsung heroes” of Britain. He said: “In truth you hear about footballers and celebrities and that getting OBE’s and CBE’s and stuff which is all very nice and good luck to them, but the people that really really add to their communities, people that do meals on wheels or run people to hospital or host events like Age UK - they’re the true heroes. Mr Goodman retired as Strictly Come Dancing head judge after the 2016 series, and despite loving every moment, said it was always better to leave “when the party is still going.”“There truly are so many unsung heroes in our would and it’s a great sadness they don’t all get the recognition they deserve.”He added: “I’m a big fan of all people going ballroom dancing and you get a lot of older people who have maybe lost their husband or wife which can be such a lonely existence and to have places where you can come and dance and interact with others and have a cup of tea.“What’s good with dancing is it’s not only physically good but it’s mentally very good for you. If you’re going to learn a little sequence of steps you have to try and remember those so it’s got many benefits.”Following the event charity director at Age UK said: “It’s never too late to be more active, and seeing Len at a local Age UK dance class will hopefully inspire lots of people to try and keep active as they get older.”Mr Goodman retired as Strictly Come Dancing head judge after the 2016 series, and despite loving every moment, said it was always better to leave “when the party is still going.”“Giving up Strictly didn’t happen on a moment\u0027s thought,” he said. “I just felt I’d done 14 years or however long it had been, and I decided I’d rather leave and people go ‘oh it’s a shame old Len is going’ when the party is still going, rather people people saying ‘gosh is he still on it?’.“I don’t want them going ‘look at him now he’s dribbling’ so that’s where my decision came from.”Mr Goodman also crowned Ed Balls the best worst dancer on the show following his famous rendition of Gangnam Style.Please review our commenting policyGosport nurses first raised alarm over use of painkillers 30 years agoComment: Why England should be a nation of proud flag-waversComment: The lessons I learnt as an NHS whistle-blowerSarah Sanders asked to leave restaurant because she works for Donald TrumpEnglish football hooligans tracked down by police after being filmed in Russian pubExclusive: Moped gang members reveal how they were \u0026#39addicted\u0026#39 to crime -

Resignations seem inevitable as Theresa May\u0026nbspis forced to do what she has so far refused to do -\u0026nbspmake a binding choiceClick to followThe Independent OnlineTwo years on from the referendum and we still have no earthly clue how Brexit will play outA week, as they say, is a long time in politics. Little wonder that the last couple of years felt like an eternity.So, two years after the referendum what, if anything, have we learned about Brexit, and indeed about ourselves? \u0026nbspWell, first and foremost, we’ve discovered that leaving the EU is unbelievably difficult.Untangling 40-plus years of membership was never going to be easy. Doing so under the ridiculous time constraints imposed by Article 50 doubly so. A senior civil servant recalled one of his EU colleagues remarking that Article 50 was written in such a way that only the British civil service would have a chance of getting it done in time.Which points to another lesson. Whoever was in charge of this process, whatever the size of their majority, doing Brexit would have been difficult, all-consuming and messy.And this is so not least because of the choice the EU has presented us with. Michel Barnier’s infamous steps of doom\u0026nbspmean there simply isn’t the room to arrive at the kind of ambitious free trade agreement of which the Prime Minister long dreamed. Rather, the Government must choose between three unpalatable options, or rather two unpalatable ones and an inconceivable one.Whether the Dominic Grieve amendment had passed last week or not, the Prime Minister now realises that no deal is not an option at all.Leaving us with two: a Brexit that is economically ruinous and one that, essentially, equates to membership without the perks.We must, in other words, choose between something that looks like the EU’s deal with Canada (though in all probability a Canada minus rather than a Canada plus) or something resembling continued membership of the single market and customs union.There isn’t much of a half-way house. All the clever talk of a partial single market for goods\u0026nbspis unrealistic. It would be complicated to manage, and does not really help even manufacturers. Rolls Royce, to use the most cited example, make a fair amount of their money from service\u0026nbspcontracts on their goods. Moreover, and not incidentally, the EU has not indicated it would accept anything along these lines.So back to the binary choice. Neither is perfect. Far from it. “Canada”\u0026nbsppresents economic problems. It would mean hardly any agreement over services – the bulk of our economy and the area where we enjoy a healthy surplus with the EU. And it will imply the need for customs checks at Dover. The Prime Minister herself implicitly recognised that such an outcome would be nowhere near good enough in her Mansion House speech.Equally, however, a straightforward “Norway”\u0026nbspsolution, with the UK unambiguously within the European Economic Area, is not one that would work politically here. So the question is whether something substantively similar can be dressed up as something sufficiently different – perhaps with registrations for EU nationals, a hyping up of the emergency brake on migration that the EEA treaty allows and stricter application of EU rules on free movement.This is where the debate now is. Find a clever way of selling the status quo, or adopt a model that impacts severely on trade and hence our economy, and deal with the political consequences.I, for one, have no earthly clue how this will play out. But as this stark choice becomes clearer, and as we approach squeaky bum time, the choice has to be made. Cabinet unity will be stretched to breaking point. Resignations seem inevitable as the PM is forced to do what she has so far refused to do: make a binding choice.And remember this is only a part of the story that has played out since 23 June 2016. The other is not about the EU, but about ourselves.Brexit is happening against the backdrop of a politics changing radically before our eyes. The traditional class bases of support for both major parties seem to be shifting. Hardly surprising then that neither the Tories nor Labour seem sure what post-Brexit offer to make to voters: neither is wholly certain which voters it is trying to attract.This political churn, combined with the all-consuming impact of Brexit on Whitehall, means that little if anything has been done to address the substantive domestic implications of the referendum. And this matters because it is here, rather than in Brussels, that the domestic political battle over Brexit will be won or lost.Whatever her subsequent errors as Prime Minister, Mrs May adeptly captured the mood of the country when she made that striking address from the doorstep of her new residence in Downing Street in July 2016.Brexit represented many things, not least a profound dissatisfaction with the political and economic status quo. Hence the real measure of its impact will not directly be what happens in negotiations with the EU, but how our Government decides to tackle this dissatisfaction. And of course the EU will no longer be there to provide cover for domestic policy failures.Certainly, something more substantive and less dishonest than the “Brexit idend”\u0026nbspfor the NHS is required. What that will be offered, as both major parties flounder, is anyone’s guess.And so, to the final lesson. There is a long, long way to go. We have reached the Brexit foothills. But the real mountains – sorting trade, then, more importantly, sorting ourselves – still await us.

When I did, one asked:\u0026nbsp“Can we pray for you?”I asked why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk the streets of DC\u0026nbspand let God’s voice tell them who might be “broken” or otherwise need prayer.As a Christian, I’m opposed to neither prayer nor people praying specifically for me, at least not when it’s done in good faith.But I’m also a transgender woman, and I was dressed in gorgeous makeup and clothing and earrings. I sure caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.My introduction to Christianity was in evangelical churches. For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities. My own prayer’s acidity served to make them aware of their own by way of spiritual inoculation.The Genderquake debate did more harm than good for transgender peopleWhy has Caitlyn Jenner been chosen to speak about ‘ersity’?These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I’m confident that’s not how Jesus would go about it.There are many in the evangelical community who love and affirm their LGBT+\u0026nbspfamily, friends and fellow human beings.It’s unfortunate, then, that others in the community still must be told a simple truth: They are not doing the Lord’s work by politicising prayer at the expense of others or by dumping their misplaced condescension on strangers they believe to be broken.Prayer should be a loving act, not a weapon of marginalisation.Clymer ia a transgender woman,\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspArmy veteran and\u0026nbsppress secretary at the Human Rights Campaign\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Opponents said it would also unfairly penalise people in social housing, as only they would be liable to be evicted.UK news in picturesDemonstrators at the People\u0027s March demanding a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in London, on the second anniversary of the 2016 referendum.Andria Marsh, 63, holds up photographs of her parents and her original British passport, following a Windrush service at Westminster Abbey in London.

Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded\u0027Mattha Busby and agenciesClick to followThe Independent OnlineEthiopians at a rally in Addis Ababa in support of the new prime minister, Abiy AhmedAt least two people have been killed\u0026nbspand others injured following an explosion at a political rally in support of Ethiopia’s new reformist leader.In a televised address after the blast on Saturday, which eyewitnesses said was caused by a grenade, Abiy Ahmed described the incident as “an unsuccessful attempt by forces who do not want to see Ethiopia united”.He said “a few people have lost their lives” and others were injured in the attack, that came shortly after he spoke to a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters on Meskel Square in the capital, Addis Ababa. Mr Ahmed has not yet blamed anyone for the blast, nor has anyone claimed responsibility, and police are investigating.“Love always wins,” he said. “Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded.” An Associated Press reporter said they saw more than a dozen injured people. Ethiopians have been heartened by a slew of reforms under Mr\u0026nbspAhmed and had come together in a show of support in numbers unseen in recent years in the east African nation. The rally has now broken up with people singing, chanting and going back to their homes. In a cowboy hat and T-shirt, Mr\u0026nbspAhmed had addressed the crowd in Meskel Square as supporters wore clothes displaying his image and carried signs saying “One Love, One Ethiopia”.Mr\u0026nbspAhmed told the tens of thousands of supporters that change was coming after years of anti-government tensions and there was no turning back. “For the past 100 years hate has done a great deal of damage to us,” he said, stressing the need for even more reforms. The 42-year-old entered office in April and went about introducing a swift package of liberalising reforms which surprised Africa’s second most populous country.He announced the release of tens of thousands of prisoners, the opening of state-owned companies to private investment and the unconditional embrace of a peace deal with rival Eritrea. “I’ve never thought this day will come in Ethiopia. I’m very emotional right now,” said Mulugeta Sema, a supporter of Mr\u0026nbspAhmed who wore a T-shirt with the new leader’s image. “We should never get back to dictatorship. This is time for change.” British man held on death row in Ethiopia for four years releasedEthiopia demands Britain return all country’s artefacts held by V\u0026ampAHowever, not everyone has supported the reforms. Some Ethiopians near the border with Eritrea have protested the embrace of the peace deal. Meanwhile, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, the dominant force in Ethiopian government for much of the past 27 years, said the peace deal had been made before the ruling coalition’s congress met to discuss it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He urged Indians to be proud of their culture and history.“The gems of India’s unique heritage, such as yoga, will be respected by the world at large only when we ourselves respect our culture and traditions,” he said.Around the world, public yoga events were held in Afghanistan, Japan and Peru, while Australia and South Africa celebrated on Monday.“From Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions,” Mr Modi told participants on the lush green lawns.“In a world where non-communicable diseases, stress and lifestyle related ailments are rising, yoga can play a central role in mitigating these diseases to create a healthy mind and body.”In the buildup to Thursday’s event, Mr Modi took part in a social media campaign, begun by his BJP party ministers, to get people to share videos of their fitness workouts on Twitter.Celebrities\u0026nbspfrom Bollywood actors to sports superstars\u0026nbspgot involved, and Mr Modi’s own video showed him performing yoga on a boulder in his prime ministerial gardens.Social media was again awash with videos emulating Mr Modi’s on Thursday, including from staff at Delhi airport, pupils at thousands of schools and members of India’s armed forces.Amid questions over his appeal, PM Modi’s party sweeps to key victoryPlea to Indian PM in London for ‘tortured’ captive elephants Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused of spying on citizens India PM makes point of visiting Palestinians after meeting NetanyahuThe Indian navy released pictures of sailors doing yoga on board the world’s oldest aircraft carrier, the INS Viraat, decommissioned last year, and soldiers guarding the world’s highest battleground, the Siachen glacier in northern Jammu and Kashmir state, did yoga routines at an altitude of around 18,000 feet.The events clearly mustered a huge amount of public support. For some, however, there was a sinister edge to having public institutions take part in a scheme closely associated with the prime minister’s messaging. Even prisons were involved, with 15,000 inmates due to take part in yoga events on Thursday in the capital alone.Sagarika Ghose, a prominent journalist and political commentator, wrote on Twitter: “Believer in yoga, try every morning, immense benefits. But concerned: why does a GOVERNMENT need to promote yoga? Yoga’s an inidual choice, a personal option.”Mr Modi’s rule, she said, was “fast becoming an escapist Bollywood film where song and dance attempt to distract from hard realities”. One of the most liked responses to Ms Ghose’s tweet told her to “go to Pakistan” if she couldn’t show loyalty to India.For Ajay Mehra, a political scientist at Delhi University, the International Day of Yoga “has become an imposition”, forced on the people by government.“Something like yoga should not be part of a political project,” he told The Independent, adding that there were certain yogic practices – chanting mantras for instance – that could be offensive to some groups in a plural society, “Muslims in particular”.Mr Mehra noted that Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, stressed the importance of secular, pluralist leadership while also being a devoted practitioner of yoga – “but he didn’t publicise it”.International Day of YogaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

When the downpour finally came, it was worse than anyone feared.In just four days, Cox’s Bazar received two-thirds of the average rainfall expected in the month of June. More than 100 landslides have been reported, several people have died and hundreds of families have been made homeless, forced to sleep in mosques or crowd into shelters with their relatives.Ahead of World Refugee Day\u0026nbspon Wednesday, the UN released a report showing that the number of displaced people in the world has risen to a new record high of 68.5 million, and highlighting the plight of the Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar as one of the biggest drivers pushing up that number.But speaking from Cox’s Bazar in a break in the weather that has coincided with the end of the Ramadan fast, Caroline Gluck, a senior official with the UN’s refugee agency, said their message this year was to “celebrate” World Refugee Day as a tribute to those struggling through such hardship, and the charities fighting to help them.As is the case with the wider refugee crisis across the globe, the population of those displaced in Bangladesh is made up mostly of women and children. Aid workers have found that creating women-only centres for healthcare, counselling and childcare is having a dramatic impact on the Rohingya’s quality of life.Rohingya women and girls are taught sewing, play games, receive medical care and are offered counselling at women-only centres run by charities like IRC in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Jessica Wanless)“In any crisis, women and children are the most vulnerable,” Ms Gluck told The Independent - a problem only exacerbated as flooding and landslides cripple camp infrastructure. “Night-time can be a worrying time, particularly if you have to travel to use toilets. The camp is quite sprawled, and instead of living alongside people you know, you are living with strangers.”One of the charities providing women-only centres is the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Dalia Al-Awqati, IRC’s emergency director in Bangladesh, said up to 80 per cent of the refugees are women and children and in need of “specialised support”.“Many Rohingya women and girls have been raped, seen their husbands and children killed before their eyes and lots of them are facing raising their children alone,” she told The Independent. “They live in a situation that is exacerbated by the presence of stigma and discrimination.”IRC\u0027s women-only centres (Jessica Wanless)For 12-year-old Azara, the centre is an oasis of normalcy in a situation that is anything but, and a welcome break from the boredom that comes with living in a refugee camp.She said she came to the centre every day, finding a safe space where she can make friends, play games and engage in her favourite pastime - henna.“It feels like home,” she said. “We come straight after we have been to school. Every week there is at least one day for sewing. Every week we learn something new. We love to learn.”Ex-UN ambassador says \u0027destroying Rohingya exceeds costs\u0027 for MyanmarRohingya facing \u0027crisis on top of crisis\u0027 as world looks other wayRohingya say Myanmar singled out the educated in genocideArmed Rohingya group massacred Hindus in Myanmar, report alleges\u0027Bittersweet\u0027 Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced to flee their homesMs Gluck said centres like those run by the IRC were vital to encourage women “carrying the burden” of what happened to them in Myanmar to come forward and seek counselling and support, in what is traditionally a very culturally conservative society.Media reports have previously highlighted a spike in births nine months after the alleged brutal crackdown by Myanmar’s army in Rakhine state that forced the Rohingya to flee. The danger, Ms Gluck said, is that all pregnancies in the camp become stigmatised as potentially being the result of rape.And one of the biggest positives to come out of the creation of the centres has been the number of female volunteers working to foster new communities in their makeshift home.A lot of women are taking on jobs as safety volunteers or in counselling their fellow refugees directly, having received training from NGOs. “It has helped women to develop roles that they didn’t have back home,” Ms Gluck said.Senwara stands in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Timothy NesmithIRC)Senwara, a 35-year-old mother of four, is a volunteer who helps spread word about the centre to other refugees. She became the only female “Majhi” or community leader in her area of the camp after helping distribute food aid, and sees promoting the centre as part of her responsibility.“Women come here to this centre because there are no men,” she said. “If there were men, families would not let teenagers or women giving birth come here because they would feel shy. They are serious about this matter.”Ms Gluck said the few days of good weather, plus celebrations around Eid, had brought “joy to many faces” in the camps. There is an upbeat mood also to coincide with World Refugee Day, with singing, volleyball and other competitions put on to showcase the best of life in the camps.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya

He added: “Unfortunately, you need to keep Italian Roma in Italy.”The country\u0026nbspis estimated to be home to between 100,000 and 180,000 Roma.The minister’s actions drew criticism from human rights groups and opposition politicians.“The way is short from a census to a concentration camp.

I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.”Producers have not yet explained how Barr’s character will be written out of the show.However, The Hollywood Reporter cited sources that claimed Barr will retain all rights to her Roseanne Conner character – plus any future spin-offs beyond The Conners or any future reboots of the original.In a joint statement, Goodman, Metcalf, Gilbert, Goranson and Fishman said: “We have received a tremendous amount of support from fans of our show, and its clear that these characters not only have a place in our hearts, but in the hearts and homes of our audience.“We all came back last season because we wanted to tell stories about the challenges facing a working-class family today.We are so happy to have the opportunity to return with the cast and crew to continue to share those stories through love and laughter.”The stars recently signed new one-year contracts for the spin-off that will keep them at the same salaries, believed to be around $300,000 (£230,000) an episode, according to Deadline.Announcing the spin-off, ABC said: “The Conners stories demonstrate that families can always find common ground through conversation, laughter and love.The spin-off will continue to portray contemporary issues that are as relevant today as they were 30 years ago."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415382034.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"st pauls girls school hammersmith london austerity day baked potato lunch","story":"St Pauls Girls School in Hammersmith, West London, was accused by a former pupil of showing utter contempt with the exercise that resulted in money going to local charities.The prestigious school, which counts Susanna Reid and Rachel Weisz as former pupils, usually serves the likes of seared cod, slow-cooked Moroccan lamb and duck leg confit, appeared to delete a post on Twitter about the austerity lunch.The post, which was screen-grabbed and shared, said: Today was the final Austerity Day of the year.Students and staff had baked potatoes, with beans and coleslaw, for lunch, with fruit for dessert.The money saved will be donated to the schools charities.The post included pictures of the food described, as well as an image of what appears to be the arm of a butler or waiter lifting a lid from a platter containing just three peas.Henna Shah, 24, a former bursary student at the school, said: I am incredibly grateful to have gone to a school that has given me opportunities someone like me would never have had otherwise.Yet I recognise that few people like me get the chance to have an education like this on a bursary scheme like I did.I am highlighting this now because this is not about pulling the ladder up behind me - I joined the Labour party and work in politics now precisely because everyone deserves the best quality education.It is upsetting to see that on a day that is meant to be about compassion, the way it was presented showed utter contempt.Austerity is not about eating jacket potatoes once a term, it is about not being able to afford anything else.A menu on the school website, for a week in May, gave a flavour of what is usually on offer for lunch at the school.Pupils tucked into delights such as Malaysian snapper Curry with okra and tomato, warm chicken and asparagus Caesar Salad, and plum and blackcurrant sponge.According to the schools website, the fee per term for the academic year 2017-2018 is £7,978, and for new entrants to the senior school (Year 12) the fee per term is £8,577.The school fee includes lunch, the website said.Susanna Reid - TV presenterA food section on the website says: Everyone knows teenage girls can be picky eaters, so we try to give them lots of choice.We regard the enjoyment of good and healthy food as a priority and lunch at St Pauls is a real highlight of the day.In a statement, the school said: For many years, along with many schools and places of worship in the country, St Pauls has arranged regular lunches when simple food is served and the money saved given to local charities.The aim is also to raise the awareness of our students to those less fortunate than themselves.We take our commitment to the wider community very seriously.The choice of the word austerity is to draw attention to the fact that others around them are facing significant economic difficulties.A Twitter account called @everydayhunger wrote: Can they really be unaware that for families living in poverty today, this austerity meal is completely out of reach?Maybe they should visit their local food bank to see what genuine poverty rations look like.Twitter user Georgia OBrien wrote: One of the countrys leading independent schools holding an Austerity Day where students eat what is basically amounts to a standard state school dinner."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004151362811.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"treasury official behind brexit leak","story":"The civil servant quit when he realised he had been fingered by a major Whitehall inquiry.He released details of the 27-page market sensitive government analysis in January that predicted the UK would be worse off outside the EU under every exit scenario.The damaging leak threatened to undermine Theresa May’s Brexit negotiations as the impact assessments were unfinished.

They’ve far too much to discuss among themselves.”Migration is plunging European politics into crisis again. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition is threatening to break apart over the issue.While in Italy, the new government is threatening to close its southern border — blocking migrant rescue ships from landing — and open its northern border, encouraging illegal migrants and asylum seekers to head north to Germany and Sweden.So worried is European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that he is hosting a mini-summit tomorrow to try to find a solution to the migrant crisis which can help save Merkel’s political career.It is tempting to look at the EU in crisis and say that is why the UK is leaving. But this crisis is making it more difficult for Britain to get a reasonable Brexit deal.The European Commission is running the Brexit negotiations.Its priority is in defending the theology of the European Union, rather than finding practical solutions. As one leading figure in the Government laments to me, Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier “won’t budge off CETA (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) with Northern Ireland stuck in the customs union”.This kind of Canada-style free trade deal is regarded by the Government as inadequate.Mrs May and co have long hoped that the member states, nearly all of whose economies would be hurt by such a limited agreement, would intervene at some point and tell the Commission to engage more constructively with the UK. But this is happening all too rarely.One of the reasons is, in the words of one member of the Brexit inner Cabinet: “Only four national capitals are fully across Brexit.”Many of the countries that are most sympathetic to the UK don’t have the capacity to follow all of the issues concerned.Over the past few years, the key to any deal in Europe has been Merkel. She is not now going to ride to Britain’s rescue— as David Cameron found to his cost in the renegotiation.But the German Chancellor could push the Commission towards a slightly more pragmatic approach.However, she is now trying to keep her own governing coalition together, as well as come up with a deal with the French for eurozone reform, leaving next to no time for Brexit.I am told that when Brexit is discussed in meetings she is “visibly distracted”, turning to aides for advice far more frequently than she does on other issues.This situation is one of the many reasons why the Government should have prepared vigorously for no deal: A credible threat to walk away from the table if the Commission didn’t behave in a reasonable fashion would have got the member states’ attention.But Mrs May now must hope the EU can patch together some deal on migration and that the member states begin thinking seriously about what kind of post-Brexit relationship they want with this country.WHEN the Cabinet gathers at Chequers next month to thrash out the UK’s offer to the EU, one of the most contentious issues will be customs.The Brexit inner Cabinet is split between those who favour a so-called “new customs partnership” (NCP) with the EU – which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs after Brexit, with companies receiving a rebate if their goods stayed in Britain rather than heading to the continent – and those who advocate Max Fac, which would use technology to minimise border checks.Two Cabinet working groups are trying to find a way to make these ideas work. Neither group has had a decisive breakthrough yet. But I am told the Max Fac one is “not a million miles away” from a solution.The challenge for the PM is to make these plans acceptable to her own side, including David Davis and Liam Fox. One Brexit inner Cabinet member tells me: “She’s got to have David and Liam. If she doesn’t have them, then she has no solution.”Both Davis and Fox support the Max Fac option. But there are influential figures in No10 who remain convinced that NCP is the option to go for. They argue only NCP can help deal with the Irish border issue and get the Government through next month’s crucial Commons votes on the customs union. They warn: “No NCP, no Brexit.”The fear among Brexiteers is Mrs May will use this Chequers meeting to try to push through a modified version of NCP. They fear the reason the whole Cabinet will be present on the second day is to give Mrs May the numbers to do this if the Brexit inner Cabinet remains split on the issue.Doing this, though, would be extremely risky. It would leave Mrs May with a policy that neither her Brexit Secretary nor her International Trade Secretary support.THE Chancellor and the Defence Secretary aren’t just split over how much money the military should get, but what it should be spent on, too.One Cabinet ally of Philip Hammond’s complains that Gavin Williamson wants to “spend the money on uniformed officers when he should be spending it on robotics and the like”.Their view is that this would be a better response to the 21st-century security challenges Britain faces.But in truth, Britain needs both conventional and new, hi-tech forces if it is to respond to the variety of threats now out of there. That is why we MUST spend more on defence.Those close to Williamson point out that if the Government doesn’t increase the defence budget, our status as the leading military spender in Europe – upon which so much of our influence in the world depends – will be under threat as the French and the Germans increase their military budgets.NEXT week, Theresa May will give a speech setting out the Government’s post-Brexit industrial strategy.Key to this must be artificial intelligence, an area where we are one of the leading nations in the world.I understand that the importance of maintaining the UK’s edge in AI is what led to Mrs May accepting Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Digital Secretary Matt Hancock’s argument that visa rules for tech entrepreneurs must be relaxed.The countries that succeed at AI will end up defining this century.So any deal with the EU must preserve the UK’s ability to regulate these industries of the future in a way decided by us, not Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is staggering that the ­Government is still undecided on ­fundamental principles.But the Tories’ woes were hugely exacerbated by their election calamity, caused in part by Remainers hoping Labour would betray Brexit.That emboldened diehards in the Lords and Commons — operating alongside the lavishly-funded, slickly orchestrated campaign colluding with Brussels to annul the biggest vote in our history.Meanwhile the national conversation has degenerated into a tsunami of hate, chiefly from sanctimonious Remainers branding Leavers uneducated racists.How much better off we would all now be if on June 24, 2016 they had grudgingly accepted defeat and pledged instead to make the best of Brexit.In fairness, some Remainers did. TV’s Richard Madeley spoke for them recently when he said we now had a duty to see it through in full by leaving the single market and customs union.He was right. To pretend that Brexit can be “softened” to honour the substantial Remain vote — a nightmarish fudge which Boris Johnson warns of today — is simply dishonest. There is leaving and there is remaining. That’s it.Brussels has revelled in Britain tearing itself apart. Now it is sidetracked by its own problems. A deal looks miles off.Theresa May has only one path forward. At next month’s pivotal vote, she must defeat the backbench rebellion hoping to shackle us to a customs union restricting our trading future. That is not Brexit, as voters would quickly realise. It would reignite the Leave ­campaign with unprecedented ferocity.And the PM and her Cabinet must not be derailed by Remain-fanatic businesses muttering about pulling out. Previous such threats have proved bogus, like all those dire economic forecasts.Leaving may not be smooth in the short-term. That must not deter us.When the EU finally realises Brexit in full is inevitable maybe they will stop playing games and agree a deal.But if the Remain resistance succeeds in crippling Brexit, it will bring on chaos.Our current divisions will seem like happy hour. And it will be their fault.HEARTBREAKING, isn’t it, to see Argentina in disarray and the Germans wobbling at the World Cup?

which can carry up to 60 planes.It is staffed by around 650 crew and can travel more than half way around the world before needing to be refuelled.Her sister ship is named HMS Prince of Wales, and is the eighth to bear that name.In August 2017, the colossal vessel was pictured during her sea trials off the coast of Scotland, alongside USS Donald Cook, USS Philippine Sea and the colossal American carrier USS George HW Bush.Experts reckon the ship is expected to remain in Portsmouth for resupply for a couple of weeks, until being deployed to the US later this summer.HMS Queen Elizabeth set sail from the Rosyth dockyard in Fife on June 26.The 65,000-tonne carrier passed under the iconic Forth Road Bridge, then spending several weeks in the North Sea for sea trials.She arrived in Portsmouth Harbour on August 16, 2017, sharing the message home on social media as it came into the naval base.Captain Jerry Kyd said he felt a huge amount of pride ahead of the vessel berthing in her home port.On November 22, 2017, HMS Queen Elizabeth returned from the second period of sea trials.The giant ship made port in Portsmouth on June 23, 2018 after the latest Helicopter Sea Trials.The Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier had a leak so serious it may need to go back into dry dock at Rosyth — for repairs that will cost millions.A faulty seal around one of the vast warship’s propeller shafts meant 200 litres of sea water poured in every hour.Sources said at the time there was a “significant” defect with the stern seal, an inflatable rubber ring that fits around one of the propeller shafts.The problem was spotted during sea trials.It reportedly had the fault when it was delivered by ship building partnership the ­Aircraft Carrier Alliance, which could mean they will have to pay for the repairs, not the Ministry of Defence.The aircraft carrier spent six weeks in the North Sea for sea trials.During the trip, the aircraft undertook handling and speed tests off the east coast of Scotland.The Queen officially welcomed the UK’s new £3.1billion aircraft carrier into the Royal Navy fleet and declared it the “best of British”.Her Maj arrived on board HMS Queen Elizabeth in an elegant purple outfit, at Portsmouth Naval base on December 7.She underwent sea trials with Chinook and Merlin helicopters in March 2018.The two helicopter type trials were carried out in tandem, ensuring the time available on deck was used to maximum effect and avoiding a second voyage out to sea later in the year.It is due to head to America’s east coast for F-35 flight trials which will begin in October 2018.The HMS Queen Elizabeth will be declared as having a full operational capability in 2020.During her estimated 50-year working life, HMS Queen Elizabeth could be pressed into action for various work such as high-intensity war fighting or providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief anywhere in the world.Each aircraft carrier will provide the armed forces with a four-acre military operating base, which can be deployed worldwide.When the ship has its full complement of 36 F-35B fighters and four helicopters on board the crew will increase to about 1,600.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

June 21, the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, is the longest day in the year - affording us approximately 17 hours of daylight. Technically, this also means that the nights will start drawing in again now - so there\u0027s really no time like the present to get out and explore the great outdoors on some of the country’s most breathtaking bike rides. We\u0027ve taken a look around the UK to find the best places to watch the sun setting.  1. Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, Fraserburgh, Scotland   A small village called Maud in Aberdeenshire offers a starting place for a traffic-free cycle to the coast. If you\u0027re in the mood to learn then head to the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses in Fraserburgh. The sun will set at around 10.12pm this week in this part of Scotland, so you\u0027ve got loads of time to enjoy the start of the summer.  Bike need replacing?       If your existing bike needs replacing, you\u0027ll want something efficient and speedy for the roads - like the Carrera Parva Hybrid bike , which comes in versions for both men and women and is now just \u0026pound210 (a saving of \u0026pound90).  And if you don\u0027t need a new bike, why not have yours checked over before setting off. Like any mode of transport your bike needs to be looked after and regularly checked for wear and tear.  Halfords offers a 32-point Free Bike Check which includes:   Frame, saddle and handlebar Wheels including tyres, rims, spokes and hubs Brake system including levers, calipers, pads and cables / hoses Drivetrain including gears, levers, chain, bottom bracket, cranks and cables   2. The Eden Project, Cornwall      Why not spend the day enjoying the amazing sights at the Eden Project? Best of all, if you arrive by bike you\u0027ll get a discount on entry. The sun sets on Eden at around 9:30pm on the solstice. Bear in mind though that the Eden Project shuts at 6pm, so you\u0027ll need to watch the sun go down somewhere nearby.   Get there in style on the Carrera Subway 1 Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound300. With easy to use 24 speed Shimano gearing, your effort for building speed will be minimised on all terrains, while its lightweight aluminium frame means you can quickly and efficiently ride to your destination.   Camping out?      Planning to camp? Be sure you book in advance as you won\u0027t want to be without a pitch.  Croft Farm Holiday Park is just a mile from the Eden Project and three miles from the beach.

Nel Williams is now a thriving ten-year-old who loves playing the piano, watching football and performing on stage - but while her mum was pregnant, her life hung in the balance.  Kate was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer in 2005 after spotting a large lump after her armpit, but after a lumpectomy and a mastectomy, she was told it had spread.   Her only option was intensive chemotherapy, which severely affects fertility, Wales Online reports.   But despite being under the cosh of cancer-beating drug herceptin Kate discovered she was expecting her third child – one of just a handful in the world known to have conceived during such arduous treatment.   “It was all absolutely terrifying,” said Kate, 47, who lives in Penarth, Wales. “We went for a scan at four weeks and in the middle of this big, black abyss we were staring at this bright, beating light which was her heart. “My husband, Huw, said at the time that she ‘deserved a cuddle’ so we made the decision to stop my chemotherapy. “We didn’t know what the condition would be of the foetus or whether she’d be disabled when she was born but she’d survived this far so we wanted to give her a chance.” Kate said she knew she was taking a huge gamble by coming off herceptin during pregnancy but her oncologist assured her she was in good physical shape and responding well to treatment.  “It was quite an agonising decision because I was running the risk of my two other children losing their mum,” she said. “But the staff at Velindre Cancer Centre, as well as my midwife who’d been there for the delivery of my two other children, were fantastic.” Daughter Nel was born at their former home in Pontcanna, Cardiff, on Tuesday, October 23, weighing a very healthy 8lbs 9oz. “They monitored her throughout the pregnancy and she was growing fine,” Kate added. “The only thing she had ‘wrong’ with her was having just one kidney but that’s not an irregular occurrence.” Nel, a pupil at Albert Primary School in Penarth, has now decided to shave off all her hair for Velindre Cancer Centre in honour of her mum and nan Susie Beer who has stage four breast cancer.

Akinyemi Adigun, 35, convinced a woman in her 70s to give him almost \u0026pound10,000 which he promised to pay back. But Adigun, of Moston, Manchester, never repaid the money and stopped contacting the victim after he had drained her life savings. Now Adigun is facing jail after he was found guilty on Friday by a unanimous verdict of possessing criminal property following a trial at Warwick Crown Court.  He had told the victim, who had lost her husband three years earlier, he was called Dr Marcus Harry and was a British medic working in Nepal.  Prosecutor Daniel Wright told the court the victim, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, fell for Adigun after joining a dating website for widows in September 2015. He said: She found herself getting lonely and, at the suggestion of a friend, she joined a dating site for widows. She was contacted by \u0027Dr Marcus Harry,\u0027 who said he was a 50-year-old male from Bristol who was working overseas in Nepal. They hit it off, and within a month Dr Marcus Harry starts to ask for money from her. At first these were small amounts. It began with a request over WhatsApp, asking her if she would mind getting him \u0026pound50 of iTunes vouchers which he said he was unable to get hold of in Nepal. She agreed, and bought a \u0026pound50 voucher at Argos in Leamington before photographing it and sending the picture to him by email. Two weeks later Dr Harry told her he was planning to fly back to the UK on October 17, but was unable to get hold of the \u0026pound1,000 he needed for the flight - so she agreed to send it to him on the basis that he would repay it on his return.

For many youngsters Bobby Moore and his team’s triumph marked a high point in their love affair with the beautiful game.  One of them was Dave Roberts. But there is something that makes his story of dedication to a team a bit different.  Now it has been made into a film \u0026shystarring comic Alan Davies and Martine McCutcheon – plus young Game of Thrones \u0026shyactor Brenock O’Connor.  Every fan knows the occasional pain of crushing disappointment. But week after week, Dave experienced little else. In the late 60s his team Bromley FC were in such a state that Dave would turn up to every game with his football boots, in case they were a player short. They conceded so many goals the \u0026shyopposition would lose track of the score. In their most dismal season, 1969-70, they won only three matches out of 40. But nothing could dampen his \u0026shyenthusiasm. Bromley were one of the last genuinely amateur teams left and fighting for survival in the lowest non-league \u0026shydivision. And Dave was always on the \u0026shysidelines cheering them on, no matter what.  He was Bromley’s most \u0026shypassionate fan and – five decades later – he still is. Now 63, his dedication has been \u0026shyrecognised on the big screen. It has not all been tears and despair. Dave told us: “This year is the first they’ve been fairly good and it’s disconcerting.” And in March he finally got a taste of what England fans felt in 66 when Bromley made it to Wembley. They reached the final of the FA Trophy – non-league teams’ equivalent of the FA Cup.  A dream had come true. Dave said: “It was the biggest Bromley game of my \u0026shylifetime. I felt my whole life was unfolding a bit. But there\u0027s no happy ending.” Bromley’s opposition Brackley FC equalised in the final 20 seconds of the game, forcing a penalty shoot-out. True to their club heritage, Bromley lost. Dave said: “I was told after we missed the final penalty I sank to my knees \u0026shyshouting, ‘Noooo.’ “And there may have been a tear. My wife Liz thought that was ridiculous.”  Dave’s unwavering love for his home team, nicknamed The Lillywhites, led to him write the book The Bromley Boys. It chronicles his endless trips to the team’s Hayes Lane ground and supporting the worst football team through their abysmal season of the late 1960s. In the film he is portrayed by Brenock, who was Olly in Game of Thrones. Martine and Alan Davies star as his parents. Its premiere to 1,100 people at Wembley was just four days after Bromley lost the final. Dave, who now lives in Menston, near Leeds, said: “It was bittersweet going back and I had to tell myself it was for a completely different thing that had nothing to do with our loss. “But the film seems to strike a chord with audiences. People do react with laughter and enjoyment.” At the age of 11 he listened to the World Cup final on a radio while travelling to Lund, Sweden, on a ferry.  His parents had refused to cancel the family holiday. He said: “I sulked all the way, getting more and more seasick as I listened to the match on a radio. I was so happy when they won I danced on this rocking ferry. I’m not sure anyone understood why. As a boy he begged his mum and dad to take him to football matches. His father Edward, who died in 2016 aged 96, occasionally took him to Fulham matches. Dave, whose mum is also dead, said: “I was \u0026shyconvinced Dad loved \u0026shyfootball as much as I did. “I only found out later he absolutely hated it. He was doing it so we could spend time together.” His parents wouldn’t let him go to watch a London team because he was too young.  But they allowed him to go to his local team Bromley – in Kent in the 60s but now a South London borough. Dave said of the team: “They were \u0026shyabsolutely useless in those days. The first season I watched them was their worst season in history – they lost endlessly. But I got the bug.” He once ran away from boarding school to watch a meaningless evening game and had to walk nearly 20 miles back having spent the bus fare on tea. He said: “At 3.15am I was scared and hungry when a car pulled up. The driver opened the window and called my name. It was Dad. “He’d been driving round for hours \u0026shytrying to find me. I got in the car and promptly burst into tears.” Another time, despite Bromley losing their last 13 games, Dave, then 14, hitched to a match because he was determined to see every fixture.  Afterwards Bromley’s star striker Alan Stonebridge , Dave’s hero, gave him a lift home. “I never wanted that journey to end,” said Dave, a dad-of-three. “My bedroom was covered in pictures of him.”   At 16, Dave spent \u0026pound50 on a red three-wheeled car so he could offer other fans lifts to and from matches. But he recalled: “Within five minutes I had done a triple somersault in it after taking a corner too fast and had to go back to cadging lifts.” These are the anecdotes that \u0026shyinspired The Bromley Boys book in 2006. He said the book is very niche and has been called “wilfully uncommercial” which made turning it into a film “even stranger”. He said: “But the story has heart and soul. It’s about flawed relatable people who have found their place in life. “There are lots of books about \u0026shysupporting popular sides but what about the rubbish non-glory teams and the people who go and watch year-in year-out with absolutely no reward.” To this day, aside from some years living in New Zealand and the US, Dave never misses a game.

Colin Douglas was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in October, but by April was declared cancer-free and he and his family were overjoyed. But on May 20 he was given devastating news: he had secondary cancer and it spread to his spine, lymph nodes and lesions. Weeks later, on June 11, he was dead.  Now his family have paid tribute to the fighter and say he made everybody laugh until the very end, the Hull Daily Mail reports.  Annette Shreeve, Colin’s partner of almost three years, said: “He was still making us laugh right until the very end, and he had a great relationship with the staff at Castle Hill.  “I knew him for almost three years but it wasn’t long enough.” Colin, of Bilton Grange, east Hull, was a driver for disabled children but his main loves in life were snooker, cars, fishing and, most importantly, his children. “His children were everything to him,” said Colin’s close friend Carl Gibson. “He was so proud of them and they meant the world to him. “He had several hobbies but I can’t stress to you how much he loved his snooker. I’ll never forget the time I asked him to take me and a friend to Skirlaugh and you could tell he really didn’t want to but he was having kittens, when we got in the car and he realised I had asked him to give Jimmy White a lift. “His life was snooker but he was also really into cars and fishing. He had planned to go sea fishing this year, and he was so excited. He had a fraternity with him no matter what his hobby was.” Colin’s love was so great for snooker he taught his son Josh to play, with a touching final picture of the pair showing them as runners up in a recent tournament. “He won so many trophies and he taught me how to play,” said Josh, 22. “He was so fun-loving and was never down. “His other love was drag racing and anything to do with cars. He would go on trips away with other car lovers.” Josh’s sister, 19-year-old Jordan Douglas, added: “He was very fun and brilliant, and could make games out of anything. You were never bored when you were around him.  “I called him Hulk because he was so strong and tall, he was 6ft and weighed nearly 19st. Everybody was really proud of him and loved him.” Colin’s younger sister, Jacqueline Douglas, said: “He was a pain in the backside when we were younger, just like any brother, but he was so protective and made me the person I am today. “I couldn’t have asked for a better big brother. He lived in the same house for 21 years, and the neighbours all grew to love him as well. “He was the perfect neighbour and would always help anyone out if they needed anything changing or looking at. They’re all just as shocked as us that he has died, and I think Colin was the only person who came to terms with what was going to happen. “He was so young and we all were certain he would get longer.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how last victoria cross holder","story":"NewsHow last Victoria Cross holder \u0027Big Bill\u0027 hurled rocks and beer cans to keep the North Korean army at bayBill Speakman died aged 90, 66 years after he fought off a sustained attack from 6,000 solders for more than four hours with a shrapnel wound in his leg\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLaura Connor21:08, 22 JUN 2018Updated21:10, 22 JUN 2018NewsVictoria Cross holder Bill Speakman with his medals (Image: REX/Shutterstock)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe only living Victoria Cross holder from the Korean War has died at the age of 90. War hero Bill Speakman was just 24 when he fought off a sustained attack from 6,000 Chinese and North Korean solders for more than four hours in 1951, despite receiving a shrapnel wound in his leg. The 6ft 6in soldier, known as ‘Big Bill’, pelted enemy soldiers with grenades until they ran out. He then hurled rocks, tins and even empty beer bottles at them. He was given a hero’s welcome by thousands of people on the streets of his hometown of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, when he returned a year later. Speakman became the first man to receive a Victoria Cross from Queen Elizabeth II for outstanding bravery, and was one of only a handful of living holders of the award.  Despite his great height and courage, he was known as a modest and quiet man who struggled to adjust to civilian life and the celebrity which followed his great investiture. Born on September 21, 1927, Bill was raised by a single mum and started his military career when he was 17, serving in Germany, Italy and Hong Kong with the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland. He transferred to the King’s Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB) as a private when British troops mobilised for Korean service in 1950.  His regiment was bombarded with shell and mortar fire in the early hours of November 4, 1951 as they defended a position on Maryang San in Korea, but Speakman fought back with grenades and beer bottles sent to the line for consumption by the platoon, breaking up several enemy attacks. His charge against the enemy allowed his overrun troops enough time to evacuate their wounded. Talking of the life-or-death seige, he said: “It was hand-to-hand. There was no time to pull back the bolt of the rifle. “It was November, the ground was hard, so grenades bounced and did damage.”  Recalling the moment he was handed the award, he said: “When I got it The King [George VI] was alive but he was very ill. “He awarded me the VC and then he died. So The Queen – I was her first VC. It was a wonderful moment. I think she was nervous and I was very nervous.” The announcement of the Victoria Cross award said: “Private Speakman’s heroism under intense fire throughout the operation and when painfully wounded was beyond praise and is deserving of supreme recognition.” "},{"url":null,"title":"identical twins parents thought autism","story":"NewsIdentical twin\u0027s parents thought he had autism or anxiety - but it turned out to be something far deadlierSid Earley was diagnosed with a brain tumour after doctors initially dismissed his symptoms - but now the seven-year-old is being supported by his identical twin brother Mac\u0026nbspShareByNathan Standley15:15, 23 JUN 2018NewsSid with his brother Mac while in hospital\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email An identical twin whose symptoms were shrugged off as anxiety or autism was later told he has a brain tumour.  Sid Earley began missing school due to headaches and bouts of vomiting, but doctors said his symptoms were nothing to worry about. But the seven-year-old\u0027s concerned parents, Alex and Simon, noticed his eyes started to turn inwards and flicker, and he developed coordination issues, so they took him to the optician.  It was then, on June 5, that Sid was sent for an MRI scan, and his parents were told he had a huge tumour on his brain, reports the Liverpool Echo.  Sid’s aunt Robyn Dunbar, 33, said his parents were devastated and have been “living in a bubble” ever since the diagnosis.  She added: “They’re just completely in it at the moment, it’s so hard. They want to get in touch with people who have been in similar situations, people who might know about it and maybe help point them in the right direction. The couple, from Prenton, Wirral had to sit and wait as their little boy underwent 10 hours of invasive brain surgery to remove the tumour, which had been pressurising his facial nerves, causing sight and coordination difficulties. Although the surgery was successful, the aggressive nature of the tumour and the microscopic cancer cells remaining in his brain meant there was no option but to send him abroad for potentially life-saving proton therapy treatment, which is not available on the NHS.  So Robyn set up a JustGiving page to raise funds to help pay for the treatment and support Sid and his family. In under one week, over \u0026pound10,000 has been raised. Robyn said: “We just want to say a massive thank you to everyone that’s helped us, we don’t think we can say thank you enough.” The money will also go towards helping Sid’s twin brother Mac travel with his brother to support him during his treatment. Mrs Dunbar said Mac had been hit particularly hard by Sid’s illness. She said: “They’re like peas in a pod, they couldn’t be closer. They absolutely adore each other. “Mac spent every night in Sid’s bed while his brother was in hospital. ‘Super Sid’, as he has become known on his aunt’s JustGiving page, has since been discharged from hospital and will be treated as an outpatient while he waits for his treatment to become available.

Police investigating the clip served three men with notices under the 1989 Football Spectators Act. Michael Herbert, 57, appeared at Leicester Magistrates\u0027 Court on Saturday, where he was handed a five-year football banning order, the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council (NPCC) said. Two other men, aged 52 and 58, appeared at Leeds Magistrates\u0027 Court, where the case was adjourned until Tuesday. Last week, the Football Association condemned the video, which appeared to show two men giving Nazi salutes in a Russian bar in Volgograd.  The southern Russian city, which was the venue of England\u0027s 2-1 win over Tunisia, was formerly known as Stalingrad - the site of one of the bloodiest battles in history when Soviet soldiers repelled Hitler\u0027s army during the Second World War. Last Wednesday, a spokesman for the FA said: We strongly condemn the actions of the people in this video.

But one mother has spoken out about the dangers of children consuming sugar, during a debate on Good Morning Britain about obesity. Nutritionist Tonia Buxton appeared on the show on Friday morning where she revealed that her own children were banned from eating sugary foods. She went on to say that they weren\u0027t even allowed to enjoy a slice of birthday cake at a party. The mother-of-four argued that sweets are as addictive as cocaine and would only leave youngsters craving another hit.  She said: Sugar has the same effect on the brain as cocaine. It\u0027s a hit and once [children] have it, they go crazy, they\u0027re running around. Then they come down and they want more. You\u0027re better off not having any, and then having something that\u0027s better for you. Tonia argued that in today\u0027s society people no longer need to eat sugary foods to survive, as there were so many other healthy options.  She then brought out a cake made of courgette and cardamom as an example of the kind of alternative \u0027treat\u0027 she allows her children to tuck into. Parenting expert, Amanda Jenner, appeared alongside Tonia on the show.  She disagreed with the nutritionist\u0027s opinions, saying that in \u0027moderation\u0027 the odd sugary food was fine for kids. The televised debate followed the news that one in 10 parents don\u0027t let their children have birthday cake at parties to prevent them from becoming overweight. GMB viewers were incensed by Tonia\u0027s comments and took to Twitter to share their own thoughts.

But a getaway to Australia for a family wedding turned into a bit of a nightmare for a mother from the UK.  A woman, going by the name Ashley W, shared her story on Netmums , revealing how she had spent \u0026pound4,000 on flights for her family to attend her cousin\u0027s wedding down under.   But when they arrived, her family told her she would have to find a babysitter for her five-month-old daughter as children weren\u0027t invited.  The mum says she had known about the nuptials for a year and during that time no one had mentioned that her baby wouldn\u0027t be welcome at the ceremony.  It wasn\u0027t until the official invitation turned up three weeks before the big day, that she discovered there was going to be a problem. By this point it was too late, as she\u0027d already booked flights for her family. She said: My cousin invited us to his wedding in Australia with 12 months notice. Sent us an email with the date no further info. My daughter is five months old. So my family said we would attend and we bought the flights.  She added: I chased for the actual invitation about 100 times and eventually it arrived three weeks before we flew. The invite said no children. I flagged that they really should have mentioned this before I bought the flight. When they arrived in Australia, her family weren\u0027t impressed that she had brought the child along and suggested she find a babysitter. She continued: Am I being unreasonable to think it\u0027s a joke they can\u0027t make an exception for a breastfeed baby flying from England?  Don\u0027t have kids at your wedding, no problem. Don\u0027t make me spend \u0026pound4k on flights and accommodation to be told that my baby can\u0027t come. Other mums commented on the post that they would be furious if put in a similar position. One user said: OMG that\u0027s ridiculous! You\u0027re flying to the other side of the world... I personally wouldn\u0027t let strangers look after my child. I\u0027d be fuming too! I totally get the no child thing, I really do, but this is definitely an exception.

Sarah Haywood gave birth to Mila by emergency cesarean in 2010 and discharged from hospital two days later, despite warning signs such as a high temperature.  But just two weeks later, she had a stroke after her cesarean wound became infected, and has been left unable to do simple tasks or care for herself.   University Hospital North Staffordshire NHS Trust was later found liable for causing Sarah\u0027s stroke and she received an interim payment.  But Sarah is still waiting for a final settlement which will allow her to move into suitable accommodation and pay for the equipment, care and therapy she needs.  She has had to quit her job as a retail manager, suffers with strength and mobility problems down her right side, and has difficulties with her speech, memory and coordination. Now Sarah - who is supported by 44-year-old partner, Mirko Budimir - is determined to regain her independence. Sarah, of Baddley Green, Stoke, said: “The stroke has had a huge impact on my life - and even things like getting dressed, brushing my teeth or making myself a hot drink are a problem.  “Sometimes when Mila wants to do something I can’t do it with her and I feel broken inside. Whenever we want to do something as a family we have to think ahead and look at how practical it will be. “I try to keep upbeat and do my absolute best to get on with life the best I can. Mirko helps me more than I could ever ask or hope for he has been amazing.” Sarah gave birth on September 17, 2010 and regular monitoring revealed she had a high temperature and an increasing heart rate. She was discharged on September 19. But she went to her GP on September 22 when her wound became infected and was given antibiotics, returned to the hospital three days later to have the wound drained and was back again on September 28 for a consultation. She suffered the stroke on October 3. Her lawyers successfully argued that if Sarah had remained in hospital for further tests it would have highlighted her infection and allowed her to have antibiotics sooner and avoid the stroke.  Sarah added: “It is hard to get over the fact that a failure to take a few reasonable steps has caused so much damage and turned my life upside down. I try to keep upbeat and do my absolute best to get on with my life. Mila is my saviour and my whole world revolves around making the most of life with her and Mirko.” The family is represented by specialist medical negligence lawyers Irwin Mitchell. Lawyer Jenna Harris said: “Sarah was badly let down in the standard of care she received which meant she experienced a life-changing moment for all the wrong reasons.

Ex-Wales Dragonhearts full-back Scott Bessant is still unable to walk, talk or recognise his family and is still in hospital - but his condition has improved.  He was found seriously hurt with multiple fractures to his skull, a fractured neck, broken ribs on his entire right side, a fractured pelvis, and has since had multiple strokes.  Mr Bessant was placed in critical care and remained in a coma for several months, but he has finally woken up, Wales Online reports.  Mr Bessant’s brother-in-law, Neil Chere, 48, said: We are in a position now where we want to be able to take him out of the hospital. At the moment he is just restricted to the hospital grounds.  We\u0027re hoping that different surroundings and places that he knows might help with his recovery. Scott was in a total coma but he\u0027s now awake. He still can\u0027t walk and talk, and he may not be able to recognise us, but it is an improvement.  Mr Chere said doctors are now working with Mr Bessant to see if he is able to communicate.  Doctors have been showing Mr Bessant images and video, and even throwing a balloon at him, to see if he reacts to any stimuli. Mr Chere said: There is a buzzer he can press if he does but we have not seen much response with that.  We have been talking with the doctors and this getting him out and showing him places he might recognise could help. Mr Bessant, from Talywain, was drinking in the Little Crown pub on the night before he was found by a passerby near a bridge in Pentwyn Lane. According to those with him he was in a “happy, joyful mood” and was dancing and left after the pub closed.  Mr Chere said: “We think he walked up the old line [a disused railway line] but as of yet because nobody has been able to confirm that we’re not sure. “That was on his way home. It could take you about an hour to get to where he was. “From the time he left the pub until 5am in the morning we don’t know where he was.  “All we know is that at 5am a member of the public who was going to work found him.” In 2009 amateur player Mr Bessant – then the top scorer for Newport Titans and having appeared twice for Wales A – was invited to train with Super League side Celtic Crusaders and hoped to turn professional. But dad-of-two Mr Bessant, who had scored on his international debut against Scotland the previous year, was unable to attend training after contracting salmonella. Mr Chere said: “He’s a doting dad. The most loving, caring person you could know. He’s a gentle giant. He’s the sort of person, and I know it sounds old-fashioned, but if there was an old lady crossing the road he’d go and help them. “And whatever happened nobody deserves what he’s going through. And it’s not just that it’s the knock-on effect on the family. The family believe the community\u0027s continued support comes from Mr Bessant\u0027s popularity. Mr Chere said: You have got to remember that Scott was a very loved person. Then you look at his sporting career. We have had Welsh players contacting us about what happened. He was 100% a popular guy. And I think that when people read his story from the beginning they find it heartbreaking.

Chris Cook, 27, wanted to get a trim so he would look smart for work but instead says he was left looking like an absolute idiot. He said the cut along with a beard trim cost \u0026pound10 and called it garbage in video ranting about his new Jim Carey-inspired style. When Chris\u0027 usual salon was busy last Friday lunchtime, he instead decided to visit Smart Cuts in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, for a \u0027short back and sides\u0027. The former infantry soldier claimed he left looking like his hair had been cut using a bowl. However salon owner Faz, who declined to give his surname, said they are experienced barbers. Faz said any unstyled hair \u0027is going to look horrible\u0027 and that if Chris was unhappy he should have returned to the salon to get the \u0026pound5 cut rectified.  Chris, from Cleckheaton, said: I woke up cranky on the Saturday morning and when I caught sight of myself in the mirror I couldn\u0027t believe what I was seeing. I had a really long fringe and looked like Lloyd out of Dumb and Dumber. I just thought \u0027what the hell have they done to my hair? I can\u0027t go out looking like this\u0027. It looked like a bowl cut. Once my mum stopped laughing at me I said to her \u0027you might as well have put a bowl round my head and saved me \u0026pound10\u0027. Cleaner Chris filmed a video raging about his barnet and posted it on social media. In the video he can be seen holding his phone to his face and lamenting his locks.  Chris can be heard saying: Right guys, went down [to] Cleckheaton yesterday for my hair cutting. I went down to Smart Cuts, [it] cost me a tenner, look at the state of this. Give me a little shave on the beard as well that\u0027s why it was a tenner. Short back and sides and a trim on the top, that\u0027s all I asked for. Now you can see it there, look at the state of that. So if you want to look like Lloyd off Dumb and Dumber and pay a tenner for it, get yourself down to Smart Cuts, absolutely garbage.  Two days later his trained hairdresser aunty Janene Crossley, 47, spent 20 minutes blending the style and Chris said he is now starting to see the funny side of it. Chris said: When I first shared the video there was no funny intention, it was just to show people. Next thing I know people are commenting and liking it and phone wouldn\u0027t stop pinging for two days, everybody was laughing at it. Chris said the hair cut fiasco started when he tried a different barbers for the first time. The dad of two said: I normally go to a different hairdressers but the one I usually go to was busy and there weren\u0027t a lot of people there. I tried this barbershop instead and went in for a short, back and sides. I don\u0027t tend to style my hair, I only do that when I go out. I just keep it kept cut short and neat so that it looks good at work and brush it to the side. I was in there for about 15 minutes and as he was cutting and shaving round the side of my head he kept brushing it into the style I have, it looked nice and neat. When I got home later that day I had a shower and the following day got up early and that\u0027s when I saw what it looked like. I just couldn\u0027t believe my hair, they\u0027d messed it up. My mum\u0027s not a professional but she could have done a better job with a bowl. I looked an absolute idiot.

Temperatures could reach 35C from Wednesday in parts of the country next week, forecasters say. The UK will be warmer than 28C in Tahiti, French Polynesia, as even the north braces itself for all-time record 31C highs. A weather map for Thursday shows the hot high-altitude air in orange and red.  After a marvellous Midsummer\u0027s Day tomorrow at 27C, the Met Office forecasts 30C by Tuesday and highs of around 33C on Wednesday and Thursday.  But up to 35C has been predicted for the south by The Weather Outlook as high pressure builds and hot air blows in from Spain, as seen in the weather map.

Computer models show 35C isn\u0027t out of the question from midweek as temperatures continue to rise amid a Spanish plume of warm air. Temperatures could reach higher than Britain\u0027s hottest day since the 36.7C on July 1, 2015, at Heathrow, London, recorded by the Met Office.  The Met Office said Northern Ireland could break its 30.8C all-time temperature record, set on June 30, 1976, at Knockarevan in Co Fermanagh, and July 12, 1983, at Shaw\u0027s Bridge, Belfast. Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: It\u0027s already warm in the south and will be hot and sunny everywhere in the UK by Tuesday, with high pressure. Midweek could see the low 30s - so 30C to 33C - in the south. And it will be hot right up to the north of the UK, with a chance Northern Ireland could beat its all-time maximum temperature record of 30.8C.

It was the worst thing that could have happened to the family of little Jocelyn and her parents were absolutely devastated. In November 2017, the tot, affectionately known as Jossie, was diagnosed with high-risk neuroblastoma – a rare form of childhood cancer. Over the months, Jossie, of Skegness, Lincolnshire, has received cancer treatment on the NHS and will soon have surgery to remove her tumour and be starting radiotherapy and immunotherapy. But sadly, this type of cancer has a high-chance of returning, and mum Cassie Leaver, 37, says survival is just 10%.  “It was absolutely devastating,” she said. “It’s the worst thing to happen as a parent to hear your daughter has cancer. “It’s something I never thought in a million years would happen to our family. “It’s a clich\u0026eacute but it always happens to other people. “To be faced with this, with a 10-month-old baby at the time. It brings challenges not just in the short-term but the long-term is huge.” She added: “We take our lead from Jossie. She’s a very cheerful little girl. We lead by her example to get through this.  Jossie’s family are fundraising to get the four-year-old to America for further extensive treatment, with the hope it could prevent chances of the cancer returning. The community of Skegness has been rallying around for little Jossie, with Cassie’s family and old school friends running events, taking part in head shaves and organising a charity ball. But one close friend of hers, Claire Draper, has gone one step further by vowing to swim 14-miles of the Wash to raise \u0026pound5,000.  “Cassie is a good friend who I grew up with in Skegness and have known for 20 years,” Claire told Lincolnshire Live.   “Jossie, who loves unicorns, hotdogs and superheroes, was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer late last year. “She has just spent the last seven weeks in Great Ormond Street Hospital having intensive radio and chemotherapy and before that endured 80 days of chemotherapy. “It is down to her family to raise the money to pay for the life-saving treatment which will cost hundreds of thousands of pounds. “There are many incredible fundraising events taking place, and I wanted to do something that would really encourage people to dig deep for this beautiful little girl.” Claire will attempt to ‘Swim the Wash for Joss’ on August 6 (weather permitting) - a gruelling 14 miles across the North Sea from Hunstanton to Skegness - a feat that has not been attempted since the 1970s.

Monalisa Perez, then 19 and pregnant with her second child, was advised by Pedro Ruiz, 22, he would be shielded by a thick book as she took aim from close range. But the stunt went horribly wrong and the bullet went straight through the 1.5-inch book and into Ruiz\u0027s chest, fatally wounding him. Dramatic footage newly released shows him encouraging his terrified girlfriend to pull the trigger, with a bullet inside he says can travel the length of three football pitches. In a transcript of the moments leading up to the shooting, Perez says: “Babe, I’m not doing this, I can’t.” “I don’t want to be responsible,” she adds.   But according to local reports , Pedro tells her: “You won’t as long as you hit the book, as long as you hit the book you’ll be fine. Come on. The batteries gonna die on it. Come closer.”  Before she pulled the trigger, transcripts showed she said: I can\u0027t do it babe. I\u0027m so scared.  Babe, if I kill you what\u0027s gonna happen to my life. Like, no this isn\u0027t okay, she continued, the Daily Mail reports.  Eventually Perez pulled the trigger that ended Ruiz\u0027s life. Ruiz had introduced the video by saying his YouTube channel would have crazy stuff in it. Here I have my girlfriend Monalisa to help me out with my first video, a video shows him saying. So babe, let\u0027s go ahead and show them what we have in store, he said as she showed off a 50 caliber desert eagle gun placed on a red cushion.  He explains in the clip that he\u0027s going to ask Perez to \u0027clip the button\u0027 and she looks at him nervously asking is it hard to which he replies no, it\u0027s a button. It\u0027s basically a canon in your hand going off, he describes. Ruiz shows off how big both the gun and the bullet are in the footage. He says if he snaps his fingers the bullet could travel more than three football fields in length.  The point of this video is I really want to see if a 50 caliber bullet can go through a book, he says. I\u0027m going to stand behind it, and Monalisa is going to shoot it, hoping she hits the book. Hoping she hits the book and not me, but the most trustworthy person that I trust in this world is my girlfriend, Monalisa, so if I\u0027m going to die, I\u0027m pretty much ready to go to heaven right now. If I die I\u0027ll be ready for Jesus. He probably won\u0027t accept me into the gates because of how stupid this is but I have confidence my girlfriend will hit the book and not me.

Yep, you read that right, hot dog water - that\u0027s water that has been used to cook hot dogs in. The unusual beverage had a great selling point, as Douglas claimed it would help people to lose weight, make you look younger, increase brain function and improve vitality.

The fine print on the flyer debunked the stunt, saying: Hot Dog Water in its absurdity hopes to encourage critical thinking related to product marketing and the significant role it can play in our purchasing choices. According to Douglas, there were some people who figured out that it was all fake, but others didn\u0027t have a clue.

The lifeguard spots the distressed girl and dives in to help in the nick of time, rescuing her on a float and dragging her to the poolside.  Moments earlier, the little girl could be seen using her feet to try and stay above the surface. She also reached for her face, as if to plug her nose to stop herself from inhaling water. Other swimmers nearby seem oblivious to what is happening, which according to water safety experts is common, with half of children who drown dying within 25 metres of a parent or other adult.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29b42d531-435x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc four of the very best to have pulled on dark blue","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor what is a mid-sized club by Scottish standards, over their history it’s fair to say Dundee have punched well above their weight when it comes to producing and attracting top talent.In today\u0026#8217s look down memory lane, as we celebrate their 125th birthday, we highlight the very best of what has been a quality crop.Billy Steel: However long there is a Dundee FC, no list of the club’s greatest performers will ever be complete without the name Billy Steel.When director/manager George Anderson snapped the Scottish international inside-forward up from Derby County for a record £22,500 in September 1950, it went down as one of the transfer coups of the decade.Regarded as world class but known for being difficult to manage, Steel repaid the faith Anderson had shown in him and, in the next four years, would inspire Dundee to two League Cups.Steel left Dens in 1954 when he quit the senior game aged just 31. He moved to America where he died in 1982 but, 36 years later, remains regarded as one of Scotland’s greatest players.Claudio Caniggia: It was a case of 1950 and Billy Steel all over again when, in October 2000, Dundee sent tremors through the football world by announcing the signing of Argentine World Cup star Claudio Caniggia.In desperate need of a replacement for injured striker Fabian Caballero, the Dee’s Italian manager Ivano Bonetti used his Serie A connections and fixed up Caniggia, a former Roma team-mate of his brother and assistant Dario.In the end, the man who was Diego Maradona’s favourite strike partner for Argentina did not stay long at Dens Park, making just 21 league appearances and scoring seven goals, before heading for Rangers at the end of the 2000/01 campaign.Both for his performances and the gentlemanly way he conducted himself off the park, the impact he had on Dundee was considerably greater than the time he spent at Dens Park.Alan Gilzean: If there’s a debate over who the best-ever Dundee player is, when to comes to putting the ball in the net there can be no argument.Although down the years the club can boast some prolific scorers, there never has been, and is never likely to be, anyone who could match the ability of the legendary Alan Gilzean.Over 40 years after his playing career with the Dark Blues and then Spurs came to an end, those who saw him or played with or against him still regard him as being a world class centre-forward.Born in Coupar Angus, Dundee were his first senior club. He score an unequalled total of 169 goals for them and won the league in 1961/62 before being transferred to Spurs, where he enjoys similar legendary status, in 1964.Doug Cowie: The sands of time mean in some ways he is the forgotten man of Dundee greats but never to those who saw or played alongside Doug Cowie.Signed by George Anderson in 1945, over the next 16 years the Aberdonian would make a record 446 appearances, win two League Cups and also appear in two World Cups for Scotland.Cowie left Dens at the end of the season before the club won the championship but many of those who played in the side that clinched the title have often referred to the influence he had over their development on the pitch.As well as nurture it, Cowie would go on to show himself as an adept talent spotter. Once his playing days were over he worked for Dundee United and, along with fellow-scout Davie Small, was credited by Jim McLean as being instrumental in unearthing many of the local players who went on to bring the league flag to Tannadice in 1983.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.741936.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc humble claudio caniggia was even better off pitch barry smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee legend in his own right, Barry Smith captained the club for nine years before returning as manager in 2010.During that time he saw some of the best and some of the worst times in the history of the club.Among the best, however, was playing alongside some top-quality team-mates.And one name that stands out is Claudio Caniggia.Barry said: “I grew up watching guys like him play in World Cups, so I feel really fortunate to have played with Caniggia.“What made him stand out is, no matter how much he had done in the game before, he was so humble and had great humility.“What stood out for me is how he took time to help out the younger lads in training. Guys like Steven Milne and Graham Bayne owe a lot to him.“That was just the type of guy he is, very humble, no airs and graces and he took a lot of time with younger players that a lot of other players wouldn’t.“The first time he came in, he immediately made sure he was part of the team.“He didn’t just stand around, he got involved straight away.“Claudio didn’t want to be a superstar or anything, just wanted to be part of a team. His attitude was superb.“A lot of players could take a lesson from him. Every day he knew he still had to work hard.“I remember him as much off the park as on it because he was so good on the training ground.”Barry had another name he’d stick into the mix from his time at Dundee.“Georgi Nemsadze was the most technically gifted player I played with,” he added.“I knew when I won the ball, I could give it to him no problem.“I was very lucky to play alongside him.“I have to say, those guys did what they did because there were other guys in the team doing their jobs.“Guys like Lee Wilkie, Gavin Rae and me were the workhorses for the team and we allowed the players with all the flair to go and do their stuff.”As manager, Barry had to deal with some of the darkest times at Dens as the club headed into a second administration – the people at the club, however, managed to turn that time into one of the best at Dundee with the ‘Deefiant’ season.He added: “I do believe if the team hadn’t stayed up someone would have shut the doors at Dens.“Collectively everyone responded, the coaching staff, office staff, players and definitely the fans rallied around the club.“Though it was a really negative time, we turned it into a positive one which then led to promotion the following year.“I don’t like to single anybody out but Robert Douglas played a massive part.“It’s difficult to say just how much he helped gelling the players together.“All the players and their wives and families were invited round to his all the time and that really generated the team spirit.“He really made sure the team was a real team and that’s not even talking about what he did on the park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b7163e9578-397x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc jocky scott recalls winning league cup against celtic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn their 125 years, Dundee have five major trophies in their cabinet and, with almost 45 years since they last lifted silverware, it shows just how difficult it is to be top dog.Just like today, back in 1973, when the Dark Blues lifted their last trophy, managing to battle past the Old Firm was one of the biggest hurdles.Dundee legend Jocky Scott was part of the 1973 League Cup-winning side and says meeting Celtic in the final, rather than the semi, gave the side a completely different mindset going into the game at Hampden.Between 1969 and 1977, Dundee lost five Scottish Cup semi-finals to the Hoops. However, the one time they met them in a final they ran out 1-0 winners in December 1973.Jocky said: “The team that won the League Cup was a very good side.“Unfortunately, we couldn’t do more in the Scottish Cup because we kept meeting Celtic in the semi-final – we just couldn’t beat them.“When Rangers and Celtic are dominant, it’s very difficult. You’ve got to catch them on a bad day or get them in a final where you are on a hiding to nothing and just go out and play.“A semi-final is the worst game of all.“You’re within touching distance of the final but you’re not there yet.“Some players don’t handle that too well but then can handle a final.“Around 1973, we’d played Celtic in a few semi-finals and they were all very close games.“We were never really hammered in any of them but they just had that wee bit more experience of playing in semi-finals and winning them.“We had experience of losing semi-finals.“Psychologically that’s a big thing, whereas when you get to a final it’s different.“We were, obviously, the underdogs – with that there’s nothing to lose, just go out and play, do your best and hope it’s good enough.“You need wee breaks, too, and we got them.”In the midst of the miner’s strike, the 1973 final was an eerie affair with just 27,974 spectators braving the snowy conditions.Striker Gordon Wallace got the all-important goal late on to secure the trophy for the Dark Blues.Scott added: “Rab Wilson played it up to Gordon Wallace.“He had Pat McCluskey at his back but he took it down on his chest and in one movement hit it low into the corner.“The goalie was taken by surprise with the quickness Gordon hit it.“It was a typical striker’s goal, instinctive, didn’t think – bang.“We scored and went ahead – I don’t think we did that in any of the semi-finals we played, we were always having to fight back. We scored first and had something to build on.“It wasn’t like we scored and sat back and defended for 60 minutes or we were fortunate or anything.“We’d had a go at them, played well in defence and attack. It wasn’t a smash-and-grab win, we deserved it.“We were good enough to go on and win more trophies but, unfortunately, we didn’t. It was a good side with good players, individually and collectively.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715bb7ee0-788x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc the big days in dark blues history books","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most provincial clubs, for Dundee, trophies are a welcome bonus, not a given.In their 125-year history, the Dark Blues have lifted major domestic silverware on five occasions, though not since their League Cup win of 1973.Their first success came 17 years after the club was formed, in the shape of the 1910 Scottish Cup – the only time they’ve lifted the country’s most prestigious knockout trophy.In typical fashion, the one time Dundee did win it, it was the hard way.The first round saw them held by Beith, technically away from home but actually at Dens Park after the opposition surrendered home advantage, before winning the replay 1-0.A crowd of 20,000 then saw them take care of Falkirk at the first time of asking and it was the same with Motherwell in the third round.In the semi-finals they needed three games before beating Hibs by the only goal of the entire tie at Parkhead.That set up what was to be an epic final against Clyde, the side who would finish just above them in the First Division that season.Game one of an Ibrox triple header ended in a 2-2 draw on April 9 and, when the teams met again seven days later, there was no scoring.Dundee were finally able to kiss silver for the first time on April 20, 1910, when goals from Jimmy Bellamy and John ‘Sailor’ Hunter saw them edge out the Bully Wee by 2-1.That sparked off wild celebrations and although that second replay was a midweek game, the team were mobbed when they arrived back home by train late in the evening.Despite a few near things, it was to be 41 years before the fans were able to welcome another trophy to the city.That was when the side put together by director/manager George Anderson, and that was inspired by Scotland inside- forward Billy Steel, went all the way in the League Cup.Having edged out Hearts in the group stage, they beat Falkirk 2-1 over the two legs of the quarter-finals. A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/976302492.jpg-279x180.jpg ","title":"argentina cant expect messi to carry them says dundee hero caniggia","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee star Claudio Caniggia has urged the current Argentina side not to be a one-man team in Russia this summer.The Argentines got their World Cup campaign under way on Saturday against Iceland but could only manage a draw.Today they face Croatia and will hope to kick-start their campaign.Caniggia went to three World Cups – almost returning for a fourth at the age of 42 in 2010 – and arrived to much fanfare at Dundee in 2000.He says his country’s best chance of winning it all for the first time since 1986 is if Lionel Messi’s supporting cast step up to the plate.The 51-year-old rose to international prominence during the 1990 World Cup in Italy alongside Argentina great Diego Maradona and insists the difference between that side and today’s is the expectation on the other players.Caniggia said: “Messi doesn’t get the same support from his team-mates Maradona did.“I knew Maradona was the complete footballing genius but I didn’t think about keeping up with him. Never.“Every player has a responsibility, even those who don’t play much.“You can’t give all the responsibility to Messi, because then what’s the point of you being there?“Imagine if I’d thought in 1990 the world champions had to carry me through. No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"convincing players to come to dundee united has not been easy admits csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits getting the players he wants to rebuild Dundee United this summer has not been easy.But he’s revealed the more quality signings that have been made, the less difficult the process has become.With other clubs, often from top divisions, also keen on players like Callum Booth, Craig Curran and Frederic Frans, the Tangerines had to pull out the stops to persuade them to sign up at Tannadice.That saw Csaba making a point of speaking to every potential target individually, rather than doing business through their agents.“If we are in the Premiership it is easier to attract staff and players, but we are not,” he said.“I have talked to every single player we have signed to convince them to come to Dundee United.“It was not an agent calling them to tell them Dundee United were interested, it was the manager calling to say you are important.“I think this was a reason why we’ve got players.

This will be Neil’s second year in charge and just like everything else he has a specific style he wants to play.“I think we saw, I would say, more than glimpses of it last year.“It is a style of play I think is entertaining to watch.“We have a very good young base to build on and I think if we build on that base it will be very exciting next year.”The 2017/18 campaign ended with a degree of disappointment as the Dark Blues fell short of their target.A ninth-placed finish kept them in the division and, with a year’s experience as a manager under his belt, Nelms is backing Neil to succeed with “just a few more pieces of the puzzle” needed to push Dundee to the top table in Scotland’s top flight.The American added: “Once again he can build on last season and with just a few more pieces of the puzzle we have quite a good picture going forward.“With what we’re doing with players at the moment and getting ready for pre-season, it seems like the season ended a week ago and all of a sudden we’re back.“This is the busiest time of the year for us, we are trying to get players in and do things to bolster the team and really get ready for the upcoming season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29ce2188d-453x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united boss csaba wont rush fyvie back early from serious injury","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo could wrap key midfielder Fraser Fyvie up in cotton wool for part of Dundee United’s pre-season build-up in a bid to make sure he’s fit for most of next season.Fyvie, who signed a new two-year contract recently, is still battling back from a serious knee injured that forced him to miss the second half of last season.And while the 25-year-old is keen to start full training when the new-look United squad report for work tomorrow after their summer break, Csaba may ease him back.He’s even prepared to see Fyvie miss the opening weeks of the season to make sure he’s 100% ready when he does return.“I hope, of course, he is ready soon but if by the end of September he is on the pitch I will be happy about it,” said Csaba.“He’s made a huge development. He is already OK and he wants to begin but I want him to take it a little bit easier because we want him for the long term, not two weeks.”Another of United’s long-term absentees from last term, James Keatings, will definitely be working with the rest of the squad right from the off tomorrow.The former Hearts and Hibs man has been out since early January because of a groin problem that required surgery.He’s been working over the summer, however, and is on course to be ready for the big kick-off next month.“Keatings is OK. Every second day he sends me a message saying I want to be training,” added Csaba.Still on the injury list are goalkeeper Deniz Mehmet and defender Lewis Toshney.Deniz will be out for several more months after his recent knee operation that followed the freak injury he suffered in the play-off win over Dunfermline last month, while Toshney’s condition will be assessed in the next week or so.He has yet to play under Csaba because of a knee problem that’s ruled him out since last October.“The one we don’t know how far on he is and is still in the recovery process is Toshney.“He’s made good steps forward but we have to see how the knee will react.”With eight new players and four fresh appointments to the coaching staff, there will be plenty new faces when the squad reports to their St Andrews training base tomorrow morning.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2cf82a90d53-374x564.jpg ","title":"end of an era as iconic dundee chip shop to close after 64 years","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn iconic chip shop is set for the “last supper” as it closes for the final time after 64 years.Dora’s Fish and Chip shop on Dura Street, which has served thousands of customers since opening its doors in 1954, will close for the last time on Saturday June 30.Owner Giulio Dora, 65, said his parents Peter and Matilde bought the shop after a “gentleman’s agreement” with Mr Forte, then proprietor of Forte’s Cafe.But now Giulio, who grew up in Stobswell, is retiring after first entering the chipper at the age of one.He served his first customer when he was nine and learned the trade from his parents, who also had premises in St Mary’s, Broughty Ferry and Barnhill.In his time he has served the great and good both living in the city and passing through – from jute mill workers to Dundee FC legend Bobby Cox, wrestler George Kidd and pop idol Donny Osmond.After a brief spell as a mechanic, Giulio returned to the family business in 1979, before buying the premises in 1981.He said: “This hasn’t been a sudden decision.“We will be sad to leave the customers after all their years of business, as well as the delivery drivers who have come in and out with our supplies over the years.“The Dora family has been associated with fish and chips for about 130 years since the family moved here from a village in Italy called Rovinaglia.“We have so many great memories of our time here.“The former Dundee United manager Jim McLean used to come in and check the players weren’t eating fish and chips after training.”Giulio added: “I’ve been amazed at the reaction from customers to us closing.“We had some Brownies come in recently and they told me I couldn’t retire – I was welling up. I’ve worked 14 to 15-hour days as far back as I can remember and must have cut up thousands of tonnes of spuds in that time.

I was not expecting that and it ripped the heart out of me.“We always look forward to coming to Inverbervie every year.

National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing

The connection with the charity came about because Andrew is father-in-law to a friend of Emily Crossley, a former reporter and anchor for Channel 4 News and CNN International, who co-founded the charity in 2012 after her son Eli was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. (DMD)Emily has advocated for patients around the world and spoken many times in the Houses of Parliament.The trust raised \u0026pound3.5million in its first three years, and then six years ago started the annual Duchenne Dash, which with big sponsors such as Maserati, brings in millions for research and also raises awareness of the horrible disease. Last year\u0027 Dash raised \u0026pound1 million.DMD is an inherited genetic disorder passed on by the mother that leads to progressive muscle degeneration and weakness.

emissions and carbon footprint, which has a direct positive impact on clean air in the region.\"The council is very supportive the national Clean Air Day campaign, and is raising awareness of this important issue with staff and the wider community.\" He added: \"The council is making a conscious effort to reduce vehicle emissions by increasing the number of electric vehicles in its fleet, and has recently launched ultra-low emission car club vehicles at many of its offices.\"This scheme will help many staff to move away from using their own cars for council business, which should further help reduce our overall footprint.\"In addition, we are encouraging active travel and lift sharing to reduce emissions from commuting journeys and to encourage fewer vehicles to travel to the same locations each day.\"We will also be raising awareness about the importance of reducing vehicle idling, especially outside schools.\"Saturday 23 Jun 2018 8:35

It hasn\u0026rsquot worked. We need to bring about a cultural change whereby owners take greater care and pride in their properties.\"I believe this will need to be supported by legislation which makes it compulsory for buildings to be checked regularly.\"He suggested surveys every three years, adding: \"We\u0026rsquove spent years in and around Inverness trying to persuade the owners of buildings to act responsibly and it hasn\u0026rsquot worked.\"\u0026nbspHighlands and Islands MSP Mr Stewart was successful in having legislation revised four years ago to allow local authorities to recoup money they spend on serving notices or for work carried out if a building is deemed dangerous.In January, kiltmakers Duncan Chisholm and Sons in Castle Street was served with a dangerous buildings notice by Highland Council and the local authority appointed contractors to make the building safe. It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs. But a crisis incident could not only injure people but affect their insurance and their reputation.\"A council spokeswoman said: \"We regularly remind building owners that the responsibility for ensuring the safety of members of the public in and around their buildings lies with them \u0026ndash whether commercial, retail, business, public or privately owned.\"The new maintenance guide can be downloaded at https://academystreet.org/Saturday 23 Jun 2018 8:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"dons announce ticket allocation for burnley clash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen have been allocated 2,400 tickets for the away leg of their Europa League tie with Burnley.The Dons will take on the Clarets in the Europa League second qualifying round.The first leg will take place at Pittodrie on Thursday, July 26 with the return on Thursday, August 2 at Turf Moor with tickets available for 2,400 Dons fans.Both matches are provisionally due to kick-off at 7.45pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rooney staying at pittodrie says aberdeen manager mcinnes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen boss Derek McInnes today confirmed star striker Adam Rooney will not be leaving Pittodrie this summer.​Rooney had been left out of the Dons’ starting line-up in the post-split games last season with Championship Dundee United reportedly keen on securing the 30-year-old.McInnes has also met former Rangers striker Kenny Miller recently in Florida.Rooney is the first Don to hit 20 or more goals in three consecutive seasons since legend Joe Harper in the late seventies.McInnes insists he is here to stay.He said: “Adam has two years left here and has always been a very important player for me.“He will continue to be an important player.“Adam and I work closely together.“You don’t work closely together this length of time and not build a close relationship.“Adam will be here.”Prolific striker Rooney started just 22 games last season.However, he still finished the campaign as the Reds’ joint top scorer on 11 goals, level with midfielder Kenny McLean.Scotland international McLean has now left Pittodrie to join parent club Norwich City in the Championship.January signing Sam Cosgrove, secured from Carlisle United, was the preferred striker in the final games of last season.McInnes said: “If Adam Rooney wants to be here – he is here.“And we want to work with Adam as he is a big player for me.“Obviously, like every player, Adam wants to play week in, week out.“Hopefully, Adam and others will keep looking for those improvements in their game that will help make that a reality.”Dundee United were recently reported to be keen on a move for Rooney who is contracted to the Dons until summer 2020.

Leadership and direction of the school needs to be well supported through a strong emphasis on professional development.”Referring to the nursery, Ms Gow said: “Staff were unaware of the health conditions and wellbeing needs of some children.”This, said Ms Gow, meant children would be at risk as staff would not know how to react in an emergency.Inspectors had previously expressed concerns the playground was in a poor state and the boundary gate was insecure and, though the gate had been temporarily mended, it still was not adequate to keep children safe.“The provider had advised the area was to be made safe during the summer break,” said Ms Gow.“The design of the toilet cubicles and mirrors and their proximity to the play room and the cloakroom meant children’s dignity and privacy was not respected,” said the report.It added: “A glass panel on the door meant children’s dignity and privacy was compromised during nappy changing. The provider has advised a partition wall would be erected during the summer break.”The council’s head of education Andrew Griffiths: “We have been working with Fraserburgh North over a period of months to provide guidance and support with the aim of improving standards, and this report highlights there is still much work to do. We know parents, carers and staff may be concerned by the issues raised and we will be keeping them informed of the action being taken.”It is understood the head teacher at the time of the inspection is no longer in the post and an acting head is in place.An Aberdeenshire Council spokesman said: “During their visit, the inspection team identified a ‘caring environment and positive relationships between staff and children’ and ‘happy children who are eager to learn’, along with good teamworking and good quality teaching.“But the team also identified major weaknesses in the leadership and have called for improvements to self-evaluation and to the school’s approaches to equality and diversity.“A timeline for improvements has been identified, and we have developed an action plan to ensure these are all met by the end of August.”He added: “Work has been undertaken to ensure staff are fully informed about children’s medical history, that appropriate plans are in place in case of emergency and that staff are fully aware of how to implement these plans. A new management approach has also been established.“By August, the council will ensure the security of boundaries, improve the design and layout of the toilet cubicles, and make sure all staff have necessary training.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"accident bankfield roundabout causing rush","story":"NewsAccident at Bankfield Roundabout causing rush hour delaysTraffic is tailing back along the A77 and Dalmellington Road.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet08:59, 21 JUN 2018NewsBankfield Roundabout\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn accident at the Bankfield Roundabout is causing rush hour delays.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"School library petition almost reaches target in first week","story":"A PETITION calling for librarians to be returned to three Borders high schools

Lowood Bridge has reopened ahead of schedule.\nThe B-listed 250 year old crossing, which links Galashiels and Melrose, was closed for 20 weeks between January 31 and June 15 for an essential and major repair and strengthening programme.\nDespite the early stages of the project taking place during the most extreme winter weather seen in recent years, the bridge reopened before the start of Melrose Festival Week.\nExtensive masonry repair works have taken place during this time which required significant scaffolding to be in place for a number of weeks, resurfacing of the road surface on and around the bridge has been carried out and the traffic light system upgraded.\nAll these works, which have been carried out by Borders contractors, also mean that Lowood Bridge\u0026rsquos 26 tonne

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people.

While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"United front to boost the Borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year. Views were sought on the Borderlands\u0026rsquo key themes: Digital Energy Destination Borderlands Rural Productivity Business Growth Transport Innovation and Skills and Quality of Place.\nThe conference had backing from both governments who have pledged support for a deal.\nKeith Brown MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made clear our support for a proposed Borderlands deal in our budget statements. And we look forward to negotiating the detail of that deal when the partners are ready with their proposals. This is a key part of our commitment to 100 percent coverage of deals across Scotland.\n\u0026ldquoWe want to see an ambitious deal that focuses on driving inclusive growth and the priorities that will make a difference and help the economy thrive. We want a deal that helps address the area\u0026rsquos connectivity challenges, supports growth in sectors particularly important in the Borderlands, and creates more opportunities for all to attract people to the area.\n\u0026ldquoWe are working to tackle the economic challenges in the South of Scotland, having already committed to establishing a South of Scotland enterprise agency, and we want to ensure that priorities align to maximise impact and success.\nSpeaking ahead of the conference the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell said:\n\"The Borderlands Growth Deal represents a unique opportunity to provide a real shot in the arm to the economy of our region, a region that faces similar challenges wherever you live or work within it.\n\u0026ldquoWorking with the proposals that have been prepared by local authorities, businesses and individuals, we will spend the summer shaping these in to a coherent deal that will support the economy of the region by encouraging people to invest in new opportunities, by building on our strengths and improving the lives of those who live here.\n\u0026ldquoIn that way, we will bring to the Borderlands the benefits that are now being seen across the UK as investment in City and Growth Deals progresses.\nDumfries and Galloway Council Chief Executive Gavin Stevenson said: \u0026ldquoCrucially we now sit between the emerging powerhouses of the central belt of Scotland and the Northern Powerhouse in England. Unless we act they will continue to suck up our young talent and skills.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to re-position ourselves, we need to stabilise and to stop our productivity falling and then we also need to reinvent. This feels like a once in a generation opportunity.\n\u0026ldquoWe know our potential, our children will not forgive us if there are no jobs in the future. I think we are at that point where we either put up or shut up. We get out there, we shout, we demand and we create the business opportunities.\nThose attending quizzed a panel, chaired by the UK Government\u0026rsquos Borderlands champion John Stevenson MP, on how the deal could support inclusivity, tourism projects and benefit small rural communities.\nFor more information visit the partnership website www.Borderlandsgrowth or email info@borderlandsgrowth\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Youngsters make a splash at Braw Lads  39  Swimming Gala","story":"SPECTATORS crammed into Galashiels Swimming Pool on Tuesday night for the Braw Lads\u0027 Swimming Gala.\nBraw Lad Greg Kelly, Braw Lass Kimberley O\u0027May and their attendants were given a rousing welcome as they came to support the young competitors.\nAnd the swimmers from all age groups put on a fantastic display throughout the evening, which culminated with the mixed aged group Braw Lads\u0027 Relay Race.\nThis event didn\u0027t disappoint.

Companies must stack their workforce with a minimum number of Saudi nationals or face heavy fines.\nTo encourage two-income households, Saudi women are taking on jobs that were once reserved for men.\nOn Sunday, when they start driving, many will no longer need to hire drivers. Women will even be allowed to work as drivers.\nUnder the crown prince, the message pushed by officials is that Saudi Arabia is modernising, not Westernising.\nThe prince has branded the reforms a return to \u0026ldquomoderate Islam.

The Depute Procurator Fiscal said he believed the practice of young men going at night to farms was becoming very common, farms when the men were absent being singled out for attention and the conduct of the accused on this occasion was, to say the least, pretty bad.A number of farmers had informed him that their one objection to joining the Volunteer Force was that if they left the house at night occurrences of this kind were sure to take place.Theft of rhododendron bloomsA girl residing in Campbeltown was charged with having, on May 28 in the grounds adjoining the public road from Carradale Post Office to the pier, and beside the entrance gate to Carradale Stables, stolen two rhododendron blooms.Accused admitted taking the blooms but said she did not know they were private property.She had gone to Carradale to inquire after a situation and was returning to the ferry when she spotted the flowers and climbed over a wall to get them.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"st columbas conventicle","story":"All religions have a mixture of good and bad points as do most political parties.When dealing with history, too, there are some literal truths, which both ministers at last Sunday\u0026#8217s Keil St Columba\u0026#8217s conventicle appeared to skip past.It was mentioned that the 6th century missionary based his teaching on a Bible written in Latin, but not that his name translated means \u0026#8216dove,\u0026#8217 a potent symbol of peace.In addition, at that time before the schism with Rome, St Columba, who also spoke Gaelic, offered the pagan hordes an education and health service rolled into one, with its roots in Europe.St Columba and his monks were the educated people of their time.While the medicine might well have been rudimentary, it was based on the learning of the Roman empire.

Would those closest to you think so?​Lots of questions this week.As we get to know each other better, our answer to the questions deepen.Jesus first asked his disciples who people said he was and they gave many answers.Then Jesus put them on the spot and said: \u0026#8216Who do you say that I am?\u0026#8217I can imagine the disciples looking puzzled and looking from one to the other for an answer.I imagine the silence would hang in the warm night air as Jesus waited for a response.And it was Peter who gave the answer that resonates through time when he said: \u0026#8216You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\u0026#8217Peter had recognised the wonder of this man before him and knew that he was of God.Jesus praised Peter for his intuition and no doubt the others knew they were in the presence of a sacred moment.Peter was not perfect and often his coat was on a shuggly peg, but in the end he served his Lord and went on to die for his faith.Who are you?\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7484923.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Festival guests left feeling cheesed off call for a refund","story":"              GUESTS at a cheese festival who were left disappointed by a lack of the smelly stuff on offer are calling for a refund.\u0026nbsp  The Big Cheese Festival, which was held at Hove Lawns yesterday, has been branded a \"shocking experience\" by\u0026nbspguests, with some saying they counted no more than two cheese stalls.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

Dean Conner, 33, of Links Avenue, has been handed an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) following an application by East Lothian Council.  The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees.

Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.

The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment.

S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes.

I thought \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom not having this\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos ridiculous.  \u0026ldquoIt was Keith\u0026rsquos birthday recently and we had a barbecue. They were sitting lined up in their cars looking to see what was going on.  \u0026ldquoI have sat outside with my breakfast some mornings and have had to lift my bowl of cereal and walk back in the house.  Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.  Another resident, who declined to be named agreed, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are getting no privacy and I can\u0026rsquot even sit out in the back garden for people looking in.  Alan Glasgow, Dunedin Canmore housing director, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware there are a small number of residents at Eskmills Road who have concerns about the garden fence.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to work with the community and local partners to see what can be done to help further increase privacy when people are using the nearby car park.  Dunedin Canmore stated that the pathway being used as a shortcut was the responsibility of East Lothian Council."},{"url":null,"title":"Giant mussel sculpture installed in Musselburgh","story":"              LOCAL photographer Angus Bathgate caught the installation of a giant mussel sculpture on camera as it was lowered onto Murdoch Green, Musselburgh.  The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.  The other is an archer planned for the banks of the River Esk, with its installation expected to be next week. A trail of arrows around the town is also planned and will link in with a Global Treasure App, a treasure trail organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959630.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Future of the Hollies Day Centre safeguarded","story":"              THE future of the Hollies Day Centre at its present location in Musselburgh has been safeguarded.  It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Phonebox removed from centre of Haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

A notice was posted inside the phonebox in January last year and, after no objections or attempts from members of the public to adopt the phonebox, it was removed.  A spokesman for BT said: \u0026ldquoBT is committed to providing a public payphone service, but with usage declining by over 90 per cent in the last decade, we\u0026rsquove continued to review and remove payphones which are no longer needed.  \u0026ldquoAny removal of payphones is carried out in strict adherence to the Ofcom guidelines.  \u0026ldquoOnly one call was made from this payphone in past 12 months.  \u0026ldquoNo objections were made about the removal of this payphone following the posting of a notice inside the kiosk in January 2017.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to maintain four payphones within 400 metres of the payphone on Court Street, Haddington.  \u0026ldquoAs an alternative to removal, we will continue to actively promote our Adopt a Kiosk scheme.

Colin Beattie\u0027s comments follows a \"positive meeting\" with health bosses in the wake of patients\u0027 concerns about the service at the enlarged practice in the Musselburgh Primary Care Centre.  The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7963089.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands march in London to demand referendum on Brexit deal","story":"              Tens of thousands marched through the streets of London to demand a referendum on the terms of Brexit on the second anniversary of the EU vote.  Demonstrators, waving EU flags and placards, attended the People\u0026rsquos Vote rally in central London on Saturday afternoon, walking from Pall Mall to Parliament Square.  Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, Green co-leader Caroline Lucas, actor Tony Robinson and pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller were among those who joined the crowd in the capital.  Sir Vince told the Press Association he thought evidence was pointing towards a public rethink of Brexit if the terms of any deal were put to a vote.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere are lots of things we didn\u0026rsquot know at the time.  \u0026ldquoWe didn\u0026rsquot know about the cost of the divorce bill, about the fact that we\u0026rsquod have less not more revenue for the NHS, we didn\u0026rsquot know about the Irish frontier problem.  \u0026ldquoWe didn\u0026rsquot know that we\u0026rsquore going to get president Trump or we\u0026rsquore going to destroy the trading system on which Brexit depends.

The move places Saudi women at the centre of a major transformation being spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  There is also a tug-of-war between those agitating for more openings for them and a religious majority that remains wary of changes that could be influenced by the West.  It was only a few years ago that religious police enforced an austere interpretation of Islam that banned music of any kind in public, much less the sound of a woman\u0026rsquos voice.  They could detain groups of unmarried men and women for simply standing or sitting together. They ensured restaurants and shops closed for daily prayers and waved sticks at women who had their hair or face uncovered.  Unlike previous Saudi monarchs who took cautious steps on reform, King Salman has granted his 32-year-old son and heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a free hand to usher in dramatic moves.  Allowing musical concerts, opening cinemas, easing restrictions on gender segregation and reigning in the powers of the religious police have all been signature reforms of the young prince.  He\u0026rsquos seen as the force behind the king\u0026rsquos decision to lift the ban on women driving.  On Friday outside a shopping centre in capital Riyadh, young single men and women walked through an open-air exhibit where Saudi women and traffic police explained the details of handling a car.  A song with a woman\u0026rsquos voice blared through the loudspeakers, singing: \u0026ldquoI love you Saudia. My love, Saudia.  Just four years ago, this government-sponsored event was unthinkable.  \u0026ldquoI can say that Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, came at the right time. He is young and motivated, said Lulwa al-Fireiji.  The 60-year-old quickly clarified that while there was \u0026ldquonothing wrong with previous Saudi rulers, now is the time for change.  \u0026ldquoI will get a license, but I won\u0026rsquot drive right away because the elders are always scared. But the young people are motivated and we need at this time someone like Mohammed bin Salman \u0026ndash motivated, God bless him, and daring. He will move the country (forward) faster, she said.  Granting women the right to drive is part of a wider blueprint for the future drawn up by the crown prince. The government is pushing Saudis to become less reliant on the government for jobs, handouts and subsidies.  Official statistics show women make up the overwhelming majority of job seekers in Saudi Arabia.  The state cannot create enough public sector jobs to keep up with the pace of Saudis seeking work, so foreigners are being booted out of jobs to make way. Companies must stack their workforce with a minimum number of Saudi nationals or face heavy fines.  To encourage two-income households, Saudi women are taking on jobs that were once reserved for men.  On Sunday, when they start driving, many will no longer need to hire drivers. Women will even be allowed to work as drivers.  Under the crown prince, the message pushed by officials is that Saudi Arabia is modernising, not Westernising.  The prince has branded the reforms a return to \u0026ldquomoderate Islam. Even the country\u0026rsquos ultra-conservative clerics, who for decades warned against allowing women to work and drive, have toed the line with muted statements of support."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7328008.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!

Sands, Aberdour  Beach front, Hawkcraig Road, Aberdour, Fife  Open every day 10am-5pm  01383 861473, www.facebook/Sands-A-Place-By-The-Sea-188201457968564  You can\u0026rsquot really get more seaside cafe than this, with a lovely outside seating area sat right on top of the Silver Sands beach. For a small place there is an extensive menu: with homemade chilli, burgers and pies as well as sandwiches and paninis. Happily, the staff are helpful and friendly and will accommodate any customers who need extra assistance.  6. Ebba\u0026rsquos Bistro, St Abbs  The Ebba Centre, Brierylaw, St Abbs, Berwickshire  Open every day 10am-4pm  01890771557, www.ebbacentre.weebly/ebbas-bistro.html  Housed within the community-trust owned Ebba Centre in the fishing village of St Abbs, this bistro boasts great views of the harbour and sea. The food doesn\u0026rsquot disappoint either, with excellent soups (the Cullen Skink in particular), burgers and even mussels. The cakes are tasty too.  7. The Caledonian Cafe, Skye  1 Wentworth St, Portree, Skye  Open every day 9am-4pm  01478 612553, www.caledoniancafe/  One of the more affordable eateries in Portree, the Caledonian Cafe offers a varied and appetising menu, with gluten free options available. The standout on the menu is the steak and kidney pie (flavoured with local ale) but they also do a delicious cooked breakfast that doesn\u0026rsquot scrimp on the portions. They are licensed too, so you can enjoy a cold pint alongside your hot lunch.  8. Buckley\u0026rsquos, Prestwick  59 Main St, Prestwick, Ayrshire  Open Monday-Saturday, 8.30pm-5.30pm and Sunday 10am-4pm  01292 737787, www.buckleysprestwick  One of the more gourmet cafes on this list, Buckley\u0026rsquos have modernised the traditional seaside cafe into something a bit more high-end. Their menu offers options such as chargrilled asparagus and avocado on toasted sourdough \u0026ndash alongside classic favourites like haddock and chips. They also have a full gluten-free menu to cater to those with intolerances and allergies, as well as take-away lunches and salad boxes.  9.

The food is freshly-prepared and locally sourced, and there are plenty of vegetarian and gluten-free options. And as an added bonus, if you bring your own coffee cup you get a 50p discount, in a bid to try and reduce plastic waste in the ocean.  10. Weavers Cafe, Tongue  Woodend, Rhitongue, Tongue, Sutherland  Open Tuesday-Saturday, 10am- 4pm, and Sunday- Monday 10.30am- 4pm  01847 611332, www.visitscotland  Weavers is set in a lovely spot overlooking the Kyle of Tongue, with outside seating on the deck to enjoy the sea air (as well as a cosy interior when it gets chilly). The soups and sandwiches are tasty, but Weavers is especially celebrated for their delicious homemade scones. But beware: you may struggle to restrain yourself to having just one. Or two. Or three\u0026hellip  11. Cafe Ca\u0026rsquoDora, Tarbert  Harbour St, Tarbert, Argyll and Bute  Open every day, 8am-9pm  01880 820258, https://www.facebook/cafecadora/  With great views of Tarbet\u0026rsquos postcard harbour, Ca\u0026rsquoDora has the atmosphere you would expect from a seaside cafe. Given they are so close to the sea it\u0026rsquos no surprise that there\u0026rsquos plenty of great seafood: the fresh prawns being a highlight. There is also pasta, pies and pizza, with a recently-added gluten free pizza option.  12. The Harbour Lights, Lossiemouth  5 Pitgaveny Quay, Lossiemouth, Moray  Open every day 8.30am-4pm  01343 814622, www.theharbour-lights/  If the weather is good in Lossiemouth, there are few nicer places to be than enjoying the harbour views from this cafe\u0026rsquos outdoor seats. A range of soups and sandwiches are available, or you can plump for a main meal (with the fish platter coming highly recommended). They aim to use local ingredients as much as possible, and have a handy list of suppliers at the bottom of the menu so you know exactly where your food is coming from.  13. Cool Gourmet, Stonehaven  23 High St, Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire  Open Monday-Saturday, 9.30am-4.30pm, and Sunday 10.30am-4.30pm  01569 767679, www.coolgourmet.wixsite/cool-gourmet  Dog owners look no further: your four-legged friend will get a warm welcome here with a bowl of water and dog biscuits provided as standard. Pets aside, the cakes are inventive and flavoursome (with the carrot cake a particular hit) and the homemade quiches and sandwiches are excellent. They are well-deserving of their Eatery of the Year prize in the Scottish Independent Retail Awards.  14. The Port Pantry, Portpatrick  24 Main Street, Portpatrick, Dumfries and Galloway  Open every day 9.30am-4.30pm  01776 810655, www.visitscotland  This cafe, on the harbour of Portpatrick, is loved by locals for its big cooked breakfasts. They also have an impressively large range of main meals to choose from, with the inventive Big Al\u0026rsquos Specials changing every weekend. Expect anything from beef tongue risotto to seafood linguini, and a lot else in between.  15. Delights, Stornoway  18 North Beach, Stornoway, Lewis  Open Monday- Saturday, 9am-6pm  01851 701472, www.facebook/Delights18/?rf=141972819195320  Offering some of the best-quality coffee on Lewis, Delights is popular with locals and visitors. There are lots of home-baked cakes (with dairy and gluten-free options), which can also be bought to take away from their deli shop.

Or, if you don\u0026rsquot fancy being generous, buy some treats for yourself and head along to the harbour to enjoy them while taking in the view."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7953768.jpg?type=article-full","title":"What s your favourite Scottish album ","story":"              The Herald is looking to find Scotland\u0027s favourite album. Here\u0027s our writers\u0027 choices - now we want to know yours.  Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989  Just seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. Over 25 years, it has offered me endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Heaven and Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990  There were few exotic sounds in early 1990s Glenrothes, but Liz Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack soaring from my bedroom from was one of them. This most accessible of the Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is awash with blissed-out grandeur, each exquisite track creating a world all of its own.  High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983  Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth, and reimagined them as the perfectly-crafted jangle-heavy creations he gave to the world. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  Marianne Taylor  Hope Is Important, Idlewild, 1998  Before they went all REM, Woomble and co produced this startling explosion of singalong hooks, soft-loud dynamics and crashing guitars with one song (A Film For The Future) that could sum up manic pop rock thrills for aliens.  Django Django, Django Django, 2012  Their insatiable rockabilly-tinged surf rock is a staple on my playlist and while the latest album has two of their best tunes, their Mercury-nominated debut was the real eyeopener.    Architect, C Duncan, 2015  The debut bedroom-produced, genre-hopping classical-meets-dream pop meets-space folk, featuring harmonies straight out of The Carpenters songbook, remains an ear-opening wonder that deserved to win the Mercury.  Martin Williams  City to City, Gerry Rafferty, 1978.  Not so much for the two big hits, Baker Street and Right Down the Line, but more for Whatever\u0026rsquos Written in Your Heart. Rafferty at his introspective best.  Listen to City to City  A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984  Tinseltown in the Rain, of course, from the band\u0026rsquos debut album. There\u0026rsquos Killermont Street by Aztec Camera but Tinseltown is the ode to Glasgow.  On Stolen Stationary, Michael Marra, 1991  Hermless. Marra at his witty best. The ultimate self-effacing anthem for our national football team. Such mischievous fun, too.  Barclay McBain  Treasure, The Cocteau Twins, 1984  I was a devout follower of John Peel\u0026rsquos radio show, a late-night portal to a different dimension and it was here I first heard the strange, ethereal, beguiling sounds of Liz Fraser and the Cocteau Twins, beamed through into my bedroom and my brain, like the best alien invasion ever. Not only was Liz from Earth, however, she was from Grangemouth, just down the road. After 30-odd years of listening, I still have absolutely no idea what she\u0026rsquos singing about, nor do I care. Just turn it up and let me dream.  Songs from Northern Britain, Teenage Fanclub, 1997  A long, long time ago, at a festival not too far from here, a man thrust a microphone in my face and asked me what Teenage Fanclub meant to me. In the second it took me to open my mouth to reply, they vanished. Collecting my thoughts from the comfort of a chemical toilet, I mused on the question. They are the band equivalent of your best friend, a constant. Always there, always dependable, the soundtrack to your greatest triumphs and most crushing defeats, they have your back, always ready with a smile and a hug. Cheers, pals.    The Three EPS, The Beta Band, 1998  Ok, so technically not an album, but three EPs gathered together for your listening pleasure. When John Cusack\u0026rsquos character in the film High Fidelity puts the Three Eps in his record shop, customers stop in their tracks. What\u0026rsquos this? they ask, \u0026ldquoit\u0026rsquos good! To which Cusack replies, smugly, I know. If only everyone did.  Lian Thomson  Sulk, The Associates, 1982  Of course, as any fool knows, 1982 is the annus mirabilis of Scottish pop (the fact that I was 19 that year may or may not be related). Above all else there was Sulk, the highpoint of new pop (alongside ABC\u0026rsquos Lexicon of Love), and Dundee\u0026rsquos finest gift to the culture. Alan Rankine and Billy McKenzie made pop music that was wilder, stranger and, yes, sexier, than everyone else that year. Party Fears Two is a song that is a song that teeters on the cusp of madness and is giddy at the very thought of it. It\u0026rsquos not even the best thing on the album.  Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I\u0026rsquove spilled, Kathryn Joseph, 2015  Because I believe every word she sings.  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  Presuming that Lloyd Cole\u0026rsquos Commotion-less albums don\u0026rsquot qualify (if they did, then Don\u0026rsquot Get Weird on Me would be a shoo-in), let\u0026rsquos go with the second album from Ayrshire\u0026rsquos finest exports. I\u0026rsquom not sure it\u0026rsquos better than their precocious debut Cake, but the bittersweet autumnal yearning of Earlies is the most gorgeous Scottish song no one has heard of.  Teddy Jamieson  This Is The Story, The Proclaimers, 1987  Its seminal track Letter From America was a soaring cry of solidarity for beleaguered working class communities across Scotland. The line \u0026ldquoBathgate no more \u0026ndash referring to the British Leyland plant which closed in 1984 \u0026ndash made this West Lothian youngster feel like someone was listening.  Listen to\u0026nbspLetter from America:\u0026nbsp  Popped In Souled Out, Wet Wet Wet, 1987  Ah, heady gems such as Wishing I Was Lucky, Angel Eyes and Sweet Little Mystery crooned by dreamboat Marti Pellow (err, what? I was nine). I played this album so often that the tape inside the cassette stretched and snapped. I saved up my pocket money and bought another.  The Hush, Texas, 1999  It was the soundtrack to my first newspaper job as a trainee reporter at the Basingstoke Gazette, the smoky-voiced tones of Sharleen Spiteri \u0026ndash singing Summer Son and In Our Lifetime \u0026ndash played through the tinny headphones of my Sony Discman.    Susan Swarbrick  All You Need Is\u0026hellip.Love and Money, Love and Money, 1986  Because it was the first album I ever owned (on cassette) because I loved James Grant\u0026rsquos voice and because it was a bit edgy and angry and I wasn\u0026rsquot either of those things, normally. It made me feel a bit dangerous.  Fruits of Passion, Fruits of Passion, 1987  A sadly-neglected pure pop classic \u0026ndash why oh why, did this wonderful band get left behind when the likes of Texas, Deacon Blue and Del Amitri soared? Pure, perfect vocals and singalong joy.  Listen to Kiss Me Now  Creeping up on Jesus, The Big Dish, 1988  I know it wasn\u0026rsquot as well received as their first album, Swimmer, but I always liked the happy, poppy feel of this one and it reminds me of driving around the north of Scotland in the summer sunshine with my love, when we were young and free as birds\u0026hellip  Ann Fotheringham  Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991  It was not their first album, but Bandwagonesque thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is this Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  The Beta Band, The Three Eps, 1998  Though technically a compilation, this laid out their manifesto more than any album from this cult Scots combo \u0026ndash a gloriously languid, ramshackle assembly of loose, off-kilter tunes, embroidered with hints of funk and electronica. They have never sounded better.  Music Has The Right To Children, Boards of Canada, 1998  The debut album of Scots electronic duo Boards of Canada is, for many, the high watermark for ambient electronic music. Two decades on from its release, its influence continues to be recognised and celebrated \u0026ndash and rightly so.  Scott Wright  Screamadelica, Primal Scream, 1991  It sounded in 1991 like it was made in the future and in 2018 it could have been recorded yesterday. Movin\u0026rsquo on Up really ought to be the national anthem. Stands out on its own.  Listen to Loaded  Grand Prix, Teenage Fanclub, 1995  Bellshill meets the US West Coast with predictably dreamy results. There is not a weak track on it and some of the lyrics would make a statue well up.  Psychocandy, The Jesus and Marychain, 1985  It wasn\u0026rsquot all madness and fighting in the Reid family. This album sees them flirt with the Beach Boys and, pun intended, they pull it off. Just Like Honey is perfection.  Neil Cameron  The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008  A decision to avoid albums detailing the painful end of a long-term relationship after the end of my own stopped me listening to Midnight Organ Fight for a few years, but diving back in was like meeting an old friend in the pub. It\u0026rsquos painful but cathartic. Like all of the late Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.  I Am An Island, Fatherson, 2014  My first experience of drinking alcohol was at a Fatherson gig in our hometown of Kilmarnock circa 2009, so their music has always been riddled with nostalgia for me. Their debut album is special because it taps into that difficult phase of growing up in, and moving out of, a small town that can sometimes feel desperate to pull you back.  The Bones of What You Believe, Chvrches, 2013  The juxtaposition of pop melodies and dark lyrics is the USP of this album, which can be appreciated on both a surface level and deeper, with every move having been intricately created by the three musicians. Lauren Mayberry brings a new a level of vulnerability to the genre which makes Chvrches stand out from the rest.  Holly Lennon  Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989  Heartache, the joy of human connection and a love letter to rainy Glasgow by night from a voice wrought with emotion. I\u0026rsquom forever grateful to my brother, Ewen, for the first hearing of the Downtown Lights, beyond his bedroom door.  Garbage, Garbage, 1995  Thrilling soundtrack to the giddy, alcohol-fuelled anticipation of student nights out, sung by the first cool ginger frontwoman I had ever seen.  These Streets, Paolo Nutini, 2006  The ache of leaving home and impermanence of first love refreshingly articulated in Nutini\u0026rsquos Paisley brogue with a maturity beyond his years.    Caroline Wilson  Solid Air, John Martyn, 1973  Superb guitar playing, great songs and Martyn\u0026rsquos trademark slurred jazzy vocals make this a fascinating album, like nothing we\u0026rsquod ever heard before. Martyn had star quality and talent in abundance but he also had a self-destructive streak and simply did what he liked, on and off stage, and never made the \u0026ldquobig time. He made other great albums, notably One World, but this is him at his peak.  Listen to Solid Air  White Album, Average White Band, 1974  Great songs, astonishing double lead vocal from Alan Gorrie and Hamish Stuart, fabulous funky drumming from Robbie McIntosh and the Dundee Horns of Ball on Pick Up The Pieces, this topped both the UK and US charts. Black American artists couldn\u0026rsquot believe the band were white, never mind Scottish, when they heard it. Still a classic 44 years on.  Sunshine on Leith, The Proclaimers, 1988  A clutch of superb self-written songs, the Reid twins singing in their own accents (very unusual back then), a great session band and Pete Wingfield\u0026rsquos sensitive production turned this into a classic. Hell, they even made a musical and film based on it. Thirty years on and we\u0026rsquore still singing along with the choruses.  Frank Morgan  Exploited, Troops of Tomorrow, 1982  \u0026ldquoSomething\u0026rsquos happened/what\u0026rsquos gone wrong/Going down the dole/got to sign on/Millions of kids with nowt to do/You better watch out they\u0026rsquore after you. It\u0026rsquos 1982, the country is falling apart and Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Wattie Buchan and Big John Duncan have the perfect response. Fast, angry, hardcore punk.  Twilight Sad, Forget the Night Ahead, 2009  An uncompromising post-rock wall of sound, with uncompromising Scottish accents. Like nothing I\u0026rsquod heard before. What The Proclaimers would sound like if they were a Chem19 band channelling Nine Inch Nails.  Test Dept, Brith Gof, Gododdin, 1989  Pipes and drums and tribal soul \u0026ndash this was the sound of Europe\u0026rsquos ancient minorities refusing to fade away. Angus Farquhar\u0026rsquos finest musical moment before coming a full-time arts revolutionary with NVA.  Garry Scott  I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, Trashcan Sinatras, 1993  From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  Avocet, Bert Jansch, 1979  One for the diaspora. Released as punk morphed into post-punk and new wave, the Edinburgh-born guitarist\u0026rsquos 12th studio album came from another world entirely. Around the theme of wading birds he weaves a fabric of folk, jazz and improvised playing that never loses its capacity to enthral.  Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I\u0026rsquove Spilled, Kathryn Joseph, 2015  Irrefutable evidence that the best music doesn\u0026rsquot belong to the distant past, Glasgow-based Aberdonian Kathryn Joseph\u0026rsquos hard-won success with her debut was fuelled in equal measure by her powerfully emotional music, glorious enthusiasm and unwillingness to mask the fact that when you reach 40 there\u0026rsquos some baggage you either can\u0026rsquot or don\u0026rsquot want to leave behind, so best use it to stoke the fire of creativity.

Earlier this week, the Nationalist leader in the Commons intensified the political rhetoric when he denounced the Scottish Secretary as \u0026ldquoyellow for not speaking in a debate and a \u0026ldquodismal failure in his role at the Scotland Office.  He accused Mr Mundell of \u0026ldquostabbing Scotland in the back over the devolved powers controversy, declaring: \u0026ldquoHe fails to stand up for Scotland as a country, fails to stand up for our Parliament, he sees us as subservient. That\u0027s why the Secretary of State needs to go. He is quite simply unfit for the office he holds.\"  Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos remarks came just days after he was ordered from the Commons by the Speaker and led a mass walkout of SNP MPs from the chamber.  Following the dramatic event, Mr Salmond, who himself walked out of the Commons during Chancellor Nigel Lawson\u0026rsquos 1988 Budget statement, suggested he had been the SNP\u0026rsquos inspiration by telling the party leader that targeting interventions on key occasions was the way to make a successful protest.  \"Certainly, that was my advice to Ian Blackford when he phoned me last Tuesday night and I was delighted to see him carry it through,\" explained the former First Minister.  But when the Highland MP was asked if Mr Salmond was pulling the party leadership\u0026rsquos strings at Westminster, he responded with a firm \u0026ldquoNo.  Mr Blackford also insisted his angry remarks directed at Mundell were not meant to be personal.  \u0026ldquoI was robust in how I spoke because the Secretary of State has failed to defend Scotland at every turn, he has been a complete failure, he declared.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot wish to be personal about the Secretary of State but on the lack of ability in serving Scotland\u0026rsquos interest, as defined by the Government itself, it is not good enough.  The party leader made clear he had not accused individual MPs of being \u0026ldquoanti-Scottish but, rather, Theresa May\u0026rsquos Government.  A Whitehall insider suggested the SNP leadership was losing the argument on the Brexit Bill, which was why it was resorting to \u0026ldquocheap personal attacks.  Meanwhile, as Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, and Michael Russell, her Brexit Minister, headed for Guernsey to attend the British-Irish Council, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office Minister, who will also be at the meeting, stressed how, despite the strong disagreements with Edinburgh over the Brexit Bill, the UK Government was committed to improving the depth of its co-operation with the SNP administration.  \u0026ldquoWhatever the inevitable political noise as we unpick the complexities of our membership of the EU, I will ensure that we maintain the depth of our ongoing engagement with the Scottish Government, including this week at the British-Irish Council in Guernsey. I hope that the Scottish Government will maintain their own side of that relationship.  He added: \u0026ldquoBy working together, we will help secure a deal that sees us leave the European Union as a more modern country where all four nations have their voices heard but also as one United Kingdom as the people of Scotland voted for in 2014."},{"url":null,"title":"Younger generation has little chance of becoming wealthy  report claims","story":"              Young people today have less chance of becoming truly wealthy than any previous post-war generations, according to a new report.  Whether or not they inherit sizeable assets from parents or other relatives will be the most important factor determining their eventual wealth, rather than ability or effort, analysts from the Resolution Foundation claim.  The report says big falls in home ownership rates since are a key factor in the wealth gap for young adults. Home ownership rates fell from 48 per cent in 2003 to 32 per cent today.  Typical Scottish wealth now totals \u0026pound237,000 per household, and the total household wealth in Scotland has now exceeded \u0026pound1 trillion for the first time, the report says.  Overall wealth in Scotland has grown from five times GDP to seven times GDP over the last decade, much faster than incomes which makes it harder to close wealth gaps by earning and saving.  Even a high income family, in the top ten per cent of households with a \u0026pound58,000 income would have to save every penny they earn for 19 years to become \"truly wealthy\" \u0026ndash with assets of over \u0026pound1 million\u0026ndash the report says.  But the reality is 25 per cent of Scots have savings of less than \u0026pound500, and seven per cent have savings of zero, or have current accounts in the red.  The Foundation is calling for politicians to take more account of wealth in policy-making and debates, and said that while reforms of council tax were welcome, it is one of the most significant wealth taxes. As it is devolved, the Scottish Government could do more to make it more accurately reflect property values, the report says.  Torsten Bell, Director of the Resolution foundation, said: \"Wealth in Scotland has grown fast in recent years and will come to play a bigger role in determining life chances in the decades to come.  \"This increase in wealth across Scotland has sat alongside falling home ownership rates, particularly for young families, who are struggling to accumulate wealth as preceding generations have been able to.\"  As a result the \u0027millennial\u0027 generation could be the first since the second world war to earn less than their parents over their lifetime.  \"The accumulation, distribution and taxation of wealth should be at the centre of policy debates in Scotland in the years ahead,\" Mr Bell added. \"If current trends continue it will become much harder in modern Scotland to earn your way to being truly wealth, and young people\u0027s prospects will depend lesson their ability and more on whether or not they inherit assets from relatives.\"  Neil Brennan, director of Fitzallan Ltd, Glasgow-based Chartered Financial Planners\u0026rsquo, said: \"Compared to previous generations, younger people typically stay at home longer, join the job market later and have very high expectations as to standard of living.\"  Many use disposable income for cars, holidays, leisure activities and fashion their parents might have done without, he said. \"Younger generations find it difficult to bridge the \u0026lsquowealth gap\u0026rsquo as they have low savings/high spending habits and do not get onto the housing market as early as their parents.\"  Pension auto-enrolment will help, but young people are starting work later and still do not begin saving for retirement as early as their parents did, he added.  \"As a financial adviser, we would encourage young people to save or investor contribute to pensions, even at modest levels, to get the \u0026lsquopot boiling\u0026rsquo.  \"Many younger people will have to rely on inheritances, even modest ones, to allow them to pay off their mortgages or retire before they are very old.\""},{"url":null,"title":"SNP  39 s Mike Russell    39 We don  39 t trust the UK Government  39  with Brexit preparation","story":"              Holyrood will not give consent to any further Brexit legislation until the \"broken\" devolution system is fixed, Scotland\u0027s Brexit Minister has indicated.

He added that he \"couldn\u0027t conceive of circumstances\" where MSPs would vote to give approval for further legislation related to leaving the EU, such as trade, agriculture and fisheries.  MPs approved parts of the EU Withdrawal Bill related to devolution after less than 20 minutes of debate last week, despite the Scottish Parliament voting against granting formal consent for the Bill.  Under the Sewel Convention, Westminster does not normally legislate on devolved matters without Holyrood\u0027s approval.  First Minister Nicola Surgeon said the convention had been \"ripped up\", while Mr Russell told MSPs earlier this week that \"urgent discussions\" must now take place with Westminster over the issue.  Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland\u0027s Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Russell said: \"We are absolutely clear that the way that devolution operates and the structures of devolution have failed, and they failed because the UK Government is refusing to operate them.  \"For example, on the Sewel Convention, we need to have the interpretation of that written down in statute and made legally binding, because what we\u0027ve presently got is a situation where the UK Government makes the rules and then breaks them themselves, and there are no sanctions.\"  He said that, while there was \"practical work\" to do to prepare for Brexit, \"it is very difficult to do that work because, frankly, we don\u0027t trust the UK Government with it\".  Mr Russell added that he \"couldn\u0027t conceive of circumstances in which we brought legislative consent motions about Brexit issues to the chamber until we have resolved the issue of the Sewel Convention and the way the parliaments work together. We don\u0027t trust that system any longer.  \"The ball is very much in their (the UK Government\u0027s) court we have said there are things we cannot now do because they have broken the system.  \"They need to look at that and they need to work constructively with us.\""},{"url":null,"title":"House of Fraser to close stores and slash 6 000 jobs","story":"              HOUSE of Fraser has been given the green light from creditors to axe more than half of its store estate, resulting in up to 6,000 job losses.  The struggling department store chain will close 31 out of its 59 outlets through a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), which will also allow it to secure rent reductions on its remaining shops.  Closures will affect up to 2,000 House of Fraser staff and a further 4,000 across brands and concessions.  House of Fraser secured the backing of more than 75% of creditors, including landlords, for the CVA at a meeting on Friday.  It was voted through despite anger among landlords, who have complained that they are being forced to stomach a financial hit at the same time as House of Fraser enjoys new investment.  Alongside the CVA, Hamleys owner C.banner is being lined up to buy a 51% stake in the firm and invest \u0026pound70 million into what remains of the business.  At the meeting, furious landlords berated House of Fraser\u0027s management and their advisers at KPMG over how the CVA was conducted.  They complained that their share of the vote had been structured unfairly in an attempt to push through the restructuring proposal.  Despite their protestations, a representative for two of House of Fraser\u0027s landlords said there had been \"no give\" from the top team.  House of Fraser boss Alex Williamson had warned that the store closures and job losses represented the \"last viable\" option to save the retailer, with the group at risk of collapse had the CVA been rejected.  Mr Williamson and chairman Frank Slevin were both in attendance at the creditor vote.  House of Fraser said the shops earmarked for closure, including its Oxford Street store, would remain open until early 2019.  The group also plans to relocate its Baker Street head office and the Granite House office in Glasgow to help slash costs and \"secure House of Fraser\u0027s future\".  A raft of CVAs have been struck in recent months as retailers struggle amid surging costs, rising business rates, competition from online rivals and a slowdown in consumer spending.  Other retailers undertaking CVAs in a bid to keep trading include New Look, Mothercare and Carpetright.  Restaurant businesses have also been seeking to cut their costs with store closure programmes, with Carluccio\u0027s, Byron and Prezzo all pushing through CVAs this year."},{"url":null,"title":"The day in pictures   15 photographs that made today s news","story":"                        The day in pictures:Sebastian Samy tries out at giant deck chair  ahead of the RHS Garden Harlow Car\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtr Flower Show in Har\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtrogate, Yorkshire which opens on Friday June 22nd until Sunday June 24th.

The Football Supporters\u0027 Federation (FSF) said \"disproportionate hype\" about the spectres of hooliganism and political tensions with Russia had stopped many from travelling.  Relations between the UK and Russian governments were plunged into a deep freeze following the poisoning in March of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal, while MPs raised concerns of a repeat of the violent attack in Marseille during Euro 2016.  England fans reported feeling outnumbered in Volgograd ahead of the 2-1 win against Tunisia on Monday, while there were around 4,000 empty seats in the stadium.  The group, which worked closely with the FA and the Foreign Office to prepare travel advice for fans, also cited the long distances, high costs and unlikely holiday feel to many host cities as factors for low numbers.  Many England fans have spent thousands travelling to watch the Three Lions, taking multiple indirect planes or train journeys that last up to 24 hours.  In a blog post, the FSF said there was a \"great\" disparity between the image portrayed in the media and the welcome fans had received in Volgograd.  \"The only sad thing about the whole experience is that the numbers of England fans who have been here to enjoy it have been so low: we reckon it\u0027s been probably the lowest number of England fans at a World Cup game for 30 years,\" the FSF said.  \"We know there are a lot of other reasons why a lot of people have chosen to support the team from back home - there\u0027s the distances, the cost of travel, the inescapable fact that Russia isn\u0027t really a traditional family holiday destination - but it\u0027s nonetheless a shame that some fans have been deterred from coming here because of disproportionate hype about the hooligan threat or political tensions.  \"The big majority of Russian people have been immensely friendly, generous and welcoming.  \"England fans above all should know from bitter experience the price that can be paid for judging everybody on the behaviour of a minority.\"  The FSF added that reports of hiked food and accommodation prices and an overbearing police and security presence had been \"unfounded\", with security forces \"visible but unobtrusive\".  And fans\u0027 presence in Nizhny Novgorod was reportedly low two days before the Three Lions play Panama on Sunday."},{"url":null,"title":"Scotland to bask in temperatures higher than Marbella","story":"              Scotland is ready to bask in a summer heatwave next week with temperatures due to rise higher than Spanish sunspot Marbella.

In 2000, the SNP suspended Mr Blackford as its treasurer after he queried the party\u0026rsquos spending under El Presidente\u0026rsquos regime. Mr Blackford accused him of \u0026ldquocontrol freakery, treating folk with \u0026ldquoutter contempt, and \u0026ldquopolitical cowardice. Terms of affection he now reserves for the Tories.  MIND you, there was something distinctly Eck-esque in the way Mr Blackford cuffed away Moray MP Douglas Ross in Monday\u0026rsquos debate on the Sewel Convention. The youthful Tory, who is a part-time referee, asked about Holyrood having more powers after Brexit. Mr Blackford was unimpressed. \u0026ldquoTo use a football term, that was miles offside, son, he sniffed.  MR Blackford also gave an unlikely plug mid-peroration. \u0026ldquoThere is a wonderful book called \u0026lsquoThe Scottish Secretaries\u0026rsquo, he told MPs. This was most unusual as the author is none other than Nat b\u0026ecircte noire David Torrance, recently lampooned in an SNP political broadcast. Mr Torrance tweeted he was \u0026ldquotouched by the mention. \u0026ldquoMust be the first time a Nationalist used the term \u0026lsquowonderful\u0026rsquo in relation to something you wrote, observed Tory MSP Murdo Fraser accurately.  MR Salmond cropped up in Wednesday\u0026rsquos Holyrood debate on freedom of information. The former FM was notoriously irked by FoI. LibDem Willie Rennie recalled it once took seven months for the government to admit taxpayers paid \u0026pound259 for a pair of Eck\u0026rsquos tartan trews for a trip to China. Labour\u0026rsquos Neil Findlay was more interested in serious affairs. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot really care much about Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos sartorial inelegance, he sneered magnificently.  TALKING of FoI, a Holyrood committee recently invited campaigners to discuss the subject. True to form, dopey officials suggested the meeting take place in private and be un-minuted. They were soon put straight on transparency matters. Meanwhile, at another FoI meeting this week, Mr Findlay was dramatically called out of the room. Red-faced, he later admitted - full disclosure - that he\u0027d accidentally pushed the panic button under his desk.  ANECDOTES galore at the PinkNews summer reception at Holyrood, starting with Green MSP Patrick Harvie, who recounted the dark early days of devolution. He recalled the Daily Mail had once branded him a \u0026ldquogay activist turned MSP who outrageously \u0026ldquodescribed himself as bisexual, enjoying relationship with both men and women. Mr Harvie sighed. \u0026ldquoIf they\u0026rsquod written \u0026lsquohoping for\u0026rsquo it would at least have been accurate.  LIBDEM Alex Cole-Hamilton, of Holyrood\u0026rsquos equality committee, was up next. He said he was still new to the parliament, so the Daily Mail had yet to form a view of him. \u0026ldquoThe only thing they\u0026rsquove written about me was to say I looked like a solicitor and sound like a minor member of the Royal Family.

Scottish Canals said a major cash shortage meant maintaining navigation across its routes was \u0026ldquounsustainable, with barges facing being banished from key sections such as around the world-famous Falkirk Wheel.  But critics have blasted the plans, insisting it would leave parts of the ancient network no more than \u0026ldquostagnant ditches.  They accused those in charge of squandering a \u0026pound79 million fund to modernise the waterways at the turn of the millennium.  Labour\u0026rsquos shadow Scotland minister Paul Sweeney branded the proposals \u0026ldquoan absolute scandal, and called on SNP transport minister Humza Yousaf to intervene and guarantee that navigation on the canals will be maintained.  A Transport Scotland spokesman said it was in regular contact with canal bosses \u0026ldquoto discuss the opportunities and the challenges around maintaining these historic assets.  He said: \u0026ldquoScottish Canals have been allocated \u0026pound11.6m in the budget for 2018/19 with an increase of \u0026pound0.5m \u0026ndash 16 per cent \u0026ndash in the capital allocation to \u0026pound3.5m.  \u0026ldquoWe recognise the challenges faced by Scottish Canals and will continue to work in partnership to support the organisation in their operations and to explore potential sources of funding.  In comes after Scottish Canals revealed the future for parts of its 137-mile network \u0026ldquomay not necessarily include navigation.  In a strategy document, it said the two main canals will be the Caledonian and Crinan, which between them see some 85,000 boat movements a year. In comparison, the Forth and Clyde Canal between Glasgow and Bowling sees just 200.  Campaigners have condemned Scottish Canals\u0026rsquo handling of the network, insisting the lack of investment threatens jobs and tourism. Former canals boss Steven Dunlop has just taken over as the \u0026pound168,000-a-year boss of Scottish Enterprise.  Scottish Tory MSP Alison Harris said plans to shut sections of the network were a \u0026ldquocompletely unacceptable state of affairs.  She said: \u0026ldquoScottish Canals has failed to invest in maintaining its core product \u0026ndash the canal itself \u0026ndash and now we\u0026rsquore seeing the cost of that.  \u0026ldquoThis means even more revenue will be lost from tourism, there\u0026rsquos a risk the water quality will worsen through lack of use, and that businesses who rely on the canal will either close or relocate.  Catherine Topley, Scottish Canals\u0026rsquo interim CEO, said it simply did not have enough resources, meaning \u0026ldquohard decisions were inevitable."},{"url":null,"title":"Kevin McKenna  Proper scrutiny vital if Glasgow School of Art is to be rebuilt","story":"              ONE of the tiresome consequences of Scotland\u0026rsquos recent constitutional turbulence has been the steady expansion of a class of political chatteratti. Many take turns at sitting on the boards of worthy public bodies in the hope that they might get to touch the hems of politicians and thus make them seem interesting at each other\u0026rsquos dinner parties. They fluff around these elected members and write blogs about \u0026ldquoThe Constitution or \u0026ldquoBrexit or \u0026ldquoThe Democratic Deficit that are equalled in their pomposity by their tediousness.  They\u0026rsquore a harmless enough assortment of chiels and many put the large quantum of spare time they have to some use by playing musical chairs on Scotland\u0026rsquos swollen quangocracy. Where it begins to get a little more sinister is when this self-regarding political class guards each other\u0026rsquos backs on matters requiring public accountability, usually involving large sums of our money or nepotism.  Many have had a ball this week indulging in a bacchanal of grief over the fire that consumed the Glasgow School of Art\u0026rsquos beautiful Mackintosh building. This is not to suggest that the fire that raged last Friday night and Saturday morning did not merit widespread dismay. The Mackintosh is one of only a handful of buildings which have come partly to define the cities they adorn. In time Dundee\u0026rsquos new V\u0026ampA will also surely come to find a place in that city\u0026rsquos heart.  The Mackintosh seeped into Glasgow\u0026rsquos soul because it possessed something of what we like to think we\u0026rsquore about: unconventional, idiosyncratic and blessed with a subtle wit. That Charles Rennie Mackintosh insisted on designing a living, breathing place of work for generations of our most creative talents \u0026ndash and not something inert and aloof \u0026ndash enchanted us further.  Our sadness was intensified by the knowledge that the fire occurred at the end of a \u0026pound35 million restoration process following the first fire in 2014. Then, as now, there was deep sorrow at the damage caused to the Mackintosh and this seemed to sweep aside niggling questions about the management of such a fragile and elegant building.  Thus, we were never adequately told why there was no working sprinkler system on site at the time. The response that \u0026ldquoa new one was in the midst of being fitted just doesn\u0026rsquot cut it. Nor was it explained why artistic installations requiring the use of highly flammable materials were being encouraged in such a building.  In a coruscating article for the Scottish Review last week Eileen Reid, the former Head of Widening Participation at Glasgow School of Art, cut through all the hand-wringing and lamentation. \u0026ldquoIn truth, the seeds of the Mack\u0026rsquos destruction were sown long before both fires, she wrote. \u0026ldquoMembers of staff and alumni who raised issues about the safety of the building for years prior to 2014 had to remain tight-lipped after the first fire, or condemned as churlish in the wave of sympathy and grief. Fire experts are shaking their heads in disbelief. Where, they ask, was the full modern preventative technology that exists for life safety and property protection?  Like many others, Ms Reid is seeking answers to some basic questions about the responsibilities of GSA\u0026rsquos Board of Trustees. The board, by deployment of its PR machine and the pledges of support from international luminaries, managed to escape close scrutiny following the first fire. It\u0026rsquos deeply concerning that some of the same questions arising from the first conflagration remain present in the second one. There is a case for the resignation of the board of directors while the investigation takes place.  Others may feel that it is only after such an investigation that roles should be examined. It was surely unwise to distance themselves from any degree of responsibility following the second fire, just as they had done after the first one.  It\u0026rsquos also crucial to our expectations of openness and accountability \u0026ndash especially where so much public money is involved \u0026ndash that there should be a public inquiry into the causes of both fires and the stewardship of the building. By its very nature Glasgow is an optimistic and cheery city and by the end of this week there is hope that the fa\u0026ccedilade at least might be saved for any rebuilding of the Mackintosh building.  Early cost estimates of the work involved in this seem to have gathered around a figure of \u0026pound200m. If that\u0026rsquos an early estimate the actual cost will probably be much greater. Those who have been weeping and gnashing their teeth over cocktails and glasses of Sauvignon Blanc have been remarkably breezy about the cost. They always are when it\u0026rsquos other people\u0026rsquos money. \u0026ldquoWell, of course we must re-build the Mack darlings, no matter the cost: it\u0026rsquos soooo iconic.  Less than a mile to the east of Glasgow city centre are to be found some of the most disadvantaged and deprived neighbourhoods in western Europe. Places where the struggle to survive is fought on a day-to-day basis have become iconic for different reasons. The inequality in this city is such that many can only press their faces up against the glass walls that separate them from the complacent elites and their high-minded pretences and caprices.  They are not so insular as to resist slices of capital expenditure by estimating how many hospitals and nurses they might otherwise fund. They might never have visited the Mackintosh in its former glory and may never set foot in any attempted facsimile of it. Credit them, though, with a knowledge of ageless beauty and of those things that genuinely enhance our city\u0026rsquos reputation. They don\u0026rsquot need to be lectured on how much Mackintosh\u0026rsquos great masterpiece means to Glasgow.  They also know the value of money much more than those of us who exist in our cosseted, indolent, political bubbles. If this city of extremes is to be granted leave to spend several hundred million reconstructing the Mack, they\u0026rsquoll want to know that the responsibility for such a massive outlay resides in people who can be trusted and who do not care about OBEs and swanning about the west end."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7965431.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Game of Thrones couple marry in real life in Scotland","story":"              GAME of Thrones stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie are\u0026nbsptying the knot in\u0026nbspScotland today.

Now, however, the cost of electricity to power festive lighting will continue to be covered by the local authority after a new approach was agreed by councillors.                                                    Members of the Infrastructure Services Committee (ISC) gave the go ahead to a new policy aimed at ensuring a reasonable, consistent and safe approach to requests from community groups.        Hanging baskets, banners and bunting are also covered by the new rules, as well as attachments to street lighting columns, such as signs.Councillors heard the use of festive lighting, bunting, banners and hanging baskets can help encourage commercial activity in towns, add seasonal colour and help promote community events.ISC previously considered proposals which would have seen community groups covering electricity costs for festive lights, hearing there was strong opposition to this from local councillors and groups.Members asked officers to revisit the plans, setting up a working group to further investigate the potential impacts of the proposals.                                                                                                        An engagement meeting was held with groups in April where a number of concerns were raised and consideration of these led to changes to the proposed policy. Electricity supplied through the public street lighting network will not be charged for and the council will now perform technical assessments on the suitability of lighting columns and advise community groups after it had been initially proposed that applicants would have to perform these safety tests themselves.Applications for festive lighting installations can now be submitted by October 1.There will be restrictions on installations outwith main footfall areas, but an arrangement to allow the use of festive lights featuring the branding of commercial organisations will be extended by a year.ISC chair, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “The cost of electricity for festive lighting in Aberdeenshire is around £11,000 and that seems a small price to pay for the goodwill of communities making the effort to brighten themselves up and appear welcoming at Christmas – we recognise a lot of organisation and effort goes into this already. The excellent work communities do is clearly of benefit to the whole of Aberdeenshire and the cost is one we can bear.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"pupils enjoy kidsout event","story":"\t\tLocal youngsters enjoyed a fun day participating in a wide range of activities when they attended a Rotary KidsOut Aberdeen event held a SRUC Craibstone Campus recently.\t\t\t\tTwelve pupils and eight teachers from Ellon Primary School, along with two Ellon Rotarian helpers attended.

By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances. All the ports were very competitive and attractive.Saturday 23 Jun 2018 8:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04115000/04115648.jpg","title":"Marcs Croatia role gives Caithness a World Cup connection","story":"Marc Rochon is currently in Kaliningrad working with the Croatia team as a video analyst ahead of the Group D game against Nigeria and subsequent matches against Argentina and Iceland.Marc, who is from John O\u0026rsquoGroats, landed the role after previously working with Croatia boss Zlatko Dalic for the Al Ain team in the United Arab Emirates.The role involves analysing the Croat players\u0026rsquo strengths and weaknesses and helps Dalic to work on improving his team\u0026rsquos performance levels.Also, Marc helps to prepare dossiers on any opposing sides that Croatia face, looking to spot any potential weaknesses.Marc\u0026rsquos career in video analysis took off when he met with the analysis team at English club Southampton while studying sports science at Solent University.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNow he is involved in football\u0026rsquos biggest tournament and could hold the key in helping Croatia \u0026ndash whose best display came when they finished third in 1998 \u0026ndash achieve world glory.He said: \u0026ldquoI have been working with the head coach Zlatko Dalic for three and a half years in Al Ain.

All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

Feedback gathered will help us as we review route and timetable specifications for the 2020-2025 contract.”Both the ‘Bus Users’ and ‘Non-Bus Users’ surveys are available from the ‘Consultation and Engagement’ section of the council website. The direct link is available here.Paper copies are available on request from the Council’s Transportation Team for those unable to access the online surveys, by emailing transport@orkney.gov.uk or calling tel 01856 873535 ext 2539.

Orkney topped the table in Scotland and was placed tenth in the UK as a whole.While is the responsibility of businesses to make sure they are meeting hygiene standards, local authorities play an important role in ensuring food safety compliance, with enforcement overseen by the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland.Chairman of Orkney Islands Council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, Councillor Graham Sinclair, said the results demonstrate constructive working between the Council’s Environmental Health team and the local business community:“We’re delighted yet again to see Orkney feature at the top of this survey.“This consistency speak volumes not only about the quality of the advice and guidance the council team provides, but also the commitment of local businesses to their food safety responsibilities and on providing safe premises and products for their customers.“It reflects very well on Orkney and on the quality eating and dining out experience for locals and visitors alike.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
