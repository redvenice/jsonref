If you step into the role of financial adviser you are personally at risk.\u0027Please only look at yourself. I have sent the info around - that is the limit of what I am allowed to do.\u0027         Jordi Casamitjana (front right) leaves an Employment Tribunal in Norwich after it ruled that ethical veganism is a philosophical belief and is therefore protected by law, in January In his witness statement, Mr Casamitjana said: \u0027I was treated unlawfully because of my ethical veganism and my protected disclosures.In his witness statement during January\u0027s landmark win, Mr Casamitjana claimed that he goes as far as avoiding holding onto leather straps or sitting on leather seats, and prefers to walk rather than catch a bus in case the vehicle kills a fly while on its journey. \u0027I did not think of myself as a whistleblower when I made my protected disclosures - rather I was motivated by my ethical veganism,\u0027 he said in his newer statement, today. \u0027As a result of those disclosures, I was disciplined, and the decisions both to uphold the disciplinary and to dismiss me were made because I am an ethical vegan.\u0027When the pension information was sent to me and I checked the type of pension fund it was, I realised that this was not an ethical fund and some of its investments went to companies which hurt animals and damage the environment.\u0027He claimed that despite being told his pension contributions would be stopped until an alternative was found, he checked with pension provider Aegon and found LACS had paid over £1,750 into it on his behalf.Mr Casamitjana said: \u0027I was shocked by this.         Mr Casamitjana was sacked from his position as head of policy and research at the League Against Cruel Sports  in April 2018.

It was grossly against my core beliefs.\u0027I had originally felt the problem of investing into an unethical fund probably started out as an administrative accident likely caused when management didn\u0027t closely scrutinise the pensions arrangements when auto-enrolment was set up.\u0027After the meeting with Andy Knott on January 18, however, my impression was that he knew that staff were being misled but he wasn\u0027t concerned about this.\u0027I had understood his instruction of not sending anything to all staff referring only to the PDF. I assumed that through our conversations I had persuaded him to send it.\u0027When I saw that he had sent it, I understood his instruction to have been superseded: that he had told me not to send something that had now been sent by him. \u0027As I believed Andy\u0027s email instruction only referred to the PDF, and as the information provided by Andy was incomplete and potentially misleading, I subsequently sent an email to all staff letting them know about the fact that their pension fund may still be the \u0027unethical\u0027 one, telling them about the existence of all the other ethical funds, telling them that I was planning to changed mine - but not specifying to which. This is the email that I was dismissed for.\u0027In the email, he wrote: \u0027If it is of any help to everyone else that is a bit confused and don\u0027t want their fund to be unethical, this is what I have personally done so far to change my fund.         \u0027I did not think of myself as a whistleblower when I made my protected disclosures - rather I was motivated by my ethical veganism,\u0027 Mr Casamitjana, pictured today, said in the tribunal \u0027Please don\u0027t interpret this email as a financial advice as I am not a financial adviser, or as advice from the League or the League\u0027s management as nobody has instructed me to send this or to do what I have done. This is just me telling you what I have done, in the hope that will help you.\u0027Following the email, the charity began investigating what it called \u0027Failure to follow reasonable management instructions\u0027 and \u0027Serious insubordination.\u0027After dropping the latter allegation, Mr Casamitjana was put before a disciplinary panel and eventually dismissed.In a letter delivering the outcome of his disciplinary hearing, head of HR Jo Lister wrote \u0027I consider the email you sent to staff biased because of your ethical principles and could influence them to change their pension arrangement.\u0027Whilst I appreciate that some staff might find the information you sent useful, it is not your duty or responsibility to advise them and the League does not seek to impose any specific ethical principles on staff.\u0027The hearing, at Watford Employment Tribunals, continues. "},{"url":null,"title":"Rio celebrates day two world famous carnival","story":"Share this article          Many of the perfomers, such is this woman with the Unidos da Jijuca samba school wear elaborate costumes          Up to 500,000 people a year take to the streets in Rio de Janeiro for the city\u0027s carnival celebration which marks the beginning of the austere Lenten season          Most towns and cities in Brazil host similar festivals but Rio\u0027s are renowned across the globe as the most elaborate          The carnival schools make their way to the Sambadrome which has a 90,000 seat capacity          Each year the Sambadrome, which was designed by revered architect Oscar Niemeyer and constructed in 1984, is packed with carnival fans         The second day of the parade lasted well into the early hours of Tuesday morning and features performers from the samba Aacademicos do Salgueiro samba school         This woman appears to be dressed as some from of clock tower and is from the Unidos da Tijuca samba school         The men appearing during the parade appear to have been given safety equipment such as protective glasses and hard hats         The 13 Samba schools spend much of the previous 12 months getting ready for the festival where they get just an hour to entertain the public and wow judges          Many of the Samba schools are based in Rio\u0027s poorest districts and have some 70,000 volunteers working on the projects         However, officials in the city\u0027s government have slashed the amount of public money that is invested          The performances normally start around 9pm and carry on all night until dawn in front of packed crowds          Many of the performances criticised Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro  and his hard-line government          Many of the Samba schools are facing economic uncertainty after the city\u0027s government slashed their funding          Each of the samba schools takes a theme which they base their costumes on and spend months preparing their performances         The carnival winners will be announced during a special television show to be broadcast on Ash Wednesday          Each year, more than 500,000 people travel to Rio for the carnival which marks the start of Lent          The Rio festivities are probably only rivaled by those which take place in New Orleans for Mardi Gras          This float took on the theme of a circus, whichi was rather appropriate for a carnival          Thousands of men and women perform each year in the Rio carnival.

Lucian Freud’s etchings bore me senseless, Francis Bacon barely doodled, but Hockney is a graphic master. His retrospective of a life of portrait drawing is the most dazzling display of his art I have ever seen.Forget the rants about smoking, or the personality that has always made him so lovable. Hockney here is not a star but a stare. In self-portraits drawn with a steady black line, he eyeballs himself in the mirror, mercilessly seeing lank hair and a skinny body. He draws his own eyes through the unforgiving lenses of his spectacles. It’s uncomfortable to stand close to those eyes – the sense of Hockney sizing you up is almost oppressive. This series was made in 1983, when he was still blond, but he can see himself getting older. What does the future hold? The intensity of Hockney’s self-inspection, fag in mouth, bears comparison with Rembrandt. When an artist looks so hard into the mirror, we share what they see – we are invited into the undisguised truth.Hockney has been looking into the mirror since he was a teenager. In drawings and a lithograph from the 1950s he scrutinises a serious, sensitive youth in a brown pullover, with brown hair. (He’s already got stylish glasses, though.) These self-portraits done between the ages of 17 and 19 prove Hockney had immense ability before he went to the Royal College of Art. But what makes this exhibition so staggering is the picture it builds of a man who has never stopped learning. The reason drawing suits Hockney is that it lets him test himself. His lack of complacency is what makes him so beguiling.Picasso is his restless teacher. In 1973-4 Hockney portrayed them together in a fantasy scene that emulates Picasso’s Vollard Suite. Pablo sits on one side of a table in a stripy top, while Hockney faces him, nude, to be sketched. His pubic hair fluffs up between his legs. It’s a wonderful dream – to be Picasso’s nude – but Artist and Model could just as well have been called Master and Pupil. Folded curtains and a view of a French street are defined in thin, strong black ink lines in the style of Picasso’s portrait of Igor Stravinsky. It’s very hard to draw as simply as that. Picasso got the manner from Raphael. Hockney has the same confidence. And like Picasso, he plays games. This is the lesson of the master: you need to change style constantly in the search for an elusive truth.Since the 1960s, Hockney has done just that in portraits of three of his closest friends: Celia Birtwell, Gregory Evans and Maurice Payne. Each gets their own generous space. Birtwell’s beauty is recorded with seemingly endless stylistic fun. Sketches from the 1970s depict the textile and fashion designer, who was married to Ossie Clark, looking like a glam dream in swanky dresses and romantic hair, drawn in soft colours. She poses with a cigarette, or lies back in Paris in a slip, her face a mask. Maybe it’s her enigmatic aura that made him draw her so often. Yet she doesn’t hold anything back – Celia, Nude, which dates from 1975, has her look away while she lets Hockney draw her breasts orange and blue.Gregory, too, let Hockney draw him naked in 1975. In Gregory Leaning Nude, he looks like a Florentine youth painted by Botticelli. He rests his slim body against the wall, looking into space from under long tawny locks while Hockney records his pink penis. The following year, he closes his eyes for a lithograph in which he’s wearing just gym socks. But while Hockney can make Evans beautiful, he has also drawn him in states of scary vulnerability. In two studies from 1988 he seems damaged. In a 1999 portrait his hair is mangled and sweaty, his face desperately emaciated. Evans is Hockney’s everyman, undergoing life’s changes, who, in these works of art, experiences extreme highs and lows. A loving study of him asleep adds to the novel of his life.With Payne, the theme is time. In 1967, Hockney drew this handsome man as a dandy. By 1984, he was ageing and meditative. And through the 1990s, Hockney recorded each mark of time, in frank studies of a beautiful man getting on in years.As have they all. In 2019, Hockney brought their portraits up to date for this show. Their latest ink portraits are shown together to intensely haunting effect. It’s like the end of a film where you see the characters as they are now, long after their youthful adventures. Evans is in a tracksuit. Birtwell still has joy in her eyes.Ah, and young David. What has become of him? A video shows his wrinkled hand leafing through an album of sketches from last year in Normandy. Their freshness and variety is staggering as he leaps easily from the most direct observation of wood-framed houses to abstract jeux d’esprit.Wherever he is, you see, Hockney’s true home is his sketchbook. Drawing lets him hold what he loves. A room is given to his acute drawings of his mother, again resembling Rembrandt as he contemplates her in old age. Another set of images show himself to himself on his iPad – smoking and staring, screwing up his face in a caricature of rage.This exhibition reveals, with total freshness, an artist full of curiosity about himself and other people. Hockney rejoices in invention but never loses sight of his simple subject: being alive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aadd0035bd81875aff6aa190bcb26b0ea8c8ba94/0_324_5512_3307/master/5512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49160bc60bfcf4ec7ffe4df52beb6ee0","title":"holy housing developments how god is getting into construction","story":"Cash-strapped churches are raising money by inviting developers to build pricey flats on their turf. Is this the promised land for faith buildings – or a deal with the devil?High-end Bosch appliances, carpeted bedrooms, generous storage – and a three-storey wooden cross right outside the window. The apartments of Upper Place sound like any other new development in east London, sold on their edgy urban location and proximity to artisanal coffee shops, except these particular flats come with the added promise of bringing you closer to God. Other blocks might boast a private gym, but here you can pop downstairs to see the priest for a workout of a more spiritual kind.Sandwiched between a Tesco Express and a used-furniture shop, this new holy housing project is a surprising thing to encounter on a high street in Hackney. The supersized wooden cross is bolted to a gigantic white concrete frame, projecting out in front of rows of balconies adorned with balustrades tinted in a range of bright Tooty Frootie colours, as if a nod to a stained-glass window. A big TV screen at the entrance advertises the lively services of the Upper Clapton United Reformed Church that await within, conducted by the charismatic white-suited Rev John Macaulay in a large ground-floor space, illuminated from above by a cross-shaped skylight. The German modernist architect Mies van der Rohe was fond of saying: “God is in the details.” Here, he’s writ large all across the building.This unlikely edifice is the latest project by Thornsett, a developer with a track record of partnering with church groups to maximise their assets, building housing on their land to pay for new church facilities. Ten minutes down the road, the company is nearing completion on Hackney Gardens, a scheme of 58 luxury apartments in the grounds of the Church of St John-at-Hackney, along with a community centre and new public space, appropriately named Prodigal Square. “Your new secret … in a natural oasis of calm,” coos the brochure, listing two-bedroom flats for £825,000.For more pious members of the congregation, such partnerships might sound like a deal with the devil. But, in these straitened times for churches across the country, it looks increasingly like a necessary bargain, and one that comes with added benefits. Using money generated by the sale of the swanky homes in Hackney Gardens, match-funded by a Heritage Lottery grant, the handsome grade II*-listed Georgian church is undergoing a £5m refurbishment by doyen of minimalism, John Pawson, and acclaimed stage designer, Es Devlin, to be reborn as an atmospheric space for church services, concerts and community events. Under the leadership of hipster worker’s jacket-wearing Rev Al Gordon, the church has already seen the likes of Coldplay, Ed Sheeran and Robbie Williams play there, while a brewery and restaurant help fund a weekly lunch club for the homeless.The flexible nature of the English planning system has allowed for a degree of negotiation in projects like this, whereby as long as the developer can demonstrate community benefit – in the provision of a community centre or active programme of community services – they are permitted to build less affordable housing than would usually be required. At St John’s, eight out of the 57 units will be affordable, while none of the Clapton flats are, as Thornsett was allowed to make a contribution to affordable housing elsewhere in the borough instead.“It can be a difficult argument,” says Thornsett director, Bernadette Cunningham. “Many church congregations rightly want to see more affordable housing, but they have to understand that it doesn’t pay for itself. Of course, housing is important, but so are all of these other needs, like nursery care, dementia groups, Alcoholics Anonymous and death cafes.” As she often tells hesitant congregations, nervous about building anything above their church: “Land is scarce, and God is not making any more.”A number of Thornsett’s projects are now on display in the atmospheric crypt of St Mary Magdalene in Paddington, one of London’s greatest 19th-century churches (recently used to film Les Misérables), in a new exhibition of 23 contemporary faith buildings organised by the AF. Titled Congregation, it paints a fascinating picture of the ingenious ways that churches, mosques, synagogues and more are responding to the different pressures they face, be it dwindling congregations and leaky postwar buildings, or the need to accommodate thousands of worshippers and a herd of sacred cattle, as a new Hare Krishna Haveli in Hertfordshire necessitated.“All the buildings seem to strive towards a sense of timelessness,” says Architecture Foundation director, Ellis Woodman, who co-curated the exhibition with Rosie Gibbs-Stevenson, “yet they are also a reflection of their immediate social, economic and environmental pressures.” Green credentials loom large as an expression of spiritual values, while commercial realities are plain to see in projects that flank Victorian steeples with residential blocks. While many of the Christian examples are having to cross-subsidise their building’s refurbishment or replacement with a range of secular uses, the exhibition shows mosques in Cambridge and the East End expanding to accommodate growing congregations, with powerful architectural expressions that reflect a modern British Muslim identity. Shahed Saleem’s Shahporan Masjid on Hackney Road is a particularly striking example, avoiding the usual pastiche to create something that fits with its context but is also distinctively other. As Saleem has said: “The buildings should be reflective of Britishness, and with that I mean us accepting, acknowledging, and taking on the fact we are a product of this country, of this place, and we can’t pretend that we’re not.”Elsewhere, a sample of John Pawson’s sumptuously carved dark wooden panelling for the Hackney Church is displayed near a model of The Lighthouse, an £11m beacon for Holy Trinity in Swiss Cottage, designed by Haworth Tompkins. Presenting a six-storey-high rose window to the street, it will contain a gym, street cafe, rehearsal rooms, teaching spaces, sheltered accommodation and staff housing, alongside the 500-seat worship and performance space – roofed with a geometric ceiling that mirrors the rose window on the facade. It is the kind of church as mixed-use community hub that many are trying to ersify towards in order to boost attendance and ensure use beyond Sunday mornings alone.It is exactly the path that St Mary Magdalene has followed, too, as a scene of half-term chaos revealed last week. The grade I-listed church was recently extended with a jewel-like cafe and performance space by Dow Jones Architects, providing essential catering and toilet facilities and creating a vital community asset for the second-most deprived ward in London. Witnessing the riotous scenes of crafts and games taking place beneath the soaring gothic arches and painted ceilings in the church’s monumental nave, it’s hard to deny, even as a cynical atheist, that faith buildings have a useful future in them yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfb6291ebe2e1689aee8e638500e894ae3a923da/0_366_1363_817/master/1363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a60142621e853aefad0cd0eeea30efe9","title":"extreme selfies the photographer who goes out on a limb in pictures minkkinen","story":"Arno Rafael Minkkinen has been using his body as his subject for five decades.

Just over 17 years ago, I was one of the millions of people around the world who marched against the Iraq war. The energy on the streets in London was electrifying it was the biggest protest in British history. The government, I naively thought at the time, would have to listen. The government, of course, did not listen. A few weeks later, Iraq was illegally invaded. This great betrayal galvanised a few of my friends into activism. But it left me, and many others, disillusioned at best and apathetic at worst. My student idealism withered and I lost confidence in the democratic process.In the past few days, however, something strange has started to happen: I have begun to feel hopeful about politics again. In the US, the growing success of Bernie Sanders’ grassroots movement in the Democractic presidential nominations has restored my faith in people power. It has made me dare to hope that a second Donald Trump term may not be as inevitable as I previously thought it was. It made me dare to hope that a more equitable America – and, by extension, a more equitable world – really might be around the corner.Whoa, you might say. Slow down! Sanders has only won three primaries so far. Yes, he may have won Nevada by a landslide. Yes, he may have emerged as the clear Democratic frontrunner but there is still a long way to go before he wins the nomination, let alone the general election. Even if we do see a President Sanders, it is not as if he would be able to enact ambitious policies, such as Medicare for All, overnight. He may not be able to enact his policies at all.This may be true. But do not underestimate the magnitude of what is unfolding in the US. Politicians love to throw around the word “movement” precious few have actually built one. Sanders, however, has brought together a multiracial, multifaith, multigenerational coalition of people who are fighting for the collective good in a country long obsessed with inidual gain. One of the most heartening things to come out of the Nevada caucuses was the overwhelming support Sanders got from members of the Culinary Workers Union. This support was a big deal because the union’s leadership has been vocal in its criticism of Sanders, warning that his healthcare proposal would “end” the exceptional healthcare coverage it had worked so hard to negotiate. However, as many union members told the press, Sanders’ plan to replace private insurance with universal health care was a major reason they were behind him. They wanted their friends and family to have access to the same great healthcare they had. Their support was the very embodiment of the Sanders campaign slogan: “Not me. Us.”Sanders’ detractors frequently complain about how “stubborn” he is. They don’t seem to understand that this is precisely why people like him. Trust in traditional institutions is at a record low but Sanders is that rare politician: one you feel you can trust. He has been true to his values his entire life, even when it is has been politically inexpedient. He has spoken out about US imperialism. He opposed the Iraq war. And he has been one of the very few American politicians to acknowledge the humanity of the Palestinian people. As a half-Palestinian, I can’t tell you how important and unprecedented it is to hear a mainstream American politician stand up for Palestinian rights.At a time when everything is for sale, Sanders is a powerful symbol of someone who can’t be bought. He has refused to take billionaires’ money, relying on grassroots support. His snowballing success is a much-needed reminder that big money can buy you a lot of ads, but big ideas are what win you people’s hearts. Sanders may not win the presidency, but he has built a movement that the establishment will find it very hard to stop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd966717008475d8a715dc75a2f0d72059870bbd/0_84_5286_3171/master/5286.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7385cd3a6141e263e471fa9336c3ec55","title":"historian future brexit opinions","story":"We’re constantly being invoked to shore up people’s opinions on Brexit. Here’s what we really think about it (at the moment)Historians of the future will not judge us kindly. Historians of the future will vindicate us. (Historians of the future can feel their ears burning.) In the context of the debate around Brexit, and the past few years of turbulent political developments around the world, it feels like future historians have never been more present.The appeal to the future historian is a common trope in times of crisis. The historian of the future is pictured as a horrified figure, peering back at the madness of contemporary life. So, people claim that the future historian will be baffled, or alarmed, or confused by what is going on right now. Historians of the future, who are rational adults, will not understand why we behave in the ridiculous ways that we do. This functions as a sort of gentle chiding, a call for us to be more sensible.This always makes me feel slightly defensive on behalf of those historians, who are assumed to be so guileless. In reality, those future historians won’t be so confused. They will probably look at economic inequality, political disenfranchisement, a volatile media with low levels of trust, decades of complicated relations between Britain and the other European nations, decolonisation, deindustrialisation, xenophobia, racism, and the legitimate concerns of middle-class, home counties homeowners, and make an argument to explain why the referendum went the way it did. Historians have distance, and documents. They might see things that we can never understand in the moment, but they won’t be any more baffled than we are now.It is also worth pointing out that historians are around right now, working right up to the very recent past. We have lots of ideas about why Brexit happened, and about the wider and longer context. When people reach for historical parallels today, historians can also tell you why these things often do not make sense – it is not historians, mostly, who are drawing analogies between Brexit and the Reformation. But the people who invoke historians of the future are less keen on listening to actually existing historians today.We should also remember that historians of the future will have their own opinions about Brexit: why it happened, whether it was worth it, who it served and how. Invoking historians of the future often supposes that they will be neutral actors. But this is not how historians work. We come to the archive with our own ideas and perspectives. And the archive is often overflowing, and we cannot possibly read everything. We have to make choices about which narratives we emphasise. Those choices are shaped by our existing principles and the ways that we already understand the world: what schoolchildren are taught to call “bias”. Historians of the future will probably already have strong ideas about Brexit: their narratives and stories will not necessarily be less neutral or more trustworthy than ours.It is worth asking, too: what do we actually want from the historians of the future? Do we really want them to weigh up the evidence, and to judge us based on the facts and only facts? I don’t think so. What we want is to be proved right. This is the other function of the “historian of the future”: to reassure us that our interpretation is correct, and that we truly understand what is going on. When people say that historians of the future will argue X, Y or Z, what they are doing is arguing X, Y or Z themselves, but clothing that argument in the moral and intellectual authority of some mythic future scholar.This is not only misjudged because historians are fallible and partial it also shows a naive confidence in the idea that historians of the future will all ever agree. We have not, as a profession, settled on a single agreed narrative of the causes or consequences of any event in history, from the Battle of Hastings to the Battle of Britain. Nor should we: historians do not seek to write a single account of what happened, but to explore and offer up multiple overlapping, contested narratives of the past. Historians of the future will not explain Brexit once and for all they won’t settle on a single story, any more than we can today.Perhaps most of all, appeals to historians of the future are self-aggrandising in the context of the present. We like to believe that the choices we make are so important that they shift the tides of history – that the actions we take, like a butterfly’s wings, can change the future. We want to sit in the spotlight of historical attention. We want reassurance that our time is special and distinct, and that future historians will care about us: we will not be consigned to the condescension of posterity.Undoubtedly, historians will write many books about Brexit, its causes and its consequences. But historians will write about lots of other things that happened, too, from our shopping habits, to our orce rates, to the football teams that we support. Historians don’t only care about big events like Brexit: everyone is living through history, all the time.• Charlotte Lydia Riley is a historian of contemporary Britain at the University of Southampton"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c48d95db8954272066812cf63a99de42a5256165/0_136_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03b6ca10cb038eda6783c1e67b6d00c0","title":"levelling up life expectancy tories government health","story":"If the government is serious about doing right by its new voters, it needs to rewire the way it thinks about spendingWe have all got so used to life expectancy ticking steadily ever upwards that many of us had started taking that progress for granted, yet a new report by the legendary epidemiologist and former government adviser Sir Michael Marmot provides a timely bucket of cold water. For women living in the poorest parts of Britain, lives are now getting shorter both men and women are also spending longer in chronic ill health towards the end of their lives, meaning the time they do have left is painfully constrained. The gears are crunching into reverse, according to his findings for the independent charity the Health Foundation.Here, then, is the really big litmus test of this government’s commitment to its new electoral coalition, because the crude political reality is that it will often be Boris Johnson’s new voters dying before their time. People in the so-called “red wall” seats captured by the Tories at the last election can expect to live for only 60.9 years in good health compared with 65 years for those in Tory-held seats and 61.4 years in the places where Labour clung on. Marmot can find no biological explanation for life expectancy falling – it’s not as if humans have just naturally hit a ceiling on how long we can live – and is explicit about identifying austerity, and the everyday hardship that followed, as the likely culprit. But he is also clear that simply declaring austerity to be over isn’t enough to reverse the tide. If there’s money to spend now, it needs to be spent on things that are not historically Tory priorities.So far Johnson’s government has been undeniably good at connecting culturally with ex-Labour voters who felt their party no longer understood them. These newfound red Tories are finally getting not just the Brexit they craved but the curbs on immigration and tough talk on terrorism or crime many of them wanted, while Labour is mired in battles over trans rights or Jeremy Corbyn’s lingering influence which can only push them further away. But that’s the easy bit, because socially conservative voters and traditional Tories have always met in the middle on these issues. The next step is the painful one because it means rewiring the way a Conservative administration naturally thinks and spends.Talk of levelling up the country is cheap but actually raising health outcomes in the deprived north up towards those of the south is a slow, unglamorous and expensive business that involves swallowing difficult truths about the relationship between poverty and sickness. It means accepting that people will inevitably struggle to make healthy choices when they’re reliant on tins from the food bank or run ragged from working three jobs – arguments that a certain kind of Tory tends to dismiss as excuses for failing to take personal responsibility – and reshaping welfare policy accordingly. It means ploughing money into cheap, stable and decent socially rented homes as well as helping first-time buyers priced out of London. It means a national strategy to reduce health inequalities, something Tony Blair’s government introduced and David Cameron’s quietly dropped. And it means hard choices between what the Tories’ more affluent traditional base in the south wants, versus what their new base in the north was promised at the election.The howls of pain greeting any suggested means of raising cash in next month’s budget – from raids on pension tax relief to scrapping the freeze on petrol duty – suggest many Tory MPs simply haven’t grasped the full implications of the promises their leader has been making. If they really mean what they say about reversing decades of decline in the north, then it’s going to cost, and no Conservative should need to be told that money doesn’t grow on trees. And if they didn’t really mean it, then every report like this one brings them one step closer to being found out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce767ab455e8807449a2738af53c48cbd28c69ed/0_197_4839_2904/master/4839.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ded577e8de3c647ea00a25ddf8f23e5","title":"sinn fein party two party system","story":"The party has smashed Ireland’s two-party system, bringing hope for a change to the old order – which is fighting to retain controlThis hysteria has several roots. Some evidently dislike the idea of a “northern” party holding power “down here”. Others, usually sotto voce, echo the view of the political correspondent John Drennan who once suggested that Sinn Féin supporters existed on a diet of “chips, Dutch Gold and batter burgers” – a nod to the party’s supporters being mainly working class. Despite crude efforts to paint it as part of the rise of the populist right, Sinn Féin’s success is a leftwing phenomenon. The party campaigned on the need for massive public investment to deal with a dire housing crisis and a crumbling health system. Sinn Féin has eschewed anti-immigrant rhetoric one of its TDs (MPs), Martin Kenny, suffered an arson attack after condemning racist activity. (The Irish far-right characterises Sinn Féin as “globalist”). The party supported both marriage equality and the repeal of laws outlawing abortion in recent referendums. Under proportional representation, Sinn Féin transfers also helped to elect members of smaller socialist parties.Critics have conjured up the prospect of Ireland becoming another Venezuela if Sinn Féin entered government. But these predictions sound hollow coming from politicians who presided over an actual economic collapse. Sinn Féin was simply best placed to benefit from voters still angry at the austerity period of 2008-2016 and disgusted that there could be almost 10,000 people homeless in a booming economy.Some suggest the party’s history renders it unsuitable for power. Though the Provisional IRA decommissioned its arsenal and disbanded in the mid-2000s, Sinn Féin honours the legacy of that organisation’s armed struggle. Its opponents argue that “shadowy” northern figures continue to direct party policy. There is no doubt that republican veterans retain huge influence within Sinn Féin. But references to the IRA’s campaign had little impact on the new voters attracted to the party. For them the recession is far more relevant than a conflict that ended 25 years ago.Ironically the partitionist nature of Irish politics also benefits Sinn Féin. Most voters in the Republic pay little attention to day-to-day northern politics. But what people are aware of is that since 2017 Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have been demanding that Sinn Féin return to government with the Democratic Unionist party in Belfast. It seems strange then to assert that it is unfit for power in the Republic. Indeed if the IRA army council is really running Sinn Féin, then how does DUP leader Arlene Foster (a woman whose father was actually shot by the IRA), share power with them in Northern Ireland?For many voters, particularly the young, the exclusion of Sinn Féin is more about the establishment protecting itself than morality. It is true that many of these voters cannot recall the Troubles neither indeed can some of Sinn Féin’s newly elected TDs. The party’s president, Mary Lou McDonald, herself did not join the organisation until after the IRA’s final ceasefire. But rather than not caring about the violence inflicted by the IRA, as some charge, many note that Sinn Féin’s critics seem solely concerned with republican activities, with no equivalent focus on violence carried out by British or loyalist forces. Since both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have roots in the revolution of 1919-21 and declare pride in the “old” IRA, their critiques of Sinn Féin’s past seem hypocritical.Sinn Féin’s recounting of the conflict is certainly partial. But it is also clearly a party that has been rewarded for involvement in a peace process most voters were not retrospectively endorsing the IRA’s war or demanding a united Ireland. The rise in British nationalist rhetoric since Brexit also had an impact, reminding voters that Britain had once denied self-determination to Ireland. Early in the election a government proposal to commemorate policemen who fought against the IRA during the revolutionary period also backfired spectacularly.Sinn Féin’s breakthrough has aroused hopes in thousands of voters that it represents something fundamentally different to the old order the frenzied efforts to keep it from power have reinforced this view. In 2009 Eoin Ó Broin, one of the most impressive among the party’s leadership, predicted that there might come a time when it would have to either prioritise national unity, perhaps by entering coalition with an establishment party, or make a serious effort to reshape politics to bring about an “independent democratic socialist Ireland”. Sinn Féin no longer says “socialist” in its literature and the more far-seeing of Ireland’s business community have been less hysterical about the election’s outcome than some commentators. Indeed Sinn Féin’s record in government in Belfast often reveals them to be ruthlessly pragmatic.However it plays out, the old party system in the Republic has been broken for good – another casualty of the great recession. But many of Sinn Féin’s new voters are likely to have no compunction in seeking other political homes if they feel their hopes for change are dashed.• Brian Hanley is a historian.

Even if it is not containable, it can still be slowedIt now appears almost inevitable that the new coronavirus outbreak will soon be identified as a global pandemic. There has been a surge in cases in Iran, South Korea and Italy, and incidents confirmed in numerous countries, in addition to the almost 80,000 cases seen in China. The World Health Organization argues that it is not a pandemic – spreading internationally in an uncontrolled way – because it is cautiously optimistic that China’s outbreak may have peaked thanks to the strict measures adopted by Beijing. Others say this is already a pandemic in all but name.The WHO’s hesitance may be partly due to its concern about the public reaction, as rational worries combine with limited medical knowledge, xenophobia and broader anxieties. “Using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear,” the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned on Monday. As concern spreads, economic effects are growing alongside the human toll. Stock markets have taken a hammering. Airlines are suffering, major international events are being cancelled, and companies dependent on Chinese-made components have halted production.How much worse could it get? “This might be bad,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday. The word “pandemic” brings to mind the devastation of the Black Death or Spanish flu. But not all pandemics are equal. The term tells us how a disease is spreading, not how deadly it will be. Spanish flu killed up to 100 million people as it swept the globe a century ago. According to one estimate, the 2009 swine flu pandemic killed up to 203,000 people – still lower than the toll linked to seasonal flu in many years.Panic and resignation are understandable responses to the declaration of a pandemic, but what is needed is vigilance and sensible action. It would still be possible to slow the disease’s spread, for example through bans on mass gatherings, or advice to vulnerable populations to isolate themselves – allowing more time to train medics, acquire supplies (hit by disrupted production in China as well as by panic-buying) and prepare extra beds, as well as to develop treatments and – hopefully – a vaccine. The priority for the public in countries such as the UK should be good hygiene and the observation of official advice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b27b38b5741dcace3188623572dee1e3f2084d/0_146_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3134c3d90564ffe4e221e35f304e2c10","title":"the end of farming rewilding intensive agriculture food safety","story":"For decades, the way we farm has been degrading land and destroying wildlife. Now there’s a revolution coming – but is it going to create more problems than it solves? By  Christopher de BellaigueIn the last years of the 20th century, Glenfeshie, a 17,000-hectare estate in the Scottish Highlands, was in steep decline. Decades of overgrazing by deer had reduced its hillsides to clipped lifelessness. Denied the protection afforded by tree roots, the banks of the River Feshie were losing soil each time it flooded, the water depositing silt downstream. Those few Scots pines that had survived the browsing of the deer were nearing the end of their lives soon there would be no seed source for the next generation.Between 1997 and 2006, ownership of Glenfeshie passed between three Danish businessmen – and with it a self-destructive business model. Only by maintaining very high numbers of livestock could the flow of fee-paying deerstalkers armed with rifles be ensured, but because of the rising cost of gamekeepers and estate upkeep, Glenfeshie’s sporting operations were still making a loss. All the while, the pine martens, mountain hares and hen harriers for which the Highlands are a natural habitat were being crowded out by the deer on which the model depended.In 2006, the billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, the last and richest of the three Danes, whose fashion empire includes the online retail giant Asos, bought Glenfeshie. Urged on by his man on the ground, a former land agent called Thomas MacDonell, he intensified efforts that had started under his predecessor to bring down deer numbers, with a view to allowing the estate’s woodland to recover and bioersity to return.Glenfeshie is the biggest of the 12 Scottish estates that Povlsen and his wife Anne began acquiring and rewilding in 1996 – in the process spending a total of £70m and becoming the country’s largest private landowners. Although the term “rewilding” – meaning an approach to conservation that allows nature a free rein – has been in currency since 1990, many traditional landowners and gamekeepers continue to spurn both the term and the idea behind it. In the Highlands, rewilding implies that the concept of the country estate as a setting for people of quality to shoot game has had its time. Never very profitable – the Highlands were where rich people came to spend money they had made elsewhere – in recent decades, the sporting estates have become still less viable. As one veteran gamekeeper told me, very few of them actually make money.By 2013, MacDonell and his team had culled 8,000 deer at Glenfeshie, and his local opponents, among them a neighbouring deerstalking enterprise, had camped on the moral high ground. “When they shoot deer they call it sport,” MacDonell said wryly when I visited him last September, “and when we shoot deer they call it slaughter. Also, they claimed it would take hundreds of years for the woodland to regenerate.”We were standing on a track overlooking the River Feshie. On either side, young Scots pines displayed bright green needles against the glowing heather. Among the pines grew rowans hung with scarlet berries, and bilberry bushes whose leaves would be fair game for white moth caterpillars in spring. There were more new trees on the far side of the Feshie, binding the banks and spreading up the hillside. MacDonell smiled. “As you can see, our opponents were wrong.”Over the past 20 years or so, from South America to the Danube basin, ad hoc coalitions of politicians, activists and conscience-stricken billionaires (whose core activities, such as Povlsen’s clothing business, are often less than environmentally friendly), have rewilded millions of acres of mostly failed agricultural and grazing land. Their guiding philosophy – that we should leave the land alone – upends the long dominant view that land should be cleared, ploughed and wrung ever more efficiently for food.Because many of the practitioners are billionaires, and because the landscapes they have returned to nature are (no matter who owns them on paper) our cherished inheritance, and because of a deeply held tradition of depending on the land for food, rewilding attracts controversy. But it is based on a longer view of the planet’s health, which dictates that we use the land not only to feed ourselves in a more environmentally sustainable way, but also to capture greenhouse gases, save endangered species and offer ourselves an occasional break from traffic and hand-sanitisers – that is, to leave town and enjoy the works of nature.The regeneration of Glenfeshie is such a work. Across the hills that ide the Feshie’s catchment from that of the neighbouring river, the Tromie, MacDonell and his team have planted hundreds of thousands of pines, birches, willows and other native trees over the past decade. A few years from now, these stems will develop into a barrier against erosion, a carbon sink and a habitat for distinctive Highland birds such as the capercaillie and ptarmigan. Birds and the wind distribute seeds, while the estate’s deer, whose concentration has been brought down from 40 per sq km to one, are no longer numerous enough to eat all the young shoots. The increased vegetation also provides food for the pine martens, red squirrels and mountain hares that MacDonell is seeing in rising numbers, while the population of endangered birds such as crossbills and crested tits has also risen.For whose benefit? The Povlsens’ Scottish operations currently make an annual loss of £3m, but it is hoped that they will turn a profit by 2027, thanks to clients paying to stay in luxurious accommodation, enjoy exquisitely underdone venison and wander the restored landscapes. When rewilding plans were first revealed, critics of Scotland’s concentrated land ownership – half of the Scottish countryside is owned by around 450 people – expressed fears that Glenfeshie might become a reservation for the rich, but these have been partially allayed by letting ordinary hikers walk across the glens for free.If rewilding seems like a rich person’s indulgence, this is because its economic viability is unproven. It is also a misnomer, for whether by getting rid of tens of thousands of sheep in Patagonia or introducing a living species as a surrogate for an extinct one – Sayaguesa cattle in place of aurochs in Croatia’s Velebit Mountains, for instance – rewilding requires more human intervention than its name suggests. The tourism it offers is limited a rewilded area cannot accommodate many people without undermining its own existence. By erting investment towards repairing landscapes and contributing to the public weal, rewilders are taking money away from conventional economic activities. And this is where its impact will be felt in British farming. Barely a decade ago, the notion that land should be managed in order to ensure planetary wellbeing had few takers among farmers whose raison d’etre was to fill human bellies at the lowest possible cost. But this is the proposition that is now poised to determine the future of farming.Memories of resilience in adversity were inevitably a factor in the growth of intensive farming. When the country was blockaded during the second world war and the nation’s farmers were told to convert scrub and pasture to sown fields, arable land doubled. In peacetime, the patriotic drive for self-sufficiency continued, as the population soared and farmers cleared more land in order to produce more food. Between 1946 and 1963, an average of 3,000 miles of hedgerows were stripped out each year.After Britain joined the European Community in 1973, its farmers received subsidies that rewarded production and – when that led to wasteful surpluses – simply for holding farmland. In 2017, some £2.73bn was disbursed in this way. For decades, farmers justified their subsidies by citing the continuing need for British self-sufficiency in food production, despite the fact that in many cases they were only solvent thanks to European subsidies. During that time, there was still only minimal awareness that the relentless drive for higher yields through intensive methods might be bad for the environment. The few farmers who questioned the prevailing wisdom faced ostracism by their peers.So Charles Burrell discovered in 2000, when he declared defeat after a decade and a half of intensive farming at Knepp, his 1,400-hectare estate in the south of England. Burrell had invested in automatic feeding systems, state-of-the-art combine harvesters and gallons of fertilisers and pesticides in order to coax more milk from his cows and higher yields from the stodgy Sussex clay. But for 13 of his 15 years in charge, Burrell sank more money into the farm than he received in revenues, and the estate was £1.5m overdrawn. In February 2000, he told his employees that he was coming out of farming.“The farm workers … left the office grimly shaking their heads,” his wife, Isabella Tree, recalled in Wilding, the book she wrote about the couple’s experiences. But if liquidation was shocking, Burrell’s decision to seek public money to turn his farm into a “bioerse wilderness”, and his aim to turn a profit through tourism and organic meat, seemed downright perverse.In 2001, starting with a small section of the estate and gradually expanding as funding became available, Burrell stopped ploughing the land and spraying it with chemicals. Removing internal fences allowed the wild Exmoor ponies and Tamworth pigs he introduced to browse and rootle over large distances, their disruptions creating habitats for other animals and plants. Dung beetles ed into delicious organic cowpats left by longhorn cattle that hadn’t been fed wormers and parasiticides voles colonised the roots of a dead oak that under the previous regime would have been felled in the interests of tidiness. The summer of 2002 revealed wildflowers with delightful names such as bird’s-foot trefoil and lady’s bedstraw that hadn’t been seen in such numbers for a generation, along with a profusion of insects, which produced a continuous thrum – “something”, in Tree’s words, “we hadn’t even known we’d been missing”.Much bigger and more ambitious rewilding schemes than Knepp are currently underway across Europe. But whatever the challenges that face international conservationists who are restoring the largely abandoned Coa Valley of northern Portugal, or those at work in Swedish Lapland (population: 1,000), mass hostility from the locals isn’t one of them. Rewilding in the densely populated Sussex Weald was a tougher sell.In August 2003, Burrell invited local farmers to Knepp with the aim of converting them to the project. As he laid out his vision of fields and hedges devolving into scrub and wetland, his audience erupted with anger. “It wasn’t simply that our neighbours (including some other members of the family) thought this wasn’t right for them,” Tree wrote. “It was more visceral … an affront to the efforts of every self-respecting farmer, an immoral waste of land, an assault on Britishness itself.”By 2008, Knepp was suffused by weeds such as ragwort, whose vivid yellow flowers are great for pollinators but can kill livestock in the rare event that they are eaten in large amounts. In a letter to the West Sussex County Times, a critic resorted to doggerel to denounce Knepp’s “ragwort shame, spread like the plague, and who’s to blame?”When I visited Knepp after heavy rain last autumn, what had been arable fields were a sodden mishmash of young trees, billowing hedges and fleabane stalks, naturally occurring growths that have enhanced Knepp’s capacity for carbon capture. In 2011, Burrell had deliberately collapsed the banks of the River Adur where it runs through his property in order to create the kind of accommodating plain that floods harmlessly after heavy rain.Burrell’s flood-plain and the ramblers’ paths that criss-cross the estate constitute what the government defines as “public goods”: services provided to society without material profit. They have helped quiet much of the local opposition to Knepp’s rewilding. Meanwhile, wildlife tourism has turned Knepp into a successful business that employs more people than it did when it was a farm. Springtime overnighters snuggling down in a luxury treehouse after a soak in the open-air, wood-fired Swedish Hikki bathtub may hear nightingales serenading their consorts they can take home organic Knepp chops to remember the free-running Tamworths by. Tree’s book Wilding has sold so well that its author recently appeared on the BBC’s Desert Island Discs, an indication of impending national treasure status.Burrell is nowadays asked about his methods by farmers from around the country. But Knepp is not easy to emulate its success lies partly in its rarity and its aristocratic charm – Burrell is a baronet who lives in a rinky-dink castle. Nor are the farmers who consult him necessarily converts to rewilding. As Burrell himself says: “These guys may not like it, but they don’t know what the future holds and are being forced to engage.”At present, in addition to the EU subsidy they receive for holding agricultural land, farmers who provide public goods, such as fostering wildflowers and mitigating flood risk, can claim EU environmental subsidies. But take-up has been patchy between 2014 and 2017, environmental disbursals fell from £489m to £399m, a reflection of what farmers call the government’s overly prescriptive approach.The brutal fact is that government policy is about to get a lot more prescriptive. With Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, the government is scrapping the subsidy system which has kept British farming in stasis for years – and on which the livelihoods of many thousands depend. Under the agriculture bill currently before parliament, subsidies will be redirected at public goods alone. If a farmer does not provide such services, they will have to live off sales of their produce. This may not be a problem for the UK’s bigger farming companies, but impossible for many of the smaller family-owned enterprises whose annual subsidy is currently all that keeps them from insolvency.Hence the queue of worried farmers outside Burrell’s door. Knepp may hold the secret to rehabilitating the tarnished name of British farming. The more candid of the country’s farmers admit that they have suffered a calamitous fall in public esteem. From being the devoted fillers of the nation’s larders and the custodians of rural heritage, farmers, as one lamented to me, are increasingly seen as people who “take public money while raping the land”.Intensive arable farming is designed to raise yields and eliminate pests and disease. The more fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and fungicides are used, the bigger the harvests. Back in the chemical-free, weed-infested 1940s, Charles Burrell’s great-grandfather was lucky if he got two tonnes of wheat per hectare. Nowadays, farmers using high-yielding varieties would expect to harvest 10 tonnes of wheat per hectare, usually after applying pesticides, ammonium nitrate fertiliser, and a sprinkling of Roundup – a weedkiller found to have caused non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma among farmers. Overlooking their carcinogenic properties, the right chemicals – and the right weather – bring amazing results. In 2015, a farmer from Northumberland posted a yield of 16.52 tonnes per hectare, winning him a place in the Guinness Book of Records.For all the role that chemicals have played in improving yields, creating a loyal customer base among many of Britain’s 17,000-odd farms, there is a growing appreciation of the long-term environmental damage they cause. With repeated application over several years, chemicals kill the tiny mycorrhizal fungi that supply roots with water and nutrients, as well as earthworms that provide aeration and improve drainage.Guided by Dieter Helm, an Oxford economist who advises the government on farming policy, the political establishment has become decidedly sceptical of the old benign image of British farming. Last year, Helm called for the “full scale of the disaster of British agriculture” to be recognised, adding that “no other economic activity combines such a perverse set of incentives, or produces so little value for its true costs”.Even sheep-farming, celebrated by William Wordsworth as a symbol of rural plenitude, is nowadays described as an ecological disaster by writers and activists such as George Monbiot, who argues that the only hope for Britain’s “sheep-wrecked” hills is to reforest them and get rid of ruminants altogether.Converts to the new scepticism include Michael Gove, who, as environment secretary in Theresa May’s government, had a big hand in drafting the agriculture bill currently being scrutinised by MPs. Even the National Farmers Union has committed its members to going carbon-neutral by 2040 – though that goal may only be attainable through as yet undeveloped carbon capture technologies.The agriculture bill sits snugly alongside the government’s environment bill, another Gove baby, which had its first parliamentary reading in January and will enshrine the so-called “polluter pays” principle, according to which dirty industries are penalised at source. No longer can farmers who use chemicals that run into rivers expect water companies and the fishing industry to pick up the bill. Instead, the use of chemicals will be priced according to the greenhouse gases that are emitted while making them and the cost of clearing up the mess they cause – though the vexed question of exactly how the costs will be spread has yet to be resolved.The change that is coming over farming can be summarised in simple economic terms. Intensive agriculture prioritises a bumper harvest – the annual idend – while the new approach emphasises the preservation of the initial capital – the land itself. For a glimpse of how this new investment priority will affect British farming, it suffices to visit those progressives who have already, to varying degrees, made it their own.One afternoon last September, John and Paul Cherry invited me on to their Hertfordshire farm to show how to regenerate damaged soil. Until 10 years ago, each autumn the brothers would laboriously turn over lifeless slabs of clay, which needed to be pulverised with a power harrow before sowing could begin. Then they would douse the land with chemicals to coax forth an unwilling wheat crop. “It was as if we were in a battle with nature,” Paul said.In the 1990s, following innovators in the US midwest, a handful of British farmers went organic or stopped ploughing the soil to make a seed bed (so-called “no-tillers”). In 2010, the Cherrys followed suit, planting cover crops such as clover to reduce soil erosion and lock in carbon over the winter, and cutting their use of chemicals. “That brought us much closer to what nature would have us do,” said John as he poured some crumbling, friable soil reverentially into my hand, pausing to point out some “lovely” wormholes. “It’s a miniature rainforest,” he went on, “with more living things in it than there are people on the planet, full of bacteria and protozoa that are feasting off each other and interacting with the roots of the plant.”Standing on black, peaty ground in the shadow of Ely Cathedral, Clarke pointed out his neighbour’s field, which had been ploughed and was bare up to the dyke that ides the two properties. Clarke’s side, by contrast, featured a 10-metre margin of fodder radishes and wildflowers, a combination that provides pollen for bees and seeds for the grey partridges and corn buntings whose food sources have been depleted by intensive farming. When Clarke was a child, his father farmed the same land using intensive methods. Back then, almost the only wildlife to be seen was “thousands of rabbits.”From Ely, I drove south-east to a farm in Suffolk where Brian and Patrick Barker showed me how they are preparing for the introduction of the “polluter pays” laws. One of the cousins’ fields had been split into two strips, the first left bare after harvest, the second planted with phacelia, rye and radish. Over the winter, these “catch-crops” are left in the ground, where they capture the residual potash and nitrates from last year’s crop in their roots and stop them polluting nearby streams. At the end of the trial period, a comparison will be done between run-off from the two strips, and the catch-crops’ efficacy will be measured. Under the government’s new subsidy regime, environmentalism and economics will – in theory – perfectly align.The Barkers have started bringing livestock on to their fields to provide natural fertiliser – a nod to the old practice of “mixed” farming, whereby farmers grew crops and kept livestock, which went out with intensive methods. Brian told me that he had listened to Isabella Tree’s book Wilding twice while he was manoeuvring his combine harvester around the fields. He found it interesting, “but if everywhere was Knepp we’d have a lot of wildlife and not a lot else”.Every British farmer I spoke to while researching this article has an opinion on what the Burrells have done at Knepp, even if it is to damn the enterprise as tokenistic and unproductive. Environmentally friendly regeneration still has formidable opponents, among them old-school intensive farmers and the agribusinesses that make seeds and chemicals, as well as some plant scientists. In their view, a single unpalatable truth trumps any number of bees and buntings – and that is the looming global dearth of food.For Bill Clark, the technical director of the National Institute of Plant Botany (Niab), a research institute funded by some of Britain’s biggest farming enterprises, this means increasing yields. Clark regards the dispute over whether soil should be productive or healthy as a distraction from the basic choice between being able to feed people or not. “If yields don’t rise,” he told me at Niab’s headquarters in Cambridge, “people in north Africa” – a major export market for European farmers – “won’t simply be unable to afford the wheat they need in order to live: there will be no wheat.”To Clark’s dismay, precisely at the point when Britain and the rest of Europe need a productivity spurt in order to export more to the world, yields have plateaued, thanks to what Clark called the “irrational dogma which says that technology is bad”.Clark is a believer in the power of science to improve the human lot. In his view we have become so blase about technological advance that we overlook the fact that science has saved countless people from starvation. He spoke with reverence of the revolution that highly fertile Japanese wheat wrought when it was crossed with European varieties in the 50s: “The plant halved in size but yields doubled.” Visit one of Niab’s walk-in growth chambers and you’ll see the newest miracle: wheat developed by using a gene from oats that confers immunity to the root disease known as take-all. The new strain can be sown in successive years on the same field without falling foul of the disease (conventional practice dictates that the way to avoid take-all is to plant wheat in rotation with different crops, which naturally lowers aggregate wheat production).It is possible that there is one particular sector of farmers who will not be overly affected by the new agriculture bill. Where economies of size combine with naturally fertile soil that hasn’t yet been destroyed by chemicals, intensive farming continues to be remunerative.Michael Sly’s family has been farming around the village of Thorney, near Peterborough, since the civil war, buying and selling land until Park Farm – as the Sly establishment is called – reached its present size of 1,600 hectares. Whether it is the annual service of thanksgiving he organises at harvest festival, the thousands who visit Park Farm on “open farm” weekend in June, or his chairmanship of the local history society, Sly enjoys the status of – his words – “a big commercial arable farmer”. And while he is proud of the margins he has set aside for bees and birds, Sly’s mission isn’t environmental services. It’s growing food.Sly’s professional vision is defined by his huge fields of sugar beet that stretch towards the horizon, his state-of-the-art tractors, seed drills and combine harvesters, each of which is worth “multiple tens of thousands of pounds”, and his contracts to supply premium grade wheat for national brands such as Weetabix and Mini-Cheddars. He regards wilding as relevant only to “a certain percentage of affluent society”, and his shiny new 2,000-tonne store – which bulged with grains when I visited – is a hymn to the mass market.Sly refuses to commit to techniques such as cover cropping or no-tillage that might reduce yields, and whose commercial viability is unproven. (For all the worms wriggling in their soils, the Cherry brothers’ farming operation is loss-making, and will probably remain so until subsidy reforms kick in.) Sly’s worry is that once Britain has left the EU, the government will remove tariffs on imported produce grown using neonicotinoids or GM, undercutting British farmers. (Britain already imports half its food. When UK oilseed rape yields plummeted following the neonicotinoid insecticide ban, the shortfall was made up by importing Canadian rapeseed oil that had been produced using the same insecticides.)If there is no discernible panic among your fellow shoppers in the supermarket, this is because the prospect of shortages seems so remote from today’s glut. Isabella Tree contrasts the calls of “retailers, agribusiness and farmers’ unions” for the production of more food with “the experiences of farmers like ourselves, driven out of business by … low commodity prices resulting from subsidies and over-production”. Governments of neither left or right dare contemplate measures, such as imposing VAT on food, that would encourage thrift.While the debate continues over the use of advanced genetic and chemical crop-enhancers, technology is opening a whole new direction for food production, which will take farming away from the farm. Robotics and drones are reducing the need for humans to be on the land, while vertical farming, in which vegetables can be grown in sunless warehouses using LED lighting, gene editing and metagenics – the engineering of specific enzymes or proteins – are coming up with new definitions of food. According to a recent report by the thinktank RethinkX, within 15 years the rise of cell-based meat, which is made of animal cells grown in a bioreactor, will bankrupt the US’s huge beef industry, at the same time removing the need to grow soya and maize for feed. By 2035, the report predicts, an area a quarter of the size of the continental US “will be freed for other uses”.Although South American countries such as Brazil and Paraguay are expected to add 11m hectares to the global agricultural inventory between 2018 and 2027, in part by destroying the rainforests, agriculture’s footprint in the developed world is already decreasing, with “more land now being abandoned from agriculture than converted to it”, according to a recent study by the University of Minnesota. Already, as parliament has heard, a lot of British hill farmers are not being replaced when they retire. As a child in London, I heard my mother’s stories of growing up as the daughter of farmers on the Canadian Prairies. There was no Roundup weedkiller, though I’m sure my mother and her siblings, bent double to pick weeds from a field of mustard, would have appreciated it. For my own children, urbanites to their bones, their grandmother’s upbringing must be hard to conceive. Farming is retreating even from the imaginative capacity of most Britons.That many farmers confess to being confused and worried about their future is hardly surprising. The new measures will have a seven-year phasing-in period, at the end of which some of the small farmers who have been unable to adapt will go bust. What is to stop their land being swallowed up by big intensive farmers who don’t rely on subsidies? Others, rather than manoeuvre themselves through the hoops erected by public goods, may decide to turn their land over to enterprises less favourable to dormice and goldfinches: go-karting, motorbike scrambling or parcel distribution.A sentiment I heard repeatedly runs like this: farmers will do whatever society wants them to do, but the sums (ie, the subsidies, or market forces) have to be right.Even if the claims contained in the RethinkX report are overblown, a transformation of the kind it outlines seems not only possible but desirable. When I met him last autumn in a converted warehouse, now a restaurant, in London’s Kings Cross, Tony Juniper, the government’s chief adviser on the natural environment and a former head of Friends of the Earth, described a future in which the cost of LED bulbs is more significant to farmers than a late frost, and Londoners think nothing of weekending among lynxes and beavers in a rewilded green belt.Britain’s farming community is a tiny minority whose public influence is in terminal decline, and is destined to shrink further as technology requires fewer and fewer people to muddy themselves for a living. “The killer irony” of the revolution in farming, said Juniper, in a building that used to receive sack upon sack of golden English wheat, “is that farmers may not be around to see it.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e239a2c90fa1259a7b261afa1903462090987682/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4aace71e51e6dc2b8b49766e9f12404","title":"bohai bay the chinese region disappearing inch by inch in pictures","story":"Farmland, abandoned seaside resorts and salt fields are slowly being claimed by the rising waters, with 100 million people predicted to be affected in China by 2050All photographs by Sean Gallagher for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38587b6535818d902273d4707bdd9905c2e979b9/0_275_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4c5c9565eb389fb5cb1279b150ca80c","title":"dior show opens with commentary on the patriarchy","story":"Designer uses sophisticated optics to pitch the brand as conscious and engagedBecause Christian Dior loved flowers and nature, he took the tulip as inspiration for his dress patterns and bottled the scent of lily of the valley as Diorissimo. But in the 21st century, the house he founded broadcasts its affections on a grander scale.Dior’s show began with the word “CONSENT” flashing in giant neon letters above the catwalk. On the day following Harvey Weinstein’s rape conviction, Chiuri said it was “an important word for now”.More illuminations read “PATRIARCHY KILLS LOVE”, and “WOMEN’S LOVE IS UNPAID LABOUR”, in a show space conceived as a collaboration with Claire Fontaine, an art collective who take neon signs, a symbol of the most direct form of commerce, and subvert them by unexpected juxtaposition. The Dior collaboration “revolves around the performative use of language typical of non-reformist feminism”, they explained.Models walked on a catwalk papered with pages from Le Monde newspaper, a detail inspired by a 1949 portrait of Henri Matisse by the Hungarian photographer Robert Capa of the artist drawing in his studio, the floor papered with newspapers. Claire Fontaine adopted the newspapered floor as a symbol of how the noise of the outside world affects the world of art.Backstage, Chiuri’s moodboard celebrated spirited women of the 1970s – from Bianca Jagger in a trousersuit to photos from the family album of the designer’s mother in a headscarf and flared jeans. The first model on to the catwalk had a pixie cut others had scarves wrapped around their long hair. They wore Bianca Jagger trousersuits, Annie Hall waistcoats and baker boy caps, tank tops and flares, ponchos and fringing.Backstage, Chiuri said the 1970s were “a time when women wanted to represent and be true to themselves, more than to fashion. As a woman designer, this is very important to me. Silhouette has always been central to Dior, because Christian Dior saw himself as an architectural designer. But one silhouette doesn’t work for all women.” The first six outfits in the show – a trouser suit, a jumpsuit, a dress, and the midi-skirt-and-blazer combination that has become a staple of modern Dior – all came in stretch knit.With its ornate carousels and genteel tree-lined avenues the Tuileries, first opened in 1564, is an icon of chic Parisian joie de vivre. Dior will finance several projects, beginning with the reopening of a wooded area home to 116 trees of four species. A Dior statement said the project showed a wish to be “an agent of change for the ecosystems of tomorrow, whether natural or cultural”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165c44900bb5317fd698b3f60eb686d223cb02b5/0_29_8333_5003/master/8333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ee6d5ff95aae12f7976dbf6f1db19dd","title":"pump up the volume why massive sleeves are this years biggest trend","story":"Unmissable sleeves – with their ruffles, puffs and frills – are ballooning across the catwalk and the high street. And there’s no sign of the trend deflatingOversized sleeves shouldn’t be a viable trend. They come stuffed with social and logistical questions. Such as: is it possible to hug those you love while wearing a top that resembles giant arm bands? And: how can you possibly squeeze a pair of huge sleeves into the arms of your coat? (Answers: no and you can’t.) And yet the big sleevification of fashion is in full swing regardless.Last week’s Milan catwalks were full of sleeves the diameter of dinner plates. Elongated puffs of fabric covered the arms, like the trunk of a squid, at Fendi. At MaxMara, dresses came with drop-shouldered puff sleeves and bomber jackets with multilayered frills that recalled sea anemones.There were elbow-grazing accordion sleeves on black jumpsuits and giant batwings on beige macintoshes at Bottega Veneta. At Sportmax, a shirt with pie-crust collar came with extended, pointed shoulders that ruffled down the upper arm like angel wings.There were eccentric scenes at London fashion week, where Shrimps and Regino Pyo did leg-of-mutton chic while the shadow self of Lady Diana’s wedding dress appeared on the Richard Quinn catwalk.This is not just a runway trend, however. If anything, it came from the internet and the high street first. Instagram-savvy brands such as Ganni have made puff sleeves happen for a couple of years. Zara’s puff-sleeved creations, meanwhile – such as the sell-out £60 top with bubblegum pink sleeves as buoyant as airbags, now on eBay for about £80 – owned party season. This year’s awards-season red carpets were puff-tastic, too, with Beyoncé, Sandra Oh and Florence Pugh partaking in the big sleeve-off.That brands are still banking on what might at first have looked like a flash-in-the-pan trend, for autumnwinter 2020, with their Milan fashion week incarnation in coats even negating some of the practical challenges, suggests that giant sleeves might go the distance.Elizabeth I was an epic sleeve-wearer, too, and Tudor sleeves were often “padded with horse hair to hold the shape in a very specific way,” says Butchart. In the “Ditchley” portrait, for example, Elizabeth I’s golden sleeves “scream status,” says Butchart. “Everything about that says: ‘I’m the most important woman in the country.’”Outerwear issues aside, Mair believes they can be inclusive and practical. Elephantine sleeves make insecurities about biceps and triceps irrelevant, and can create an exaggerated hourglass silhouette because proportionally they “make the other aspects of the body look smaller”. While flattering, they are not about the male gaze, Butchart adds, because they do not present “obvious sexual signifiers”.Even more thriftily, says Mair, adding a ruffle, or a puff, at the sleeve, can also be a way of adapting an existing garment: “a good way of using resources and making them very current”. The Colville presentation at Milan fashion week proved this point: the label showed puffy sleeves, like a bolero’s, upcycled from vintage 80s shell suits and yellow puffa jackets from the 90s. The sleeves, says the Colville co-founder Lucinda Chambers, “create a new silhouette that is cool and inidual” and could be layered over other pieces.Wearing a big sleeve, says Mair, also signifies your allegiance to a tribe. “Everybody wants to belong – and most people who are interested in fashion want to be fashionable. There are so many variations that you can stand out as well as belong, which is what fashion always wants us to do,” she says.Certainly, the big sleeve is a statement – and not one that everyone will want to make. But it is big – and it’s getting bigger. This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Top tips for the perfect pancake recipeWith hot cross buns already staling on shelves, and mince pies surely mere months away, plum pudding and pancakes are the only two foods I can think of that unite the nation for but one day a year. While more delicate sorts claim to find Christmas pud too “heavy”, I’ve yet to meet anyone, regardless of religious affiliation, who eschews a Shrove Tuesday treat. Why we don’t dare to bust them out at Easter too, or on fine September mornings, is a mystery to me. Pancakes are a remarkably versatile foodstuff: French crêpes, Indian dosas, even Ethiopian injera, all fall under the same delightful banner. As Ken Albala, author of a gloriously comprehensive “global history” of the things explains, “any starchy batter … cooked in a small amount of fat on a flat surface” counts. But in Britain, as any schoolchild knows, modern pancakes are descended from those specifically designed to use up fat before the beginning of Lent, which means they tend to be heavier on the eggs and butter than, say, the fluffy American stack, or the squat Russian blini.Interestingly, the oldest recipe for pancakes as we know them comes from an English cookery book – the Good Huswifes Handmaide for the Kitchen (1594 edition) – but it’s even richer than the modern incarnation: a pint of “thicke Creame”, 5 egg yolks, “a good handful of flower” and 2 or 3 tablespoons of ale, seasoned with copious amounts of sugar, cinnamon and ginger.Albala assures me that “the result is a horrible mess” with these proportions (“one can only imagine the author was either careless or had gargantuan hands”), but once I’ve added enough flour to make it into a more workable consistency, I manage to create a pancake, of sorts, from the mixture. It’s so meltingly rich it’s all but impossible to flip, which is clearly no good at all: tasty, but more of a chaser to some roasted peacock and a goblet of sack than one for the modern kitchen.The 17th century ushered in more sober tastes – Gervase Markham’s 1615 recipe uses two eggs, a “pretty quantity of faire running water,” cloves, mace, cinnamon and nutmeg, all beaten together, “which done make thicke as you think food with fine wheate flower”. (No one can accuse these old-school food writers of being prescriptive.) Spice aside, they’re pretty dull things rubbery and heavy. Cream may be taking things too far, but milk is a must. food writer Xanthe Clay uses melted butter in her batter to compensate for any loss of flavour occasioned by cooking them in vegetable oil. BBC Good Food, meanwhile, adds a tot of vegetable oil. The first gives a better tasting pancake, but because I quite like the nutty flavour of browned butter, and the slight crispness of a plainer batter (all the better a foil for crunchy sugar and lemon juice) I decide to include neither. I do take one tip from Xanthe however, using an extra yolk to give the pancakes a depth of flavour without that slight toughness that egg white imparts.Resting batter, like soaking rice, or washing mushrooms, is one of those ideas which I’ve always lazily chosen to ignore – after all, what kind of busy thrusting sort of executive has the time to make their pancake mix half an hour before they plan to eat? Gordon Ramsay says there’s “no need”, Nigel Slater and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall disagree: and suddenly the idea seems almost attractive (even if Nigel does insist on calling them crêpes).I make up two batches of batter and allow one to sit for 30 minutes while I make and devour the other. The first lot aren’t a disaster, but the second are distinctly more even in texture – Hugh suggests this is because the starch has had more time to absorb the liquid, and air bubbles to disperse.Although Hugh and Good Food magazine counsel cooking the pancakes over a moderate heat, I prefer to follow Professor Peter Barham, physicist and adviser to Heston Blumenthal, in getting the pan really hot, because I like mine thin and crisp – you can turn it down before cooking if you prefer a softer finish. Spread the batter as thin as possible for delicately lacy edges – and treat the first pancake as an experiment it usually goes wrong, which is a good excuse to treat it as a cook’s perk. As Nigel so wisely observes, “you could argue that the perfect crêpe is always the first of the batch … Wolfed hot and hissing from the pan, squirted with lemon and a thick layer of sugar - this is the pancake that pleases the mouth if not the eye.”Perk aside, these are also good wrapped around a creamy seafood filling, stuffed with spinach and ricotta and gratinated – or, if you must, slathered with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. I’ve even heard it whispered that the sky won’t fall in if you make them this evening, as well as next Tuesday …Makes about 8125g plain flourPinch of salt1 egg plus 1 egg yolk225ml whole or semi-skimmed milk Small knob of butter1. Sift the flour in a large mixing bowl and add a pinch of salt. Make a well in the centre, and pour the egg and the yolk into it. Mix the milk with 2 tbsp water and then pour a little in with the egg and beat together.2. Whisk the flour into the liquid ingredients, drawing it gradually into the middle until you have a smooth paste the consistency of double cream. Whisk the rest of the milk in until the batter is more like single cream. Cover and refrigerate for at least half an hour.3. Heat the butter in a frying pan on a medium-high heat – you only need enough fat to just grease the bottom of the pan. It should be hot enough that the batter sizzles when it hits it.4. Spread a small ladleful of batter across the bottom of the pan, quickly swirling to coat. Tip any excess away. When it begins to set, loosen the edges with a thin spatula or palette knife, and when it begins to colour on the bottom, flip it over with the same instrument and cook for another 30 seconds. (If you’re feeling cocky, you can also toss the pancake after loosening it: grasp the handle firmly with both hands, then jerk the pan up and slightly towards you.)5. Pancakes are best eaten as soon as possible, before they go rubbery, but if you’re cooking for a crowd, keep them separate until you’re ready to serve by layering them up between pieces of kitchen roll.Why don’t we eat more pancakes in this country – and which recipes are good enough to change our minds?

Email feast@theI can cook all kinds of meat except leg of pork. It always turns out so dry, I’ve now given up even trying.Graham, Lawshall, SuffolkDon’t be so hard on yourself, Graham. Leg of pork is one of the trickier cuts, a fact acknowledged way back when British cuisine wasn’t exactly renowned for being much cop. In her 1954 classic Food in England, Dorothy Hartley goes so far as to recommend not roasting it in an oven at all, but in front of the fire. Clearly, that’s not very practical for most households these days, but Hartley adds that if you do have to use the oven, “wrap the thin end with a thick cabbage leaf or something to slow up its cooking, otherwise it will be dried away to nothing before the thick end … is thoroughly cooked through”.Contemporary cooks find pork leg no less hard work. “It’s quite a complex cut,” says James Ferguson, chefco-patron of The Kinneuchar Inn in Kilchonquhar, Fife. “Unlike other pork, it doesn’t have much connective tissue or covering fat, which is why it often ends up dry.” In other words, this stuff is infuriatingly easy to overcook. It’s worth bearing in mind, however, that leg from a native breed such as a middle white or tamworth pig has a lot more fat, though that does come at a price – it’ll set you back as much as £25 a kilo, compared with about £4 for meat of dubious provenance or £10 for free-range from the supermarket, but as with anything in life, you gets what you pays for.If roasting is more your bag, however, there are a few tricks to minimise pork leg’s vexing ways, says Sally Abé, head chef at The Harwood Arms in west London, which was voted Britain’s best at last month’s Top 50 Gastropub awards. “Always make sure you cook it from room temperature, rather than fridge-cold, because it will cook more evenly that way,” she says. Resting, too, is crucial, so the meat relaxes and the juices get a chance to redistribute themselves throughout the whole joint.Another option is to bone the leg, which makes it far easier to control. “Ask your butcher to roll it with the scored skin on the outside,” says Ferguson, who after just five months in business took home the gastropub gong at the National Food \u0026amp Drink Awards earlier this month (you’ve got to laugh, Ferguson says: he and his partner moved to Fife expressly because they were “tired of working in kitchens where chefs were driven by awards and stars”). “And leave it uncovered in the fridge overnight, to dry the skin,” he says. That will make for much better crackling, as will a good sprinkle of sea salt a good few hours ahead of time, Abé adds – do that while you’re waiting for the meat to come up to room temperature, .• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

As a proud son of Catalonia the Manchester City manager is a supporter of the region’s independence movement, which has put him at odds with the Castilians of Real.As a Barcelona player and then manager Guardiola fought numerous battles with Real, and his numbers in the latter capacity have come into focus as he prepares to lead City at the Bernabéu in the Champions League last‑16 first leg on Wednesday night.In four seasons in charge at Barcelona, Guardiola played seven times in all competitions at Real’s stadium, winning five, drawing two and losing none.It felt as though he had an Indian sign over them as he marched to three La Liga titles and two more in the Champions League. Under normal circumstances, Pep versus Real would fill the pre-match preview.It is also Guardiola versus the Champions League, the competition that he looked set to dominate when he won it twice in his first three seasons at Barcelona – which was, of course, his first job in management. It has not worked out that way.When Guardiola arrived at City in 2016 he came with something of a semi-final curse. In five of his seven seasons at Barcelona and then Bayern Munich, he fell in the Champions League’s last four. His first stab at the competition with Bayern ended with a 5-0 aggregate defeat by Real, which featured his only career defeat as a manager at the Bernabéu.At City he has not even made it that far. A part of the reason for the club’s hiring of him was to try to win Europe’s elite trophy for the first time but one last-16 exit followed by a pair of quarter-final reverses has added up to a blot on his record.Guardiola’s critics say his legacy at City will be tarnished if he fails to win the Champions League, which is an awfully harsh way to look at things, particularly as he eyes the Carabao Cup final against Aston Villa on Sunday. Win that and he would have carried off seven of the past eight domestic trophies, including Community Shields.It also overlooks the beauty of the footballing culture he has instilled at City, how the club’s fans have been treated and entertained as rarely before. It is difficult to put a price on the memories Guardiola has created how so many of his matches at City have come to resemble inidual pieces of the highest theatre, taking people to different planes.Yet Pep and the Champions League obsession has nonetheless become a thing, a talking point, a strong line of narrative. And again, under normal circumstances, it would fill the pre‑match preview.These are not normal circumstances. What happened on the Friday before last in the adjudicatory chamber of Uefa’s club financial and control body (CFCB) saw to that. City’s two‑year ban from European football for deceitful submissions with regard to financial fair play has changed everything, placing asterisks against their titles from 2012-16 – the period under scrutiny – and, on a more micro level, squeezing the dynamics of the showpiece with Real.The club’s appeal to the court of arbitration for sport will provide a sideshow over the coming months and it could yet delay the punishment, which is scheduled to kick in next season, or even overturn it.But for now Guardiola must assume that this season will be his last shot at the Champions League with City for some time or possibly ever – given he will be five years in the job at the end of next season when his contract expires. Guardiola has not previously entered a fifth season as the manager of a club, let alone a sixth or seventh.It is no great leap to see the situation as now or never, or that a siege mentality has built at City and for Guardiola, where the CFCB has become the latest and most dastardly external enemy, following on from referees and VAR, the fixture schedulers and even the media. Guardiola does not enjoy having to give press conferences or flash interviews and, sometimes this season, he has been haughty to the point of petulant in them.City have adopted the language of the siege – witness their incendiary statements towards the CFCB, in which they have variously derided its processes as “curtailed, hostile, prejudicial, flawed and consistently leaked”. Ferran Soriano, the chief executive, has said, “This seems to be less about justice and more about politics.” Guardiola, too, despite being much more diplomatic, has got across the sense of persecution. He said last Friday that no one had helped City this season and he was reported to have told his players he would honour his contract “even if they put us in League Two”. The club have not disputed this comment.City’s financial irregularities are not down to Guardiola, the players or, indeed, the fans, some of whom are in vociferously defiant mood. There are supporters who feel that the club might have broken the rules and they are ready to accept the consequences. It is just that these fans are mostly not on social media.The apocalyptic scenario, which does not feel so far away, is that without Champions League income, City will be unable to service their wage bill, which is the third highest in football. If all or part of the ban sticks, players may have to be sold and Raheem Sterling was not slow to give an interview to AS last week in which he talked admiringly of Real Madrid. It recalled the one that Gareth Bale, then of Tottenham, gave to the same Spanish publication in 2011 before his team’s Champions League quarter‑final first leg at the Bernabéu. Bale got his move to Real in 2013.For now, City have an enticing 90 minutes ahead of them and, in their eyes, it is them against Real and the world. Can Guardiola harness the collective sense of injustice to fire a run to glory? The stakes could not be higher."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ededf481b897d43de1220fcc8b125bf130885116/0_200_4572_2744/master/4572.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6156e11eae828ff9b8cf3861a54620c","title":"chelsea v bayern munich champions league last 16 live","story":"Pennant watch.

And yet they did it. That bald fact should give Frank Lampard’s team much-needed succour as they go into battle tonight ... and they may need it, because once again Bayern are considered the more likely, for various reasons. Consider: Chelsea haven’t won any of their last eight knockout ties in this competition they’ve only tasted Champions League victory at Stamford Bridge once in their last six Bayern won all six of their group matches this season to an aggregate score of 24-5 Robert Lewandowski is this season’s leading Champions League scorer with ten and the last time in-form Bayern came to town, they whistled seven goals past Spurs. Gulp! (x5)But here’s more hope for Chelsea: they don’t half enjoy playing teams from Germany.  They beat Stuttgart in the 1998 Cup Winners’ Cup final, knocked the same team out in the 2004 Champions League round of 16, saw off Eintracht Frankfurt in the semis of last year’s Europa League, put Bayern out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage in 2005, and of course there’s that aforementioned final in 2012. Their only defeat against German opposition in winner-takes-all competition was a defeat on penalties in the 2013 Super Cup. Bayern will have reasons of their own to be extremely wary.They were also, let us not forget, knocked out at this stage last year by an English team. So can Chelsea do what Liverpool did 12 months ago? Or will Bayern continue on their quest to reach a first final in seven years? After tonight’s action, we’ll be halfway to finding out the answers.

And there’s very little to be gained from examining the managers’ Champions League pedigree, because they don’t have one: for both of them this is their debut in the competition. “It’s exciting for me to start this Champions League journey in a stadium like this with so much passion and history,” trilled Quique Setien. “There’s no better place to start.”As for Napoli’s Gennaro Gattuso, he did play six times against Barcelona in the Champions League as a player, but there’s not much to be gleaned there either: he won two, drew two and lost two. “When I played against Barca it seemed that they were from another category because they didn’t let you see the ball,” he says. “We know therefore that we will face an opponent of a stratospheric level, and we know that the risks are big, but having said that I don’t want my players to be afraid.

It has remained relatively unchanged with a score in the mid-30s since the early 1990s.Some economists question the usefulness of the Gini coefficient, warning that it can mask nuances in income and wealth isions.

Here’s how they can help you relate to your partnerPerhaps your partner is a gift-giver who often spots things they think you would love, from a funny-shaped leaf to a rare first edition, but is hurt when you don’t seem that grateful. Maybe you painstakingly undertake DIY around the house, but it goes unnoticed. There is a strong possibility that you and your partner see these acts completely differently.According to the Five Love Languages, written by Gary Chapman, a Christian pastor and relationships counsellor, we each have a “language” in the way we express and would like to receive love and affection. The book was first published in 1992 and the relationship therapists I speak to still use its ideas.“Talking about love languages is a really good way for people to talk about how they need to be loved,” says Simone Bose, a relationship therapist and spokeswoman for Relate. “I find that when there is conflict with couples, or they feel the intimacy is not there – they might say: ‘You don’t show me love’ or ‘You don’t show me appreciation’ – and that’s a good time to bring this into the conversation. How do you like to feel appreciated? How do you like to feel loved? Because appreciation and love can feel quite similar when you’re in a long-term relationship. How do you feel seen?”According to Chapman, there are five basic love languages: words of affirmation (such as saying to your partner “I love you”, or paying them compliments) quality time (phones away, television off, unided attention) receiving gifts acts of service (such as making a nightly hot-water bottle, or taking on the household jobs you know your partner dislikes) and physical touch. Chapman believes we have a “primary” love language (there is a questionnaire on his website), and he notes that, in his experience, couples seldom share the same one.Moyle says this idea can be helpful. “I think it’s a clever concept because it’s so simple and so relatable,” she says. “Understanding your primary love language and your partner’s can break through that communication barrier – and we know the communication barrier is the biggest, most common issue in any relationship in terms of misunderstanding.”The framework, writes Chapman, can also improve and illuminate all kinds of relationships, such as those with our parents, children and friends, if we work out what their love languages are.Moyle says she recommends that most of the couples she works with look at the idea of love languages. “We’re all inidual, all have our own backgrounds, our own stories, so it’s understandable that we’re not all going to show love in the same way. It can really help couples to move through an impasse if they are feeling misunderstood, or if they feel they are trying really hard, but not getting anywhere. It’s a tool for helping us to understand each other better.”One person might feel they are showing their partner love in the best way they know how – they are the ones who change the bed linen, or plan the holidays, or make time to listen – but the other person might not appreciate it, or even notice. “That’s when this conversation is really good because you find out that they would prefer to be told – they will say: ‘You never tell me that you love me,’” says Bose. It could be as simple as telling your partner what is most meaningful to you, though this isn’t always easy. “I find that people feel quite vulnerable about saying these things – they don’t want to appear needy.”It may be difficult for a partner to provide more of what the other would like in some cases, it might mean having to rewrite everything they think they know about affection – lessons from observing their parents’ relationship, the love they were shown in childhood, the norms of their culture, and what they have picked up from books or films.Chapman acknowledges that physical touch may be particularly awkward for someone who is not naturally tactile. He recommends starting small: “Begin with small things such as putting your hand on her shoulder as you pour a cup of coffee,” he writes. If giving “words of affirmation” feels unnatural, he advises making “a list of statements you hear from other people or that you read or hear in the media” and practising saying them in front of a mirror.Although it might sound a little clinical, Bose says: “A lot of the time, it’s about building new habits. Be more conscientious of your actions when you’re around your partner, get better at reading them if they look like they could do with a hug or kind words.” And be mindful of how your partner may be showing you love. Maybe they like buying gifts, even if you’d rather they didn’t. “Allow them that space to express themselves without dismissing it.”Bose finds that, although it was a good way to get people talking in counselling sessions, many people wouldn’t find they had a “primary” love language, but were fairly split across them all. This has been one of the criticisms of the idea. (I tried to find my own love language and decided all of them would do nicely, but perhaps I’m just greedy.)Any couples counsellor will tell you communication is key to a healthy relationship, and even the most sceptical would agree that exploring the love languages can spark a deeper conversation. In day-to-day life, trying out the theory needn’t require a huge amount of time, effort or expense – even those who love to receive gifts appreciate the thoughtfulness, rather than the money spent.Prioritise and create quality time with your partner and be aware of physical touch (not sex, necessarily for a partner whose primary love language is touch, Chapman recommends sitting close to them while watching TV, or a brief touch as you walk through the room). “It can be something simple like taking the bins out or putting everything away,” says Moyle.“It’s not necessarily huge statements. A lot of the time it’s about the little things. Saying thank you, showing someone you appreciate them. We are busy and often preoccupied, so these are things that tend to fall out of sight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0af2bc61f6b4703bd38c28ed764b612ba0b86097/0_26_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=688c2f8b9dacfe5297f6b38830816d03","title":"oh heck when politicians become unwanted brand ambassadors","story":"Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are just the latest politicians to cause serious embarrassment with their unsolicited supportIf the perplexed social media team at Yorkshire Tea who spent much of their weekend responding to criticism that they make “Tory tea” after the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, posed making a cup, they can look for sympathy to their fellow brand managers – who have often been caught in the maelstrom of an unwelcome political endorsement.The most common controversies are those involving musicians, who are often allergic to the idea that a politician they detest might use their songs. REM’s bassist, Mike Mills, tweeted earlier this year that the band were exploring legal action to prevent the US president, Donald Trump, from using their music at his rallies and calling him a fraud and a conman.Johnny Marr went further – and, after hearing that David Cameron was a fan, tweeted to the then PM that he was forbidden to like The Smiths any more.But it’s not just artists who have to deal with the fallout of a political endorsement. This time last year, the newly formed Independent Group for Change had a launch lunch in Nando’s. A photo of the group’s first outing was tweeted by Chuka Umunna to much furore on Twitter, and enthusiastic criticism of the politicians’ food choices.Gavin Shuker, who was the MP for Luton South from 2010 to 2019, also tweeted about the meal out, writing: “Hacks struggling for an angle on how best to report the kremlinology of the group be aware I kept a list of medium, lemon and herb, extra hot and my DMs are open.”Matt Navarra, a social media industry commentator, said there are people who make careers from being hated and offering polarising views.“For brands you have to be careful around things like, would it be seen to be leveraging a situation that is quite serious and maybe has negative implications, is that a good thing? Also being aware about the level of audiences for that person and what responding or engaging may lead to,” he said.Navarra added that engaging with someone who has quite aggressive followers could lead to a “a headache as they may bring an army of trolls with them”.For politicians, using brands can be a good strategy as it feels more familiar and colloquial, Navarra said. He flags the case of Labour and KFC, when the Conservatives tweeted the chicken brand saying: “Hey @KFC_UKI, we’ve found an even bigger chicken than you,” attaching an image of Corbyn in a chicken suit to KFC. The food brand, however, was not having any of it, with a quick retort.“KFC came off better than politicians but for them it also brought them into the centre for people’s minds around that topic,” Navarra said.The phenomenon with politicians can also happen in reverse – when a brand thinks they’ve done a great bit of advertising, then realise it may have backfired badly. That happened to Heck Sausages during the 2019 Conservative leadership election campaign, when it must have seemed like a publicity coup to have the potential future prime minister visit its sausage factory en route to leadership hustings in York.As well as the usual pictures on the factory floor, Heck had produced some specially branded “Boris bangers” in a packet complete with branding and a distinctive shock of blond hair. The backlash was immediate. #BoycottHeck began trending on social media and the company was enveloped in a full-blown PR crisis – ultimately issuing a statement to clarify that the company had no political affiliation “and didn’t mean to cause offence or upset anyone”. If only the chancellor had been around to offer them a soothing brew."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/724fd725c6ed91529b3d8e11923f373f0bce3679/0_46_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d159f04e4b4acff55636fae313ced4cd","title":"lise davidsen soprano fidelio royal opera house london","story":"Hailed as one of the greatest voices of her generation, the Norwegian soprano is taking on Beethoven’s freedom-loving heroine at Covent Garden. She talks about family, friends and facing her fearsI’m pretty sure the man who’s very politely shunting Lise Davidsen out of our Royal Opera House interview room to make way for an audit meeting doesn’t recognise her, but perhaps that’s not so surprising. Davidsen is simultaneously one of the company’s biggest draws this season and a relatively new face on the international stage. It may be that the casting of Jonas Kaufmann as Florestan ensured the ROH’s new production of Fidelio, staged by Tobias Kratzer, sold out within 24 hours, but for many it’s the prospect of Davidsen as Leonore – Beethoven’s courageous, cross-dressing, husband-rescuing heroine – that’s generating the real excitement.Davidsen was virtually unknown in 2015 when she swept the board at Operalia, the competition that has helped launch the careers of Nina Stemme, Sonya Yoncheva and many others. Her performance in the final was a sensation: here was a fully fledged, radiant voice big enough to soar over a Wagnerian orchestra, coming out of the mouth of a singer aged only 28. Yet while her voice and her height – she is nearly 6 foot 2 – might have led some to imagine her as the Valkyrie incarnate, she has chosen her roles more wisely than that, saving Brünnhilde and Isolde and the other big, potentially voice-destroying roles for later, and instead choosing either supporting roles in big houses or leading roles in small ones. Her UK stage debut, as Strauss’s Ariadne at Glyndebourne in 2017, was, according to the Times’s Neil Fisher, “one of those ‘I was there’ moments” in the Observer, Fiona Maddocks wrote that hers was “one of the greatest voices I have heard”. Leonore will be her first starring role in London.In interview, Davidsen is unassuming, direct and straightforward: not so different, you imagine, from the handball-playing girl she was in the small town of Stokke in rural Norway. She started singing with any seriousness only when she was 15, went to music college in Bergen, and was all set for a career in baroque music as a mezzo-soprano when, as a postgraduate in Copenhagen, her teacher spotted her potential as an operatic soprano. “I knew I had those high notes, but they were there in a very childish, undeveloped way. I thought, OK, I’ll have to work for this, I’ll put in whatever it takes.”Success followed rapidly, but her new lifestyle took some getting used to. “My brother and sister have normal jobs and families, and I thought I was going to do that too – to live in one place and just sing. I really wanted what I do now, but it took me time to get here, to include myself in it, in a way.” Last year saw the release of her first solo disc, a garlanded debut at the Met in New York and her first role at Bayreuth, the hallowed festival that takes place in Wagner’s own opera house. It was, she says, “the first year where I actually enjoyed some of it, some of the circus. Until then I had been so afraid. Everything had been so new: the constant travelling, never being at home, but trying to find a way to be a normal person, to still be with friends and family.”The fact that she’s now returning to places rather than going from debut to debut makes things a little easier, she says, and she has learned to trust the people she works with. Before, she felt uncomfortable accepting engagements years in advance – what if her voice changed and she had to let people down? “My agent told me, ‘say yes to what you think you will do, and everyone will understand that life and the voice will develop. It’s a two-way communication.’ Now I trust that communication much more. I trust that a conductor is there to actually help me. The pressure from the audience gets higher and higher, but you feel more comfortable with the people you work with. I’m now starting to see how this will be my life.”This morning they have been rehearsing Kratzer’s staging of the overture, in which the shadow of the guillotine looms large – Beethoven’s only opera is highly political, with liberté, égalité, fraternité themes, and a heroine whose music expresses her fears as vividly as her resolve. Leonore is quite a different role to Davidsen’s Wagnerian heroines, who have integrity and depth but little agency. “She’s so unselfish, which I like, so determined. So many female roles have this compassion, this determination for love, but in terms of actions it’s quite different. It’s nice to play a really good woman!”Kratzer’s Bayreuth production of Tannhäuser, which began with Venus (on screen) in a Citroën driving her entourage to Burger King, was provocative but mostly enthusiastically received. Not that Davidsen read the reviews. ‘I don’t believe reviews are written for me, nor do I believe they’re giving me anything. I know exactly when I leave the stage what I did right and what I did wrong. No matter what’s written, I’ll have to go back on stage in a couple of days anyway, and I want to make sure that performance number two, three, four is just as important as number one.”After Leonore she will be going back into the recording studio for her second solo disc – the repertoire is still under wraps – and then back to Bayreuth for more Wagner: Elisabeth in Tannhaüser again, and Sieglinde in the Ring. The next few years are set to bring more Strauss and some Verdi – Don Carlo, La forza del destino and Un ballo in maschera. But one date that is always in her diary is the next concert back in Stokke, where she has a loyal following. “They support me in this unconditional way,” she says. “I love it! It’s like a team.” Twenty-five of them, she says, came over to New York to see her debut there. Will they be in the audience for Fidelio too? “No, it sold out too quickly! But they will watch it at the cinema in Sandefjord.”A few days after we speak, Davidsen is on stage at the Barbican, giving a recital with the pianist James Baillieu, in which she speaks several times to the audience about what she’s going to sing. She doesn’t yet own the stage, but she looks as though she knows she’s among friends, and the audience loves her for it. “It’s a huge irony that I’m an opera singer because I could never see myself on stage. I was so insecure.” Previously she’s talked about having something resembling impostor syndrome – “but I do now feel I have a reason to be there. In many ways I’m still a private person, but the stage has become this space of mine where I can be someone else or tell a story or communicate something. What I was so afraid of has become my safe space – it’s interesting how it turned out to be the complete opposite of what I feared.”• Fidelio opens at the Royal Opera House, London, on 1 March. The 17 March performance will be shown live in cinemas in Europe and the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ec7cc543fa803cde416b586ac039cf9eead6a4/0_57_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=754ec7244d9f5063ed8030bd5cf53d6f","title":"manchester city following the money","story":"Manchester City’s fortunes changed dramatically with the takeover by Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi.

Johnson’s chief negotiator, David Frost, has also in recent days spoken of the importance of the UK as a “sovereign equal” being untied from EU standards under a free trade deal.Barnier said the EU was not seeking to retain any hold over the UK but that the prime minister had already committed to maintaining EU standards “less than six months ago”.“Mr Johnson’s spokesman said the main objective of the UK in these negotiations is to ensure that we obtain the economic and political independence of the United Kingdom on 1 January this year, but, no, that is not true,” Barnier said. “The economic and political independence of the UK doesn’t need to be negotiated on its been done, it’s been achieved, that’s what Brexit has achieved. It was the will of the UK and they’ve left.“Nobody’s going to discuss the sovereignty, the independence or the autonomy of the UK that’s not the purpose of these negotiations. I was very surprised to read this, supposedly something that was said by a spokesman from Downing Street.”Barnier said the task was to put into legal text the commitments made by both sides in a 26-page political declaration on the future relationship, including the “robust” provisions to ensure Britain did not undercut the EU rulebook on workers’ and environmental standards and subsidies.With reference to the prime minister’s refusal to extend the transition period beyond 2020, Barnier added: “If we want to succeed in the very short period of time that Mr Johnson has chosen we need to make sure we don’t start backtracking.”Under the EU’s vision of the future relationship, both sides will commit to not reduce their current standards. Brussels would retain the right to apply tariffs on the UK if there were “disruptions of the equal condition of competition” as EU law develops and the UK fails to follow that “reference point”. On state aid rules, the UK would need to “dynamically align” with EU law.The UK will publish its vision of the future deal on Thursday but the government has said it will reject any deal that involves alignment on policy or Britain remaining under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. The UK is insisting that a Canada-style trade deal, with looser provisions on ensuring a competitive level playing field, is the most appropriate option. Barnier said the levels of trade with the UK were 10 times bigger than Canada. “At the same time Canada is some 5,000km away. It is clear that the rules cannot be the same.”Earlier in the day, the  had revealed that the EU is also demanding the UK maintains a ban on chlorinated chicken as the price for a trade agreement with Brussels, in a move that protects European meat exports and creates an obstacle to a deal with Donald Trump.On the recommendation of France, a clause has been inserted into the EU’s negotiating mandate to insist that both sides maintain “health and product sanitary quality in the food and agriculture sector”, according to a copy leaked to the .At the weekend, George Eustice, the UK environment secretary, refused to  guarantee that the government would not allow the importation of chlorine-washed chicken as part of a trade deal with the US.The EU’s position was backed by the National Farmers’ Union on Tuesday whose president, Minette Batters, said it would be “morally bankrupt” and “insane” of Johnson to drop the UK’s high farming and food standards in order to strike a US deal.She raised concerns that Johnson had dismissed misgivings over US animal welfare and food standards as “hysteria” and “mumbo jumbo” in a keynote speech in Greenwich three weeks ago.“To sign up to a trade deal which results in opening our ports, shelves and fridges to food which would be illegal to produce here would not only be morally bankrupt. It would be the work of the insane.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e907601783ca8fe6b2df34390d0823c660959b1d/129_0_691_415/master/691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f4d0f5532db7087df4068c1674bac94","title":"tory mp james grundy apologises after exposing himself in pub","story":"James Grundy, MP for Leigh, dropped his trousers at private event in 2007A Conservative MP has apologised after he was filmed flashing his genitals in a pub.James Grundy dropped his trousers at a private event in the bar, with onlookers encouraging him to expose himself. The incident took place more than a decade before Grundy was elected as MP for Leigh, Greater Manchester, in 2019.He said: “I apologise for my actions and for any offence caused.”Footage obtained by LBC shows Grundy taking down his trousers and a woman can be heard asking him to lift his shirt to show his genitals. In the video, he asks for assurance that his face can’t be seen: “We’re OK, aren’t we? There’s no way you can get my face in?”All those involved in the event, which took place in 2007, are understood to have been over the age of 18 at the time.LBC reported that the incident took place in the Rams Head Inn in Lowton, in what is now Grundy’s constituency.Grundy, 41, became a councillor in 2008 before being elected as an MP in 2019, becoming the first Tory to represent Leigh.“I’ll be honest, it’s fair to say I never expected to win, and it’s fair to say nobody else did either,” he said, adding that he wrote his victory speech “in 30 seconds” just before the result was announced.Jo Platt, the Labour candidate he defeated, said: “Is it wrong for me to feel sorry for him?

Lawyers? Nurses? Doctors? Just because ‘he got his bits out for the lads’ doesn’t make him a bad person, and now he’s apologised, what for? Being a human enjoying a night out. He wasn’t to know he was going to be in the public eye years down the line did he?”Grundy lives on the family farm in Lowton with his parents and sister, where they keep horses.Before becoming an MP in December he said he had only been to London three times and needed help navigating the capital on his arrival."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e3e9d91b6aeb049786fcd9981d21f3f4abc1d83/0_121_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddae453794d19c4251e4bcf681a710ce","title":"why chlorinated chicken is centre of the table in uk eu talks","story":"Battle over food standards is a symbol of broader conflicts between the US and EuropeChlorinated chicken has become totemic once again in talks between the UK and the EU about their post-Brexit relationship, thanks to the EU inserting a new clause into its negotiating mandate. The clause will require the UK to maintain a ban on poultry treated with disinfectant if it wants a trade deal with its nearest neighbours.The US allows its industrial meat producers to wash their birds in chlorine or other disinfecting acid solutions after slaughter to kill the food-poisoning bugs they often carry, having been contaminated by chicken faeces during processing. Persuading British negotiators to drop the ban and accept US food standards is a high priority for the US in a trade deal with the UK.The battle is about much more than chlorinated, or more accurately chlorine-washed chicken. This particular US agricultural export keeps rearing its head because it encapsulates much wider arguments about the future of trade between the different power blocs.Since most British consumers associate chlorine with the bleach they pour down their lavatories, the Americans know they have lost the PR war on that particular chemical treatment, and are now promoting the line that their farmers don’t use chlorine much any more, but favour other disinfectants such as lactic acid and peracetic acid.The US is the world’s largest producer of poultry meat, and nearly one fifth of what it produces is exported. Its lower welfare standards enable it to achieve some of the cheapest production in the world. For Americans one of the chief prizes of Brexit is the opportunity to break open a major European economy to its huge surplus in agricultural goods. It has experienced years of failed trade talks with Europe in which the EU has refused to weaken its food and farming standards to bring them in line with US ones, whether on genetic modification or gene-editing, growth-promoting hormones in beef and pig production, a series of pesticides, antibiotics and other veterinary drugs, and on labelling.The EU takes a fundamentally different view on food safety to the US. It applies the precautionary principle, banning substances and processes that are potentially harmful to humans and nature until they are proved safe. The US tends to approve chemicals until they are proven harmful and allows its producers to clean up at the end of the chain. It sees the EU objections to its goods as fundamentally protectionist. Conservative Brexiters see European objections to US standards in the same light. They have argued that once free from burdensome EU regulations, British consumers will benefit from much cheaper food. For them the biggest prize in return is greater access to US markets for UK financial services.The British poultry industry is worth £7.2bn a year. Like the US industry, it suffers from persistent problems with contamination. (The US has more E coli and salmonella, the UK more campylobacter in both countries poultry is one of the main cause of food poisoning.)British farmers know that if US imports of cheap meat produced to different hygiene and welfare standards are allowed, they will be fatally undercut. The European industry fears the same. For Boris Johnson, who happily played the cuddly animal card with his new dog, Dilyn, during the election, ignoring British consumer attitudes to welfare will be difficult, especially with the EU making clear the UK cannot have it both ways."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f40d1c5e33e3582bfe0389901229b76725765cae/412_425_6075_3645/master/6075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62868494d7324197568b19f546d04d72","title":"brexit eu mandate trade talks ministers meet to agree negotiating mandate for trade talks with uk live news","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including the EU agreeing its negotiating mandate for the post-Brexit trade talks with the UK, and the ’s Labour leadership hustings in ManchesterQ: Would you back PR?Starmer says he is open to PR.

Labour should be getting rid of Tory MPs, not Labour ones.

They’re too busy analysing their data – which they’ll share with you at every opportunity. Speed, distance, altitude, vertical drop, crystals captured … friends of the tech hound may want to take their own noise-cancelling headphones on holiday.The tech hound laughs in the face of unplugging for a digital-free ski break. They have a camera in their helmet, an augmented reality version of the slopes playing in their goggles and smart boots fitted with a wearable device to deliver real-time audio ski coaching tips via an app. They’d be filming it all on their drone if the devices weren’t banned from most ski resorts.Tips for tech hounds: Check in with your resort to see what tech is on offer before you arrive. For instance, Club Med has introduced digital RFID bracelets, which provide room access and easy payment around the resort property. Perfect for the techy on the slopes.For the show-off, the mountain is a mere background wallpaper in the story of their life, the gondola is a place to do their makeup, and their skis purely a means of transport to push from one epic selfie spot to another. Of which there are so many all around.The show-off works best on bluebird days and hides in the hotel during photographically challenging blizzards or whiteouts. They used to hang out at the snow park taking selfies at the top of the half pipe until someone pushed them off the lip one day. They got stuck in the centre and had to be pulled out by mountain rescue on a skidoo. Still, it made a good Instagram story.Tips for show-offs: Keep your phone in an inside jacket pocket as close to your body as possible, as cold temperatures will make your battery run out more quickly.Resort pick: Club Med Val Thorens is the perfect base to tick off the 3 Vallées selfie spot trail.“How hard can it be?” thought the first-timer. They’d seen Ski Sunday and watched a couple of YouTube tutorials on the flight over. The first-timer was used to success, unaccustomed to failure, which might explain why they asked for expert skis at the hire shop. And then proceeded to almost twist a knee when their binding didn’t release during a pile-up, which they themselves had caused by skiing into a group getting off the chairlift.At least it saved them from taking on the icy black run they were about to attempt, though. The lifties bundled the first-timer back down the way they came, to the safety of the green runs and covered magic carpet. And there they skied, with their bum in the air as is the form for all beginners who don’t have lessons, being overtaken by kids half their size, until the end of their holiday.Tips for first-timers: Get lessons. There’s no shame in ski school. It’s the quickest way to progress, and even advanced skiers will improve with some tailored tuition. And thanks to Club Med’s partnership with Ecole du Ski Français (ESF), customers get free lessons (available Monday to Friday).Après-ski royalty does not care about first lifts. They’re not even sure they exist, though they did hear someone mention the concept once. Just before midday is when après-ski royalty likes to head up the mountain to avoid the afternoon lift pass rush. Queues are not their scene at all.They might do a red run, a quick head-clearer, with a pace and poise that belies the little amount of time they actually spend on snow rather than in the bar. And then it’s time to settle down for lunch at a sunny outdoor deck with a cocktail or two, moving to each new après spot like clockwork with the sun as it shifts around the mountain.At three, it’s time for the VIP bar at La Folie Douce, where they’ll dance on a table draped in a sea of feather boas. Obvs. As the sun starts to set, après-ski royalty styles it down the mountain and heads home.Tips for après-ski royalty: Research happy hour slots and the best après spots in advance so you can plan your route with precision.Resort pick: Club Med Alpe d’Huez is a top resort for après-ski vibes, with one of the finest Folie Douce in the Alps.The new parents stand at the top of the chairlift scratching their heads. They’re sure they’ve forgotten something. Gloves, poles, phone, oh yes, they remember, we have a child now! But it’s OK, she’s in nursery today. Blinking into the morning sun, the dad remembers he left his goggles on the changing mat, while the mum wonders if the white on her jacket is milk, baby sick or snow.Then they push off – it feels weird at first, but they embrace their newfound freedom, skiing together in the endless white. It’s just like the old days, except this morning they have the slopes to themselves as only new parents and powder hounds are up this early.They’re exhausted by lunchtime and downing double espressos to get through the afternoon, but they return to their child with a sparkle in their eyes. They only planned to use the odd day of nursery, but they sign their beloved up for the rest of the week.Tips for new parents: All-inclusive snow trips are a great option for families with young children, thanks to their on-site nurseries, child-friendly meal provision, and day-long kids’ clubs.Resort pick: Club Med Les Arcs Panorama, where the Club Med has one of the best childcare setups in the Alps.Club Med, founded in 1950, is the pioneer of the all-inclusive concept, offering nearly 70 premium resorts in stunning locations around the world including North and South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82df378803fe493f7eb757a1bba636e14d665bd6/76_0_7344_4407/master/7344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5cf95675fe91e805c00a140700752d0","title":"share your views on gene editing","story":"We would like to find out what you think about gene editing.

According to the NHS, it is thought to be an autoimmune disease and affects one in every 420 people in the UK. Sufferers need to empty their bowels frequently, develop ulcers in their colon and have recurring bouts of diarrhoea with blood and pus in the faeces.While a number of medicines can help manage the condition, ulcerative colitis can only be cured by removing the colon. However, about half of those who have this surgery go on to have inflammation in the area of the small intestine that is reconstructed into a pouch to serve as a rectum. Such inflammation is treated with antibiotics.Now researchers say patients who have had this surgery for ulcerative colitis have lower levels of certain acids in their faeces, and fewer of the bacteria that produce them, than those who have had the surgery for other reasons.The team say the results shed light on why the latter have a far lower risk of inflammation in their pouch. They say it also offers insights into ulcerative colitis itself, with experiments in mice suggesting inflammatory bowel diseases could be treated by introducing these “missing” acids into the colon.Dr Aida Habtezion, a co-author of the study from Stanford University, told the  the findings suggest a new approach to treating ulcerative colitis could be developed, based on introducing microbes or the substances they produce. Many patients find current treatments do not work or have side-effects. “I think it brings another mechanism, a natural way, in which we can reconstitute and hopefully treat our patients,” Habtezion said.Writing in the journal Cell Host \u0026amp Microbe, the team report how they studied two groups of patients who had had their colons removed and pouches created. For one group, of 17 patients, this surgery was to treat ulcerative colitis whereas for the other group, of seven patients, it was because of a different condition that does not involve inflammation.Certain bacteria in the gut are known to convert bile acids, produced by the liver, into other substances, called secondary bile acids – these substances have recently been suggested to have an anti-inflammatory role.The team analysed faeces from patients in each group, finding that patients treated for ulcerative colitis had far lower levels of certain secondary bile acids than the other group. Their faeces contained far less evidence of bacterial genes necessary for the production of these substances.They also had less erse bacteria in their faeces that the other group, and more specifically, far lower levels of ruminococcaceae. Such bacteria are among those able to convert bile acids to secondary bile acids.Experiments in mice with three different conditions comparable to ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease – another disease where parts of the digestive system becomes inflamed – offered further insights. They found that introducing these secondary bile acids reduced markers of the disease, such as inflammation.Habtezion said the findings chime with other research that has suggested patients with inflammatory bowel disease have lower levels of secondary bile acids. However, she said it was still unclear if the shift in bacteria and depletion of secondary bile acids were a cause or an effect of such conditions. The team is carrying out a clinical study to explore whether introducing secondary bile acids may help to treat patients who have had surgery for ulcerative colitis but who develop inflammation in their pouches.Dr Gwo-tzer Ho, a consultant gastroenterologist and expert on ulcerative colitis at the University of Edinburgh, welcomed the study and the ongoing clinical trial. He said that, if successful, the approach could be particularly helpful for those who also had a condition called primary sclerosing cholangitis – a disease of the bile ducts.But he said it was important to investigate further whether a dearth of similar bacteria, and the secondary bile acids they produce, was seen in the colons of those with ulcerative colitis who had not had surgery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5719db0fb48601988056e0fa45857d149d8088c9/94_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6851ea9c1d2f8f69c19aec1ed6775b95","title":"england cricket the hundred 2030 the spin","story":"A decade after his predictions for 2020, Vic Marks looks at what might happen 10 years from now, including why Jimmy Anderson is unhappy with the vegan Duke ballsSir Andrew Strauss, chairman of the England Cricket Board, has delivered his annual report. He began by congratulating the England captain, Ollie Pope, on the team’s successful defence of the Ashes in Australia. The series finished level at 2-2 with the Sydney Test drawn. The outcome of each match was still in doubt at tea on the fifth day. The reversion to five-day Test cricket, which coincided with Colin Graves’s departure as chairman of the International Cricket Council, was deemed a success among the four countries still committed to playing Test cricket on a regular basis.Strauss expressed his gratitude to Pope and his red-ball coaching staff led by Richard Dawson, the former England off-spinner and Gloucestershire coach. He also highlighted the success of the one-day side, now overseen by Eoin Morgan, in the inaugural six-nation European Cup. England won the grand slam but he acknowledged there had been one or two well-publicised blips along the way and he thanked the minister for culture, media and sport, Edward Smith, for his assistance.When the England team arrived at the Scottish border without their passports it was only the minister’s intervention that allowed them to pass swiftly through customs and on to Edinburgh to fulfil the fixture. The ECB’s administrative staff ensured they avoided the same mistake on the way to the match against Wales in Cardiff. The Dutch side finished second in the table and, although without a victory, Italy showed signs of significant improvement. However, there was some frustration that the press facilities at their ground just outside of Siena were not big enough to accommodate a surprisingly large English media contingent.Victory in the European Cup consolidated the success of England’s second World Cup triumph in 2027 and the winning of the gold medal in the Los Angeles Olympics of 2028. Strauss also congratulated the women’s team on their silver medal in a T20 competition dominated yet again by the Australian “Invincibelles”.Strauss announced he had set up a cricket subcommittee led by Sir Moeen Ali. They have been discussing a variety of issues. One member, Jimmy Anderson, who is now England’s pace bowling consultant, has pointed out that his withdrawal from professional cricket in 2028 was hastened by the new vegan Duke cricket balls refusing to swing. In his view the game is diminished as a result.The committee was keen to discover the reasons for the delay in the completion of the South London Astrodome, which will allow short-form cricket to be played in England throughout the year. The issue of salary caps in county cricket was raised but soon dismissed when it became apparent Surrey was the only club with the resources to come anywhere close to the limits laid down by the ECB and the PCA.Looking ahead Strauss confirmed he would be in Sydney later in the year for the celebrations marking the centenary of the birth of Richie Benaud he said he would be attending the service of thanksgiving at Randwick, which is to be conducted by the Rev David Warner. Those expected to travel to Sydney for the occasion include prominent broadcasters Stuart Broad and Mark Wood. The MCC president, Ebony Rainford-Brent, will also be in attendance.Finally Strauss was upbeat about the domestic game in England. The 50-over competition, which was reinvigorated by the 2027 World Cup win, was won by Worcestershire at Trent Bridge. Meanwhile the Championship with its 12-team premier ision was won for the third time in five years by Somerset. The reduced second ision, comprising six semi-professional teams and only five four-day fixtures, was headed by Derbyshire, who now replace Leicestershire in the top ision.The traditional climax to the season, the Blast final, was another rip-roaring success played out in front of a sell-out crowd at Edgbaston. When Strauss was asked how anyone had ever entertained the idea that the Blast should be threatened or superseded by a competition called The Hundred at the start of the decade, he replied tersely: “I’m not here to talk about ancient history.” One of his aides was more forthcoming at the suggestion of revisiting the Hundred concept. “There’s more chance of getting shit from a rocking horse.”• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email.

When we’ve had a bad performance and haven’t started so great, the way we’ve bounced back in the next game has been outstanding.

A century after staging the Open for the first time, Troon will welcome the world’s top players for the 10th occasion, just seven years after Henrik Stenson lifted the Claret Jug following an epic duel with Phil Mickelson.The R\u0026ampA’s chief executive, Martin Slumbers, said: “The 100th anniversary at Royal Troon is important and it’s a great course. It throws up some very exciting finishes, it has terrific infrastructure and with it hosting the omen’s Open in August it’s nice to keep some momentum going. It ticks a lot of boxes.”Slumbers admitted that the size of the crowds which each of the 10 courses on the Open rota can accommodate has become an increasingly important factor. That is bad news for the likes of Muirfield and Turnberry, with Muirfield attracting 142,306 spectators in 2013 and Turnberry’s remote location traditionally resulting in even lower figures.“There is no doubt that we have great aspirations for the game. We need to invest more and more. We wish to grow the Women’s Open. This is the first year we are in complete control of it and I’m excited about that, but that takes money.”Muirfield, which is owned and run by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, was removed from the Open rota after a vote to admit women members narrowly failed to achieve the two-thirds majority required in May 2016. It was restored in March 2017 when a second ballot saw members vote to admit women by 498 votes to 123. Twelve women are now understood to be members.“What we’re spending a lot of our time on is how do we get 200,000 people around Muirfield?” Slumbers added. “How do we get Muirfield to be Edinburgh’s Open?”St Andrews has already been confirmed to host the 2025 Open and with the R\u0026ampA unlikely to stage the event in Scotland for three years running, Royal Portrush or one of the English courses would be favourite for 2024.That would mean the earliest Turnberry, which is owned by the US President Donald Trump, could host the Open is 2026, 17 years after Stewart Cink defeated Tom Watson there in a play-off.“Infrastructure is one of the key issues we need to solve at Turnberry,” Slumbers added. “I am sure it will stage an Open there in the not-too-distant future.”With various sporting events being postponed or cancelled due to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus, Slumbers said the R\u0026ampA is taking a “watching brief”.The Women’s Amateur Asia-Pacific Championship was originally scheduled for Thailand in February but has been delayed until October, and Slumbers added: “We don’t really get going again now until April, so another six to eight weeks, and who knows what could happen. We’ll see where we go on that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39d3c954697e3087bffe2bfc7f293dc44ade57dc/0_144_5068_3041/master/5068.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3391451f3047c1912128a192c23c0fde","title":"team gb cyclists need to show olympic form at world championships","story":"World championships start in Berlin with all eyes on Jason and Laura Kenny five months before Tokyo 2020The final world championships before the Olympic Games is the point when reality, good or bad, hits home for Britain’s track cyclists, and the withdrawal of the governing body’s main sponsor HSBC the day before the event began is a bigger reality check than most. The pressure is always felt in the final major competition before the climax of the Olympic cycle – it has been that way all through British Cycling’s lottery‑funded glory years – but this week in Berlin it will be just that little bit more acute.The Olympic runes will be acutely read as per usual, but the waters will be muddied because in the past four years the pool of nations competing at the highest level appears to have widened, times have plummeted in the two team pursuits, while from a British perspective the medal bankers such as the men’s and women’s team pursuit quartets have not been at their levels of previous years.The past two Olympic cycles show a definite pattern: GB tread water at world championships in non‑Olympic years, picking up one or two gold medals and usually finishing between fourth and sixth. The 2013 triumph in Minsk, with five golds and a finish atop the medal table, now looks like an aberration. What cannot be argued is at this point in the Olympic cycle there is always a significant upturn in the team’s fortunes, even if not on the scale of Manchester in 2008, with nine gold medals of a possible 18.The room for improvement is obvious: last year in Pruskow, Poland, the team’s haul of only four medals was relatively low, with no victories in any Olympic events – Elinor Barker’s women’s scratch gold was the highlight – even if it was not on the scale of the catastrophe in Paris in 2015. As ever, it is time for the team’s senior members to step up.Jason Kenny requires one more to match Sir Chris Hoy as Britain’s most prolific gold medallist, but he has enjoyed a typically restrained time between Games, including a year out of the sport which led to speculation over his retirement at one point he will be closely watched in the sprint events – where the Dutch have raised the bar since Rio – as this point in the cycle is when he usually emerges from hibernation. His wife, Laura, is getting over a shoulder fracture from last month, and now has her status as the team’s go-to omnium rider threatened by the Scot Katie Archibald.Another mainstay is the men’s team pursuit rider Ed Clancy, now almost 35 with a gold medal‑winning record at the discipline that goes back to 2005. Clancy’s record now includes a further four world pursuit titles and three Olympic golds. “He’s the most successful rider in the history of the event,” the men’s endurance coach, Iain Dyer, said. “He’s going for a fourth Olympic gold in a row, he’s highly motivated and we’d all like to be part of that success.”The championships open on Wednesday with the men’s and women’s team pursuits, both of which are usually Team GB’s strongest suits. The hope is both deliver on the first evening, creating useful momentum for the next four days, but that task looks more complicated than in the past. The men’s event used to be a straightforward match between Britain and Australia, but those days are gone.Another perennial question at this point is how much of their aerodynamic kit the various teams have thrown into the winter, when qualifying for the world championships and Olympics is at stake, and how much is being held back. Dyer said it is hard to tell precisely where his team sit, because “we’ve deployed very little as yet, so what the package brings has yet to be realised”.While the men’s quartet won the world title in the Netherlands in 2018, the GB women have been unable to replicate the dominant form they showed between London and Rio, without a world title since then. But Barker, another relative veteran, said they are feeling no more pressure than usual in spite of the strong showings from their old rival Australia – the gold medallists last year – the USA and New Zealand. “We are desperate to win every single race, we are aware of it, but winning runs always come to an end. There is never any room for complacency.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d37ebc6271dce3ebedf5e956109d6b42f98bf00e/0_166_4211_2526/master/4211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0f3fc5ad38570501ab82e7796f2c98c","title":"racewalkers long march for equality deserves recognition at tokyo 2020","story":"The 50km walk may be unglamorous and a little absurd but seven female athletes’ legal fight with the IOC is worth backingTo Lausanne then, home of the International Olympic Committee, and the source last week of an exciting press release about the latest developments in its “global licencing strategy”. The IOC has teamed up with the toy manufacturer Mattel, which has designed a set of Olympic-themed Barbie dolls. “The collaboration with Mattel is a great way to engage with an important audience, our younger fans and their families, and through these high-quality products to connect them with the Olympic brand and values” sayzzzzz, sorry, says Timo Lumme, managing director of IOC television and marketing servicezzzzz. The new line is designed to highlight the IOC’s spirit of “inclusivity and innovation”.“Innovation” because Barbie is taking part in the hip new sports the Olympics has brought in – “How do you do fellow kids?” – to win over a younger audience. So we have skateboarding Barbie, surfing Barbie, sports climbing Barbie, and kick-ass karate Barbie – more power to her pink plastic elbow. “Inclusivity” because … actually, on that, one second. There is one thing that Barbie definitely won’t be doing this summer, even though you’d think her stiff limbs might make her a natural at it – the 50km racewalk.Women aren’t allowed to race over the distance, even though the IOC charter states that gender discrimination is “incompatible with the Olympic movement”.Right around the time the IOC was putting the finishing touches on that press release, the last twists in this little story were unfolding just across the other side of Lausanne, at the court of arbitration for sport, where seven female athletes were fighting the IOC for the right to compete in the 50km race this summer. The court decided that it was out of its jurisdiction, which means the 50km will be the one event on the Olympic athletics schedule in which women are not allowed to compete. The crux of the problem is that World Athletics only asked the IOC to consider including the event in the programme in December 2018, 18 months after the deadline. The IOC says this left it too little time to change the schedule.There are a couple of problems with this argument. One is the women’s 50km would be held on the same course, on the same day, as the men’s event, just like it was at the last two world athletics championships. The idea that this little inconvenience is a little too much inconvenience for the IOC to deal with in the 18 months it had to work in was somewhat undermined when, eight months later, it unilaterally decided to shift all five of the men’s and women’s marathons and race walks from Tokyo 500 miles north to Sapporo because it was so worried about how it would look if the athletes started keeling over in the heat.You’ll be beginning to figure, by now, that its objection isn’t really about logistics.Because there are people at the IOC, and maybe even World Athletics, who would happily get rid of the men’s competition too. There are already plans to replace the 50km race with a 30km race, and the 20km race with a 10km race. Which some people at the IOC seem to think is 10km too many. As long ago as 2003 they warned that racewalking was “on trial” as an Olympic event. You don’t need to be an IOC mandarin to understand why. It is a perfectly absurd sport with tricky rules and a tiny audience, strange and ungainly, memorably described by the NBC commentator Bob Costas as “a contest to see who can whisper the loudest”.It wasn’t always that way: back in the 19th century pedestrianism was one of the most popular events going. In 1815 so many people went to Blackheath common to watch a man walk in a loop for 1,000 miles that the police arrested him for causing a breach of the peace. There were “tens of thousands of idle and disorderly persons” there. The heath was, apparently, “alive with acrobats and rope-walkers, fire-eaters and ballad singers, dog fights and pony races. Brothels were brought in from London to the spot, and drunkenness and debauchery were rife upon every part of Blackheath.”So racewalking doesn’t pull in the crowds quite like it used to. But what it does have, these days, is a small, passionate community entirely dedicated to it, and who don’t give a damn that none of the rest of us really get it. People such as the US attorney Paul DeMeester, who led the legal challenge to get the women’s 50km into the Olympics.DeMeester explains his sport this way: “Racewalking is a long-distance discipline. When we want to catch the bus arriving at the corner, we sprint. Late for an appointment downtown, we jog at a steady pace like a miler. When having to cover a great distance, we walk. Race walking in a competitive context makes sense only over distances longer than the ones we typically contest in running events.”Which is why it matters so much to him, and the thousands of others like him, that women should be allowed to compete over 50km as well as 20km. DeMeester compares the seven women who brought the case against the IOC to Kathrine Switzer, who fought so hard for the right to run in the Boston marathon.The IOC is not going to be able to sell many Barbie dolls off the back of the race walking competition, it’s not going to pull in millions of new viewers, and it won’t play well with the Generation Z demographic it covets, but it will serve the small group of athletes who practise this punishingly difficult discipline athletes who don’t do it for the money, or the fame, but for the love of it athletes who live, and compete, in utter obscurity athletes who see the Olympics as the very pinnacle of their sport. The very sort of people the Games ought to be for, and was, once upon a time, if not any more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a222b38392aaae27e77664b9ce8d8636d59b466/0_207_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47f6483c5a2778f297732807be3e14ad","title":"how have your travel plans been affected by the coronavirus","story":"We want to hear from those who have cancelled or rearranged travel plans due to the outbreakItaly and Iran have been forced to introduce travel restrictions due to major outbreaks in both countries.

Dawn Dunning, an aspiring actor who Weinstein lured to the InterContinental hotel in Manhattan then offered her movie roles on the condition she had a threesome with him and another woman, endured that humiliation in 2004.The actor Ashley Judd, who was not involved in the trial, alleges the movie producer sexually harassed her in 1996, while her fellow star Rose McGowan says she was sexually assaulted by him the following year.Weinstein continues to insist that all his sexual encounters were consensual. But with 105 women now having leveled accusations against him, and with his sentencing set for 11 March, how he managed to avoid trouble for decades is now a burning issue.Much of the answer appears to lie in the army of helpers he deployed to deflect and silence his accusers. Glimpses of that horde of auxiliaries – the word “enablers” has been used – flashed up in the course of the seven-week trial.They ranged from the lowly limousine drivers employed to transport women discreetly to “business meetings” in hotel rooms to the internationally – renowned lawyers who drew up gagging non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). The court also heard of Black Cube, the firm of corporate private detectives founded by former Israeli intelligence agents.A key element of the elaborate network of Weinstein helpers were the female assistants. At trial, the jury heard of several who were used to arrange “appointments” with his potential victims, luring them with offers of auditions or production jobs, then making them disappear when all was done.Some of the assistants appear to have themselves been abused. The other woman in Weinstein’s intended threesome with Dunning was his assistant who was present in the hotel room when he made the proposition.The assistant’s lawyer has told the  that she is still traumatized from the brief time she worked for the film producer and is “a victim of Weinstein herself”.Other Weinstein acquaintances testified in court and denied the role they were alleged to have played in enabling Weinstein to molest young women. Claudia Salinas, a Mexican model, disputed in front of the jury the account given by one of the six accusers, Lauren Young, who said she was trapped with Weinstein inside a bathroom in a Beverly Hills hotel in 2013 after Salinas shut the door on them.Weinstein then went on to grope Young and masturbate in front of her, she said.“I would never close the door on anybody, ever,” Salinas countered.Once journalists from the New York Times and the New Yorker began to investigate the Hollywood titan’s track record with women, Weinstein took his network to another level. Over the years he wielded NDAs like weapons, reaching multiple settlements with women in which they received large payouts in return for their absolute silence.Many top lawyers were recruited in the effort. When their names emerged in the flurry of revelations that triggered the #MeToo movement, eyebrows were sharply raised.They included David Boies, a giant among liberal lawyers in America who until his work for Weinstein became public knowledge was best known for having represented Al Gore in his epic fight with George Bush in the 2000 presidential election and for his efforts on behalf of same-sex marriage.One of the jaw-dropping disclosures was that Boies contracted private detectives to try to foil the New York Times from exposing Weinstein at a time when the lawyer was also employed as a legal counsel to the newspaper. The Times promptly severed relations with him.Farrow revealed that it was Boies’s signature on the contract with Black Cube, the detective outfit populated by many former Mossad agents. At the trial at the New York supreme court the same contract was discussed in legal argument, with prosecutors noting that Black Cube was expecting to be paid $300,000 if they succeeded in scuppering the New York Times investigation.Another helper who raised eyebrows was Lisa Bloom, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who made her name representing the victims of sexual abuse, including several of the women trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein. Her reputation as a champion for survivors imploded when it emerged she had been retained by Weinstein in 2016 to help him beat back his detractors.In one devastating email from Bloom to the movie mogul, she said she felt equipped to help him “against the Roses of the world” – a reference to Rose McGowan. “They start out as impressive, bold women, but the more one presses for evidence, the weaknesses and lies are revealed … Clearly she must be stopped in her ridiculous, defamatory attacks on you.”In a recent interview with the , Bloom declined to admit she had written the memo, citing legal action. “Everything in that memo, if I did say it, I certainly don’t believe now,” she said.The final layer that has to be scrutinised in any post-trial reckoning involves the criminal justice system itself. Over decades law enforcement and prosecutors failed to engage with Weinstein despite some clear signals.This is an especially sensitive subject in the wake of the New York trial which was prosecuted under Cyrus Vance, the New York district attorney. In 2015 the same Cyrus Vance decided not to prosecute Weinstein after a Filipina-Italian model Ambra Gutierrez alleged he had groped her, even though she had obtained a taped audio recording in which the movie mogul made what sounded like a confession."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8de4d3172f3367b212309ab35abbdb5b1d3ed1b4/0_138_848_509/master/848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a1e8254b022ccf8565e6c5f149ed981","title":"irans deputy health minister i have coronavirus","story":"Feverish Iraj Harirchi says disease ‘doesn’t distinguish between statesman and ordinary citizen’Iran’s deputy health minister said he has contracted the coronavirus and placed himself in isolation, a day after appearing feverish at a press conference in which he downplayed its spread in the shrine city of Qom and said mass quarantines were unnecessary.Iraj Harirchi posted a video on social media on Tuesday acknowledging he had caught the virus, which appears to be taking rapid hold in parts of Iran. The news has underscored widespread fears that the outbreak may have passed a tipping point, before authorities had been able to gauge its full extent.Images of one of the country’s most senior public health officials appearing sweaty and pale and acknowledging he had contracted the disease left many Iranians deeply troubled and are likely to further paralyse a county reeling from its rapid onset. In the short video, Hirachi acknowledged that “many may get infected” echoing concerns that have taken root in the rest of the Middle East, which is home to millions of people living in densely packed refugee camps.“I wanted to tell you that I got corona,” said Harirchi. “I had a fever yesterday. The tests came back positive last night. I isolated myself. Just a few moments ago, I was told that the final test came. I’ll start taking medicine. Generally, I feel fine. I just felt a bit tired, I had a fever, and it will drop.“We’ll defeat corona. Be assured. I’m saying this deep from my heart. This virus is democratic, and it doesn’t distinguish between poor and rich or statesman and an ordinary citizen.“Many might get infected, but we have enough effective medicine, take care of yourselves. Take care of the nurses and doctors who work heroically.”Iran has become the regional focal point of fears surrounding coronavirus. Neighbouring states have largely shut their borders and suspended pilgrimage routes. Schools and universities in many parts of the country have been closed. Four new cases were suspected to have been diagnosed in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Tuesday. If confirmed, it would take the national tally to five cases, a number that is widely expected to rise, possibly substantially, in the coming days. Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman also reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran.Meanwhile, Turkey erted a plane from Tehran, which had been destined for Istanbul, to its capital Ankara, after 17 passengers were reported to have higher than average temperatures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/974a885ed87b4fb3f217a80cb9d5e2053696967b/0_162_4158_2495/master/4158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e7858151b1f46d3768f46936e9c7b92","title":"no one has told us anything tourists on lockdown in tenerife hotel coronavirus","story":"Guests confined to hotel rooms over coronavirus say they do not know when they can leaveBritish tourists have been left in limbo waiting to learn their fate after the Tenerife hotel they are staying in was placed in lockdown due to coronavirus fears.Guests were confined to their rooms after an Italian doctor who stayed at the hotel tested positive for the potentially deadly virus. Despite warnings from experts that the quarantine of passengers and staff on the Diamond Princess ship may have been counterproductive, allowing the virus to spread, tourists fear they may be in for a similarly long stay at the hotel.Hannah Green, 27, from Hertfordshire, who is staying with her boyfriend and one-year-old son, told PA Media: “We woke up to a note under our door this morning saying for health reasons not to leave our room.“I called downstairs to reception as soon as I saw it and they wouldn’t tell us anything. So I quickly got on my phone and googled and saw a man had tested positive for coronavirus so I basically assumed it was that.“But since then, we’ve had nothing from the hotel – no one has told us anything or what’s going to happen.”She said that since arriving on Saturday they had experienced a “holiday for hell”, having also been confined to the hotel on Sunday because of the sandstorm that struck the Canary Islands.“We’re in our room with the baby,” said Green. We’re worried for the baby … I don’t think we’ll be allowed to leave. We don’t want to be here. We’re fed up now.”The four-star H10 Costa Adeje Palace, located on the seafront, has 467 rooms, four pools and three restaurants. The quarantine meant customers missed lunch, forcing them to raid their minibars, although guests said they received food packages later in the afternoon.Steve McHardy, 53, an estate agent from Kinross, in eastern Scotland, said he and his wife Susan, also 53, were supposed to leave on Tuesday but woke up to messages from friends who live on the island telling them of the situation. They decided to sunbathe instead but but then were told to go to their room around lunchtime, he said.“There’s no indication of whether we’ll get out when we’ve been tested or after 14 days,” he told the . “People questioned how many doctors are coming. If there’s 1,000 people, you don’t know how long it’s going to take to be tested and how they will decide in what order people are tested.”He praised hotel staff but said information had not been forthcoming. “We’ve got jobs and animals to go back to,” he said before adding with resignation: “It is what it is. It’s day one if I’m here in 17 days’ time, it might be a different conversation.”David Hoon, 60, and Pamela Scott, 63, from Matlock, Derbyshire, said the situation was very worrying.“Nobody is telling us what’s going on, how long this is going to last and who is going to feed us,” Hoon told MailOnline. “The way this has been handled is a disgrace.“The hotel is like a ghost house and my fear is that by trapping us inside it, we stand more chance of catching the coronavirus. This whole thing is very worrying.”A message on the hotel’s website said it would be closed until 15 March. It said it was “providing customers and hotel staff all the necessary care and attention so that, despite the inconveniences this situation may cause, they are taken care of in the best way possible”.The hotel was locked down after an Italian doctor complained of feeling ill and tested positive for the virus on Monday. The following day, the regional government announced that his wife had also tested positive.The Italian couple are thought to have spent six days at the four-star seafront hotel, which is used by the package holiday firms Tui and Jet2Holidays. They are believed to be from the north of Italy, where most of the country’s 283 cases have been reported.On Tuesday afternoon, the hotel, on the outskirts of Adeje, was guarded by police officers in face masks who declined to speak to the media, and a red barrier had been erected a few hundred metres from the main entrance.The shops, bars and restaurants inside had been sealed off, and staff who had turned up in the morning had been told to go home. A letter sent by managers to guests said they had to stay in their rooms.“H10 Hotels has implemented all health and operational recommendations from the health authorities to ensure the safety and wellbeing of customers and employees,” the hotel said.“Additionally, we are providing customers and hotel staff all the necessary care and attention so that, despite the inconveniences this situation may cause, they are taken care of in the best way possible.”Another British guest told Reuters he was among those in quarantine and complained of a lack of information.“We can see from the window there are security officers outside the hotel and about 50 hotel employees,” Christopher Betts said on the phone from his hotel room, adding that guests were asked to remain in their rooms.Betts said they had been allowed to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant but added: “We have received no information whatsoever.” He said he had not been tested for the virus.Ashotel, the association of hoteliers on Tenerife and four other Canary islands, called for calm and said the established protocols were in effect.“The hotel where the affected tourist was staying is doing everything it can to deal with the situation and is demonstrating complete responsibility and following all the steps laid out in the protocol,” said a spokeswoman.“The situation inside the hotel is normal all the customers are being kept informed about what’s going and are cooperating fully when it comes to following the recommendations laid out by the authorities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64e1f5759987fb1dfa54a92eb9639ef33c980902/0_85_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d0690291c1c6d27c4e34c2b9d636a6e","title":"uk travellers scramble to change plans as coronavirus spreads","story":"Many people unable to get refunds for trips as FCO holds back on official travel warningsAs the coronavirus spreads across Europe, the Middle East and Asia, Britons are scrambling to change their travel plans – with varying levels of success.“We’re feeling very frustrated and fed-up,” said a woman from Surrey, who preferred not to be named, and whose family had booked a “holiday of a lifetime” in Hong Kong, Thailand and Laos this Easter.Deciding they did not want to expose themselves to the risk of being taken ill, or a fortnight in quarantine upon their return, they have cancelled their trip.“We’ve probably lost £2,000 in internal flights and accommodation in Asia,” she said. “When we first spoke to our travel agent about the coronavirus they were very dismissive about it, saying people are in China still doing trips, but do you really want to spend three weeks with a face mask on?”The Foreign Office (FCO) has so far held back from advising against essential travel in Asia, besides mainland China, and this is hampering attempts to be reimbursed by people who cancelled holidays.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. It is also warning that travellers from Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand who develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath within 14 days of returning the UK should contact the NHS by phone.Clive Paul, a 71-year-old retiree, cancelled his holiday to Singapore and Australia on Monday amid intensified news coverage about the outbreak. He is set to lose about £2,500.“My insurance company will not refund anything unless the FCO tells tourists not to enter the country,” he said.“I haven’t got money to throw away but my wife and I had to make a decision. There’s probably a very small risk flying out there but who knows. Better to be safe than sorry. It’s a long flight, we don’t want to risk it. I’m gutted.”Michael Green, from Rossendale in Lancashire, got about halfway through his holiday before it was cut short.He was on the Majestic Princess cruise ship having a “wonderful time” along the coast of Australia with his wife Pamela for their 40th wedding anniversary, before they were told the voyage would end in Perth.Recent graduate Ludovic Gardner, 21, worked at Portsmouth city council to pay for six months travelling.Along with five friends, he had booked a trip from Moscow along the trans-Mongolian railway to Beijing and Shanghai and then planned to go to Tokyo.“We had all our accommodation and flights to Japan booked, but because of restrictions placed on those who have been to China it’s now all up in the air,” he said.“We cancelled our visit to China and flights to Japan, but our refund from Peach Aviation can only be spent on flights from China, so it’s not really a refund at all.”Prof Loughlin Sweeney, who has been carrying out research in the UK, said he had no choice but to return to South Korea, where he lives and works.“The university semester in Korea will now be starting two weeks late, and some of our students will be quarantined,” he said.En route back to his home in Seoul he will be attempting to minimise contact with the “outside world” since he is acutely aware he is running a “possibly unnecessary risk by travelling back into an infection zone” – though Sweeney’s colleagues in Korea assure him they are safe.“The only scary thing about it is what we don’t yet know about the virus,” he said. “Hopefully the fatality rate won’t climb any higher.”Karisa Lundberg, 31, an American who lives in London, is urging people to reclaim a sense of perspective.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 25 February, the outbreak has affected 80,000 people globally. In mainland China there have been 2,663 deaths among 77,658 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. More than 12,000 people affected in China have already recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least other 30 other countries. The most badly affected include Japan, with 850 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and four deaths. Italy has recorded 229 cases and seven deaths, while South Korea has recorded 893 cases and eight deaths. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, Iran and the Philippines.There have been 13 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/728a8daf5c1ce78620f5269e4f8f7f57b4cc7ef4/0_34_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5acf4f85880f8e7d546ac89b07403a28","title":"rio carnival 2020 in pictures","story":"Brazil’s famed carnival kicked off in earnest on Saturday as millions of revellers poured into the streets, some of whom took aim at the nation’s deeply polarised politics.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4184726.1582652222!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"could ireland put towns under lockdown if coronavirus arrived","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDuring a containment phase, school closures ‘are not justified’, according to a European Centre for Disease Control document. Photograph: iStockItaly has responded to the arrival of multiple cases of coronavirus by putting towns under lockdown, closing schools and sending restaurant customers home early. Could the same happen in Ireland if the disease were to arrive?Ireland is currently trying to prevent the spread of Covid-19 to these shores, it seems successfully so far. Therefore, the situation is quite different from that in Italy, for now at least, where 270 cases and seven deaths have been reported.Yet even in this containment phase, the cancellation of mass gatherings in the State “may be justified in exceptional circumstances”, according to a technical report on measures to delay and mitigate the coronavirus drawn up by the European Centre for Disease Control.It gave the example of large conferences with a significant number of participants from a highly affected area, but says the decision to cancel will need to be co-ordinated with the organiser and public health authorities on a case-by-case basis.During a containment phase, school closures “are not justified”, the document states. “There are also no data to support informed decisions on proactive school closures in terms of their anticipated effectiveness in mitigating the ... epidemic, due to the unknown level of transmission of this virus among children.”However, should transmission of the virus become widespread, school closures “may be necessary”, even though they probably will not reduce the impact of the epidemic, according to the European Centre for Disease Control.Existing powersSuch is the guidance on which Irish public health authorities are relying. The other issue is whether they actually have the powers to enforce restrictions on people’s movement if deemed necessary.The short answer is that they do, though these powers are spread across a variety of public health and public order laws and regulations.Covid-19 is now a notifiable disease, under regulations signed by Minister for Health Simon Harris last week. This means, for example, a doctor has the power to detain a probable case of infection where a person refuses to comply with infection prevention and control protocols.“The foot and mouth scare some years ago was a good example of gardaí regulating traffic movement to protect against the threat.”However, Prof Walsh believes the threat posed by the coronavirus represents “a wholly novel situation for which there is no bespoke legislation in place”.“Given that a Government-imposed lockdown on the movement of peoples in or out of a town (or prohibition on mass gatherings such as a concert or sports fixture) would constitute a serious encroachment on the constitutionally protected fundamental rights of the inidual, I would expect the Government would seek to secure the enactment of emergency legislation giving it the powers to take such measures.”Such legislation would benefit from the protections against constitutional review in the courts if adopted pursuant to a constitutionally declared emergency, he says.Travel restrictionsThe European Centre for Disease Control document says broad domestic travel restrictions may have a small positive impact in delaying an epidemic only if they are implemented at an early stage.“Such restrictions may be effective in specific, isolated settings, but are unlikely to have significant impact on transmission in modern, mainly urban societies within the EU,” it says.“They are expected to have significant economical, legal and ethical implications. Therefore, such restrictions may be considered only during the containment phase of epidemics of high severity.”According to Dr Eoin O’Dell, a law professor at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland enjoys a greater freedom than many other countries in Europe in terms of imposing restrictions on movement between states because it is not a signatory to the Schengen Agreement, which removed border controls between many EU states.However, with post-Brexit UK introducing measures that are at variance with the EU’s, there may be a disparity in approaches on either side of the Border in Ireland, and this could prove problematic."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4184793.1582656859!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu issues ultimatum to london ahead of brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier gives a press conference in Brussels on Tuesday. Photograph: Geert Vanden WijngaertBloombergEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned Britain the bloc was ready to play hardball in coming Brexit negotiations as member states signed off on a common negotiating stance on Tuesday.“We will not conclude an agreement at any price,” Mr Barnier warned in an animated press conference in which he expressed exasperation with indications from the British government that it could renege on prior accords.“The trade agreement will be associated with a fisheries agreement, and an agreement about a level playing field, or there won’t be any agreement at all,” he said.The EU says it is prepared to begin talks as soon as Monday, after representatives of the 27 member states formally adopted a joint negotiating position. The document says Britain can only be granted privileged trade access to the EU if it aligns with standards and rules to prevent it undercutting the Single Market: the so-called level playing field arrangements that London has vowed to reject.If no deal is reached, onerous tariffs and customs requirements will automatically come into force between Britain and Ireland – and the rest of the EU – at the end of 2020, unless an extension of the UK’s transition period can be agreed by July.EU states hardened their positions amid British media reports that Boris Johnson’s government had ordered its Brexit team to identify how to evade implementing checks and controls between Britain and Northern Ireland – a key part of last year’s exit deal.Mr Barnier, a former French minister and EU commissioner, noted that the Irish protocol had been signed into law and passed by the House of Commons “following negotiation over each word and line with the British government and with the prime minister Boris Johnson himself”.At one point during the press conference, Mr Barnier thumped his podium as he declared: “All those words are in there, they were agreed by the British.”Irish protocolThe EU’s negotiating mandate makes achievement of a deal conditional on the implementation of prior agreements, and pledges protection of the Belfast Agreement. It states that any accord must “ensure that issues arising from Ireland’s unique geographic situation are addressed”.Under the Irish protocol agreed as part of Britain’s 2019 Brexit withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland is to remain in line with the EU rules required to avoid a hard border across the island. This entails that checks must take place between Northern Ireland and Britain, the extent of which depend on the future relationship deal and how much Britain erges from EU norms when it exits its transition period at the end of this year.A joint committee is now being established to monitor whether there is sufficient development of the infrastructure required to enforce the edge of the world’s largest economic area along the Irish Sea, with progress expected within months.EU observers were alarmed when Northern Ireland secretarty Brandon Lewis used his first official trip to Belfast to announce there would be no such border.“There are reasons for us to be vigilant, because the British minister in charge of Northern Ireland has come up with some very surprising statements,” Mr Barnier said on Tuesday.“I’d like him to take some time to read through the withdrawal agreement in detail and he will see what commitments have been entered into.”Earlier, Tánaiste Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told reporters that Britain’s prospects of securing “even a bare bones trade agreement” would be seriously damaged unless it made significant preparations to implement an Irish Sea border.“If there isn’t progress on the infrastructure needed to implement the Irish protocol as part of the withdrawal agreement in the next few months then I think that is going to be a very worrying signal for whether or not it’s going to be possible to conclude something sensible for the end of the year,” Mr Coveney said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Alan Betson  The The two held preliminary discussions on Tuesday afternoon. Mr Martin said he would “reflect” on the conversation and another meeting will be arranged.“I did put to him that we were willing to engage and that we were of the view that both parties should commence discussions even on an exploratory basis in terms of policy, in terms of a program for government.”He said the Taoiseach did not reject that. In a statement after the meeting, Mr Varadkar said the two leaders agreed to meet again but “Fine Gael continues to prepare for opposition”.Mr Varadkar “encouraged Fianna Fáil to continue engaging with other parties with a view to forming a government”.The two leaders “exchanged views on a number of matters including housing, climate change, health, cost of living, the economy and taxation”, according to the Taoiseach.Mr Martin said there had not been any substantial progress in the efforts of Sinn Féin or other parties to form a left-wing alliance.He added it was a “very unlikely scenario” for Sinn Féin to emerge with “any credible numbers to form a government”.Fianna Fáil will begin a series of policy based discussions with the Green Party on Wednesday. Mr Martin said he wanted to see the Greens involved in government.“We need that policy dynamic in a government to ensure there is real delivery” on issues such as climate change.Mr Martin said the Irish public “expect us to get stuck in”.He said that while no one had ruled out a reverse confidence-and-supply arrangement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael there was a valid point to be made about the arithmetic potentially not stacking up.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has criticised Mr Martin’s decision not to talk to her party about government formation, saying: “I hope the leader of Fianna Fáil changes his position but he may not.”Ms McDonald said that, in contrast to his decision not to talk to Sinn Féin, Mr Martin’s “eagerness to run into the arms of Fine Gael is lost on no one”. Independent TDs Mr Martin also held talks with the regional independent group which is a new group of nine TDs.He said they impressed upon him the need to speed up the tempo of government formation talks and also spoke of the importance of creating a stable coalition.“Their view is strongly that a government that will be formed needs underpinning in terms of going the distance.”The regional independent group also held exploratory talks with Fine Gael.“While the group operates as a technical group in Dáil Éireann, the members felt it was imperative they express the views of their constituents that there is now an urgent need to form a stable and effective government to address the issues facing the country,” said the group’s convenor Denis Naughten.“The group had a useful exchange of views and await developments by all the political parties.”Other members of the group are Cathal Berry, Sean Canney, Peter Fitzpatrick, Noel Grealish, Michael Lowry, Verona Murphy, Matt Shanahan and Peadar Toibin.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Jury shown deadly shrapnel from Manchester Arena bombPolice had seized firearms from husband alleged to have killed his wifeQueen hears how her father\u0026#39s fake \u0026#39royal visits\u0026#39 helped win the Second World WarContenders square off in race to succeed Angela MerkelMet rules in favour of woman who claimed undercover officer deceived her into a sexual relationshipCoronavirus latest news: disease spreads across Europe into Switzerland, Croatia and AustriaCCTV images show Manchester Arena bomber 19 seconds before he launched suicide attackMalala Yousafzai meets Greta Thunberg at University of Oxford as she hints she will join climate strikeAngus Robertson pledges to support Nicola Sturgeon, not replace her if he wins Holyrood seat battleComment: Free speech is everything for my generation - but only if you\u0026#39re Left-wingWhat is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?Humans in Asia survived volcanic super-eruption 70,000 years ago, study revealsDowning Street rejects EU\u0026#39s level playing field demands as trade talks set to start on MondayMonkey business: Baboon trio recaptured after going on run in SydneyComment: It\u0026#39s far too simplistic to blame lower life expectancy growth on austerityFewer rich and poor Scottish pupils leaving school with National or Higher qualificationsTuesday evening news briefing: Hotel in Tenerife on lockdown after guest contracts coronavirusJohn Swinney condemns visit to primary one pupils by sexually explicit drag queen called FlowJob Riot police clash with residents on Greek islands over new migrant campsOldest living man dies aged 112: Here\u0026#39s what he attributed his long life to We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/18/TELEMMGLPICT000225097601_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"free speech everything generation left wing","story":"When members of Extinction Rebellion vandalised a Cambridge University lawn, authorities simply looked the other way From art galleries and the BBC to Brexit and climate change, you can\u0027t be right unless you\u0027re LeftOne of the things that comes with being privileged and well educated is a certain sense of arrogance in the validity of one\u0027s views. And among the many advantages of living in a democracy is the absolute freedom to express them. Which is all very well, so long as you\u0027re on the right, or in this case the Left, side of the fence. Alas, from where I’m standing, the only place most Conservatives feel they can be honest with their ideologies today is behind the screen at a polling station. From politicians to actors, there is seemingly no limit to the sort of thing you can say in public so long as you’re not a Tory. On the contrary, when Labour MP David Lammy was called out last year for equating members of the European Research Group to Nazis and proponents of apartheid, he reflected that his remarks weren’t strong enough”. A month later, when comedian Jo Brand was responding on BBC Radio 4 to news that a protester had hurled a milkshake at Nigel Farage, she quipped: Why bother when you could get some battery acid? It ruffled a few feathers but was largely taken exactly in the spirit which it was meant: as a joke. But when actor Laurence Fox, appearing in January for the same broadcaster on Question Time, rolled his eyes and dared to suggest that Meghan Markle\u0027s unpopularity in the UK was not all down to racism, the actors\u0027 union Equity declared him as a “disgrace to our industry. Fox announced yesterday that he would be quitting social media, such was the voracity of the backlash. I was unsurprised, therefore, to learn this week of a report that revealed more than 80 per cent of those working in the British arts and culture sector feel unable to air Right-leaning views on politics for fear of being professionally ostracised. ArtsProfessional’s Freedom of Expression survey gathered testimony from more than 500 employees one stating “it wouldn’t be advisable to point out that the arts tend to do well under the Tories,” as an example.Oh yes, art institutions are doing so well, thank you very much, that they\u0027ve been turning down vast sums of money from donors attached to dynasties that don\u0027t fit the PC narrative. The National Portrait Gallery last year refused £1m from The Sackler Trust because of family ties to the manufacture of OxyContin. Months later, protesters pushed Canadian philanthropist  and longtime human rights advocate Yana Peel to step down from the board of The Serpentine over (and if this sounds overly convoluted, it\u0027s because it is) her erstwhile shareholding in a company within the same corporate structure as a fund managed by her husband that owned a share in a company which has been criticised by Amnesty International. She could hardly quit her family, so she left her job joining that 80 per cent of her industry who feel they must keep quiet in the process.Meanwhile the loud and proud social justice warriors - not satisfied with stifling dissent in the art world or digging up lawns in Cambridge as university officials whistle and look the other way - have found something new to boycott in their droves on social media: a brand of aromatic beverage. Why? Because our new Chancellor Rishi Sunak, before he’s even had the chance to do anything remotely controversial, posted a photo of himself with a sack of Yorkshire Tea on Twitter. Just imagine this sort of berserk response coming from the Right, when three years ago Jeremy Corbyn said sneeringly that he’d offer Trump a “cuppa” of the same brand. A Conservative-led embargo on Yorkshire Tea? Well, that would be discrimation against northerners.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The consensus forecast was for an £11.4bn surplus.This meant that borrowing in the current financial year-to-date, covering April 2019 to January 2020, was £44.8bn –\u0026nbsp£5.8bn or 14.9 per cent more than in the same period the previous year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIf the trend continues over February and March, the full-year deficit will be around £45bn, according to analysts at Investec Bank. This would still be below the £47.6bn that the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast.An improvement in revenue thanks to a record £16.2bn collected through self-assessment was cancelled out by a 3.6 per cent annual increase in spending –\u0026nbspday-to-day rather than investment expenditure, reflecting increases in spending on health, social care and education pledged by former prime minister Theresa May.Budget to go ahead in March, new chancellor confirmsSpending by government departments rose by 6.5 per cent compared with a year earlier. Total spending, including capital investment, rose by 5.5 per cent. The current budget in the fiscal year so far was in deficit by £7.2bn.Under the fiscal rules set by former chancellor Sajid Javid, who resigned earlier this month, the government must balance the current budget over three years, although borrowing for infrastructure is allowed up 3 per cent of GDP, which would allow an extra £22bn of public sector net investment a year.“While the current fiscal rule, would still allow a large rise in public investment, the rise in the deficit makes the ambition of balancing the current budget deficit more restrictive,” said Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at analysts Capital Economics.Mr Sunak said this week he would stick with the 11 March date for the government’s first post-Brexit Budget, ending speculation that the plans, which are likely to entail a big increase in spending, would be delayed.Philip Shaw, the chief UK economist at Investec, said the critical factor for next month’s Budget would be how much fiscal headroom there was to raise spending further beyond the plan for 2020-21 that Mr Javid set out last September.“The Conservatives’ manifesto committed the party to balancing the current budget during this parliament,” he\u0026nbspsaid.Mr Shaw added\u0026nbspthat how much room Mr Sunak had depended on precisely how this was defined, for example, which specific year in the parliament was used.“Our guess is that although there will not be much space for fiscal generosity, the chancellor will find some,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The consensus forecast was for an £11.4bn surplus.This meant that borrowing in the current financial year-to-date, covering April 2019 to January 2020, was £44.8bn –\u0026nbsp£5.8bn or 14.9 per cent more than in the same period the previous year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIf the trend continues over February and March, the full-year deficit will be around £45bn, according to analysts at Investec Bank. This would still be below the £47.6bn that the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast.An improvement in revenue thanks to a record £16.2bn collected through self-assessment was cancelled out by a 3.6 per cent annual increase in spending –\u0026nbspday-to-day rather than investment expenditure, reflecting increases in spending on health, social care and education pledged by former prime minister Theresa May.Budget to go ahead in March, new chancellor confirmsSpending by government departments rose by 6.5 per cent compared with a year earlier. Total spending, including capital investment, rose by 5.5 per cent. The current budget in the fiscal year so far was in deficit by £7.2bn.Under the fiscal rules set by former chancellor Sajid Javid, who resigned earlier this month, the government must balance the current budget over three years, although borrowing for infrastructure is allowed up 3 per cent of GDP, which would allow an extra £22bn of public sector net investment a year.“While the current fiscal rule, would still allow a large rise in public investment, the rise in the deficit makes the ambition of balancing the current budget deficit more restrictive,” said Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at analysts Capital Economics.Mr Sunak said this week he would stick with the 11 March date for the government’s first post-Brexit Budget, ending speculation that the plans, which are likely to entail a big increase in spending, would be delayed.Philip Shaw, the chief UK economist at Investec, said the critical factor for next month’s Budget would be how much fiscal headroom there was to raise spending further beyond the plan for 2020-21 that Mr Javid set out last September.“The Conservatives’ manifesto committed the party to balancing the current budget during this parliament,” he\u0026nbspsaid.Mr Shaw added\u0026nbspthat how much room Mr Sunak had depended on precisely how this was defined, for example, which specific year in the parliament was used.“Our guess is that although there will not be much space for fiscal generosity, the chancellor will find some,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And those quakes could shed important new light on how Mars came to be formed, as well as the rest of the Solar System.Other findings from the InSight spacecraft show that the Martian magnetic field is ten times stronger than expected.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInSight landed on Mars in November 2018, after a journey that saw it travel 300 million miles over a period of nearly seven months. Since then, it has been examining what exists underneath the Martian surface.Dr Bruce Barnerdt, InSight principal investigator and lead author on one of the studies, said: We finally have, for the first time, established that Mars is a seismically active planet.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

You depend on Nest cameras to keep an eye on your home and the people in it, so of course it’s frustrating when you can’t. For that, please accept my apology, said Rishi Chandra, vice president for Nest, in a post on the company\u0027s help page.We’ve rolled out a fix and most camera services should be working again. Unfortunately, video history wasn\u0027t collected during this incident.

In a flash, we had profound new information on the Iron Age Middle East,” said Dr Osborne, who specialises in examining the expression of political authority in Iron Age cities.\u0026nbspHe said it was “a marvellous, incredibly lucky find”.The Oriental Institute’s linguistic analysis suggested the engravings was made in the late-eighth-century BC, which lines up with the time Midas ruled.\u0026nbspThe stone also provides answers for a long-standing mystery: Less than 10 miles to the south of the ancient city is a volcano with a well-known inscription in hieroglyphics. It refers to a King Hartapu, but no one knew who he was – or what kingdom he ruled.University of Chicago\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Reflecting on his own experience, Mr Buttigieg told him:Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It took me a long time to figure out how to tell even my best friend that I was gay, let alone to go out there and tell the world.“And to see you willing to come to terms with who you are in a room full of 1,000 people, thousands of people you’ve never met, that’s really something.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Democratic candidates compete on the campaign trail: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jessica Canicosa, a precinct captain for Bernie Sanders, waits to greet caucus voters at Liberty High School in Henderson, NevadaA supporter of Amy Klobuchar in Las Vegas, NevadaHotel workers at the Bellagio in Las Vegas get to grips with voting papers during the Nevada caucusesMichael J Fox –\u0026nbspthe Back to the Future actor turned activist –\u0026nbspspeaks at a rally for Pete Buttigieg at Faiss Middle School in Las VegasVoters at a campaign event for Amy Klobuchar in Reno, NevadaA caricature of Bernie Sanders is projected on to a tree during a rally in Las VegasA woman waits to have a photo taken with Elizabeth Warren during a town hall meeting in Las VegasThe threat of coronavirus and other germ-borne illnesses was on some voters\u0027 minds at the Democratic caucuses in Henderson, NevadaFormer vice-president Joe Biden takes a selfie with a voter in Las Vegas ahead of the Nevada caucusesA member of Mike Bloomberg\u0027s election team in a campaign office in New York CityAmy Klobuchar changes her shoes backstage after giving a speech in Exeter, New HampshireA warmly-wrapped-up dog attends an Elizabeth Warren event at Amherst Elementary School in Nashua, New HampshireBernie Sanders, who romped to victory in New Hampshire against Hillary Clinton in 2016, talks to the media in ManchesterLisa Olney, of Wellesley, Massachussets, demonstrates her support for Elizabeth Warren in Nashua, New HampshireJoe Biden was hoping to improve on his poor showing in Iowa in the New Hampshire primaryElizabeth Warren, renowned for giving time to supporters for selfies, works the crowd at the University of New Hampshire in DurhamJoe Biden takes a selfie with a supporter and his child outside a campaign event in Somersworth, New Hampshire on 5 FebruaryElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders quarrel after a confrontation in a TV debate in which Sanders claimed that Warren was not telling the truth about a conversation in which she claimed he had said a woman could not win the presidency on 14 JanuarySupporter Pat Provencher listens to Pete Buttigieg in Laconia, New Hampshire on 4 FebruaryElizabeth Warren jogs away after speaking to reporters during a campaign event in Nashau, New HampshireSupporters of Amy Klobuchar gather before a rally.

But its simple for users to lie about their age.Last year an NSPCC report found that the  was responsible for six recorded cases of child sex and child abuse images offences.Now disgusted parents have told the Sun Online how their children have been sent explicit, inappropriate and threatening messages from strangers on the app.Thats why we launched our TikTok Time Bomb series - to raise awareness of the risks and urge the site to be better moderated so kids arent left to protect themselves online.Worried parent Nigel Wharton said: I checked my  year old sons account and found five private messages from adults...one telling him they love him.Mum-of-two Robyn Ganley, from Sunderland, was furious when she found a stranger had liked all her ten-year-old daughter Kais photos and commented on them saying wow.She told the Sun Online: I just happened to go through her phone that day and found it.It wasnt any of her friends contacting her, it was someone she didnt know. I reported the account.I was furious when I saw it. I deleted the app, but she re-downloaded it.I hate the app. It really frightens me as a parent how easy it is for people to contact my kids on there.A mum-of-one, from Bradford, who we have chosen not to name, was appalled by what she discovered on her ten-year-old nieces phone.She told the Sun Online: Debbie* was watching another childs live video when a private profile who had no picture started chatting to her via the live comments of the other childs video.This person kept asking personal questions and then proceeded to ask hershe had ever rubbed her private parts. I felt sick to my stomach.The police were called and an officer came to see Debbie.It’s become a magnet for paedophiles as well as a hotbed for violent and extremist content, with TikTok predators exploiting the s young user base and lax security to prey on the vulnerable.Weve seen kids as young as eight being groomed on TikTok, while other creeps take advantage of young girls posting sexualised content of themselves on the .And thats especially worrying on a site which is attracting millions more children every year, with  per cent of kids now owning a smartphone by the age of seven.Thats why we launched our TikTok Time Bomb series — to make sure parents are aware of the risks their kids are being exposed to, and what they can do to better protect them. Everyone agrees social media can be a force for good, but it has to be used the right way and with proper controls in place.We want TikTok to better moderate its content so that it’s not being left to kids to protect themselves online. They informed the family that there had been a lot of calls about similar incidents, where someone with a private profile without a photo had been sending vile messages to children.The mum added: What a lot of parents dont realise is that eventheir child has their account set to private, people can still contact them through comments on another childs video or through comments on another persons live video.The site is definitely not good for young children. Theres some really young people using it and its scary.The police talked to Debbie about the incident, online safety and the dangers of using TikTok.However, while they took the name of the private account, the family said they couldnt track who it was behind the profile.They explained: They [the police] said there are too many of them doing the same thing and it would take up too much of police time and money to follow it up.Another concerned parent Lynn Baldwin, whose nine-year-old son Shae was on the app, said it should be shut down.She said: The site is full of grown men grooming kids and vulnerable people, it should be banned.There were videos promoting drug taking and sexually suggestive content.Shae got lots of follow requests but when I checked them, they had no content on their accounts so I declined them.He was able to sign up when he was nine and no proof was needed of his age.Mum-of-two Carolyn Wilkins, , whose -year-old daughter Izzy uses the app, told Sun Online: Young girls are doing very inappropriate videos which they should not be doing at that age. I was shocked by that.I am in full support of the campaign being run by The Sun Online.In my view, as a parent of a child who uses the app, TikTok needs an overhaul of how the app operates.Its a  for any child groomer or paedophile. Content does not appear to be vetted and neither are user accounts, meaning it is possible for anyone to use it.Its a major personal security issue. I think young users are really putting themselves at risk.Luckily for me, my daughter is extremely savvy and regularly shows me how she uses the app.We have a close relationship and would never respond to anyone unusual.Mum-of-two Ami Roberts, , said she was shocked to find dark and uncomfortable content on the app.She told the Sun Online: What scared me most was the age of some of the children on the app. Who knows who is behind the screen watching When I downloaded the app, I quickly uncovered the dark side of TikTok and it terried me. I really do believe children and vulnerable people need to stay away from this app for their own safety.I saw videos of kids who must have been six or seven years old who were bopping around to music and lip syncing to silly Kardashian sound clips. It really scared me to see children that young on the app and to know their videos could be shown to anyone.She added: I am in full support of The Suns campaign. The app should be better moderated and safer for kids to use.Chris Moralee, , from Bradford, said he was disgusted by what he found on the app on his ten-year-old son Denvers phone.He said: His phone kept flashing up like someone had messaged. I kept seeing this same mans name coming up.The messages he received said ‘hello are you there ’, ‘stop f***ing ignoring me’, then he said ‘I will find you’, ‘where are you ’ He was sending these messages to a ten-year-old. Denver was terried.The person had a picture. I didn’t report it to police because I deleted the app, I wish I had told the police but I was keen to just get rid of it.I went on to my son’s phone to look at what had been sent and I looked at the content.He’s only ten…there must be a way for them to get parents’ permission to get on it. But there’s no way of them verying their age.I had to tell him that not everyone in the world is nice and people do use these sites to send horrible messages and threaten people and stuff.Mr Morales deleted the app on Denvers phone and his sons school held an assembly on the dangers of social media after he alerted them.Vigilante hunters have warned there are thousands of predators on TikTok - but often dont have the right tools to snare paedophiles on the worlds most downloaded app.Paedophile hunting groups claimed the app was a breeding ground for child predators but said they were limited in the powers they had to nail them.Vigilante group Dark Justice told the Sun Online: You can bet there will be thousands of paedophiles on the app. Its a horrible app.Its been a breeding ground since the very beginning with kids being asked to do stuff.You have paedophiles using fame grooming on kids...so they give likes and so on making kids feel popular and then attempt to get images from them.It should be shut down or made into a veried + app.However they said they couldnt use the app to catch paedophiles as they use still images, while TikTok is video based.Jersey-based paedophile hunter Cheyenne OConnor told the Sun Online:  per cent it is a magnet for paedophiles.Its one of the most used apps for children, every kid I know is on it. In every other video youll find vile comments to children. I would say it really is one of the worst at the moment.TikTok user Liz W, , who goes by the name @bitheoji on the app, explained how the app plays into the hands of predators.She said: If some creepy guy just keeps liking videos of younger girls doing similar audios or soundtracks or hashtags, those are going to keep coming up on his For You page.So its easier for him to find more victims. And I think thats what makes it so easy for predators to come on it and victimise young children.In our latest probe into TikTok we found a user with the name Jimmy Saviles Us.In less than five minutes we found comments underneath videos of schoolchildren dancing and singing such as Wowwww sooooo harrrdddd, Rahh lads be careful  on da line but looking good, Probs  lads, any of you up for sale, this song makes me horny baby and Id so go all  shades on the ginger one in glasses.Others posted comments too graphic for The Sun Online to publish.Last year TikTok was ordered to pay about £.million to settle accusations that it violated childrens privacy law.Campaigners have warned of the risks of young people falling prey to paedophiles on the app.Andy Burrows, NSPCC head of child safety online policy, previously told the Sun Online: Serious questions need to be asked about TikToks moderation practicesusers are able to freely post sexually suggestive comments to children.Javed Khan, chief executive of Barnardos, said: Without the right security settings, children broadcasting live video of themselves in their bedrooms over the internet could be targeted by abusers.Go private:Shut out weirdos:Restricted Mode ON:Family Safety Mode:In response, the app said safety was its top priority.A spokesperson from TikTok, which last week announced a new feature to allow parents to control what their kids view, said: We have a number of protective measures in place to reduce the opportunity for misuse and were constantly evolving our measures to further strengthen safety on TikTok. For example, we now prompt any new user under  to make their account private at set-up and again before they publish for the first time.We enable anybody - whether a TikTok user or not - to use our reportingto flag any content or account they deem inappropriate.While our protections wont catch every instance of inappropriate content, we continue to rapidly expand our content moderation teams and improve our technologies and policies so that TikTok can remain a place for positive creative expression.*Name has been changedOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is cheaper to buy, but contains moisture and when burned gives off more smoke and pollution than dry wood.It is also harder to set alight, and dficult to burn.Burning wet wood can also lead to a build-up of soot and sticky creosote inside of the burner.Dry wood has usually been dried out in a kiln and has a moisture content of % or less.If you are chopping your own wood to burn, it will need to be dried out for around a year in order to be classied as dry. Some types of wood, such as oak, will require longer.Pieces of wet wood will make a dull thud when knocked together, while you can spot dry wood by looking for cracks, a dull colour and loose bark. The logs will also feel lighter.Dry wood is not only better for the environment, but burning it gives off more heat - making it more efficient, while your stove will require less cleaning and maintenance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course public safety must trump the wellbeing of jihadis.And it’s what Brits want: the Conservatives were elected on a manesto to restore law and order to this country.Unfortunately, peers don’t have to worry about constituents. However they vote and whatever they say, we can never remove them. Which is why they can block necessary and popular legislation when it takes their fancy.Well, we’ve got news for them. The House of Lords limps on because abolishing it is not at the forefront of the public’s mind. Butpeers allow ANOTHER convicted terrorist to maim and kill on our streets, it sure will be.And then the whole sorry institution will be living on borrowed time.BULLYING and banning things is no way to turn this country green.Hiking fuel tax will make the lives of ordinary people harder. As will banning petrol cars for electric ones when there’s no adequate nationwide charging system. Phasing out wood-burning stoves is another sop to the nanny state.And because Brits are eco-conscious already, none of these moves is remotely necessary. Over a third of us have installed a smart meter to monitor energy usage, and four-fths are making an effort to save energy at home.The Government is welcome to give us tempting incentives to stay green.But bossy bans and taxes must end now.IF EU officials believe our Government will cave in to their ludicrous demands, they have another thing coming.When timid Theresa May was leading a minority Government, the EU could strongarm Britain into anything.But now the Leave campaign has been transplanted to No with a whopping mandate, the scales of power have tipped. If the EU can grasp this fact, these trade talks might prove fruitful.If not, Britain will walk out. And European politicians will be the ones to face the music at the ballot box.THREE cheers for our new blue passports. They are a welcome restoration of a powerful symbol of sovereignty.Most Brits consider themselves British, not European, citizens.So EU-issued burgundy passports always rubbed us up the wrong way.At last, a real sign that Britain is OUT.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is already clear the UK and the EU are MILES APART on how any deal would work — and moving further away from each other.Brussels insists this country signs up to stringent rules on a “level playing field” and governance before the talks can proceed. This means they want the UK to agree to stick to a bunch of EU rules even after we have left.At the same time, they want a structure where the EU’s own institutions have a key role in decidingthe UK is doing this or not.The EU view is that the UK will ultimately agree to these demands because the EU is so much bigger.One figure on the European side dismisses the idea that the UK and the EU are “sovereign equals”, pointing out that the EU has a population of million to our million.They think economic reality and the threat of long queues of lorries at Dover will lead to the UK backing down.But the Government is not going to do that. It thinks agreeing to these restrictions would destroy the whole point of Brexit: Our ability to do things dferently.Boris Johnson has been praising chief negotiator David Frost’s speech making this point as “magnicent” to anyone who’ll listen.If the EU insists on these preconditions in the opening round of negotiations, scheduled for the first week of March, the Government will dismiss the talks as pointless.Inside No, they believe Brussels does not realise how much has changed since the General Election.One source tells me: “The EU, understandably, are treating this negotiation like the previous one. But our hand is much stronger because of the mandate we’ve been given by voters.”Downing Street hopes Frost’s speech this week will make the European side realise we are serious about not accepting EU preconditions.One insider points out that Boris Johnson needn’t have an election until  — so nearly every European leader would pay the price at the ballot box before he does for any economic disruption caused by the failure of negotiations.When I asked one Secretary of State why the Government was so adamant that everything had to be settled by the end of this year, I was told: “If there are hiccups, it is better for them to happen in Year One of a government, not Year Three.”It is not just on the future relationship that the UK and EU are heading for a row.A figure close to the negotiations says they are “starting to wake up in Brussels to the fact we have a totally dferent interpretation of the Irish protocol”, which covers arrangements for the Irish border.The appointments of Suella Braverman as Attorney-General and Brandon Lewis as Northern Ireland Secretary indicates the Government is preparing to take a robust approach.This will infuriate the EU side, which believes these arrangements have already been agreed.Interestingly, influential figures on both sides hope the blow-up in trade talks comes SOONER rather than later.Why  Because they think it is only once the two sides have realised just how far apart they really are that the serious negotiations can begin.DOWNING Street is acutely aware that one of the biggest dangers to this government is LOSING VOTERS’ TRUST.If people come to see this administration as just another bunch of politicians who don’t do what they said they would, then it is doomed.No also knows that Boris Johnson’s opponents love to attack him as “untrustworthy”.This didn’t hurt him too much at the election because voters regard most politicians as untrustworthy.Butthere was a clear and compelling example of him breaking his word to voters then that could change, and very quickly.This explains why the promises made in the Tory manesto are being treated as holy writ in government.There is a serious point to Boris’s cringe-making call and response with Cabinet ministers about how they are going to hire , more police officers.He knows they need to do this to show a sceptical electorate that he keeps his promises.During the campaign, he admitted that the questions about whether he keeps his word made his “blood boil”.The whole emphasis on promise-keeping is bad news for Heathrow and the third runway.In , Boris promised to lie down in front of the bulldozers to stop it being built. Sothe bulldozers move in on his watch it will be acutely embarrassing.You can just imagine the split screen of his comments and the ground being flattened – it would dramatise the whole trust issue.This is one of the reasons why I think the third runway won’t end up happening.If in the next few weeks the Mayor of London wins his judicial review against the decision to go ahead with it, I doubt the Government will appeal the verdict.But Patel is not the first Home Secretary to have dficult relations with him.Allies of Amber Rudd believed that Rutnam should have gone when she quit over the handling of the Windrush scandal, which was as much an institutional failure as a political one.Friends of hers believe one of the reasons why the review into it has yet to be published is that it makes clear that the institutional Home Office is to blame for what went wrong.The ministers keep changing but the Home Office has not been “fit for purpose” for some time.It is proof that effective government is going to require reform of Whitehall.I understand Trump spontaneously raises the issue with social confidants, as well as figures inside his administration. He complains about the “betrayal” it represents.It isn’t just Trump who is cross. A host of Tory MPs are still pushing No to give an indication as to when the  per cent cap on Huawei involvement in the G network will be reduced to zero.The question is whether Boris will have done anything to address these concerns before he heads to the US for the G summit and a meeting with Trump in JuneThe contest hasn’t captured the public’s imagination and it has mostly served as a reminder of how in hock Labour still is to Corbynite ideology.None of the three remaining candidates is proposing the kind of break from the Corbyn years that is needed.Until it can break these shackles, Labour won’t be a national party again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson must know this is his one big chance for a bold and imaginative boost to the whole economy.As a senior minister warned on Sunday: “You don’t make the North rich by making the South poor.“Nor did the Red Wall ­collapse because those new Tory voters wanted more socialism.”Sunak’s first Budget should be the single most ­dramatic moment of the early Johnson era, setting Brexit Britain’s course as a sovereign trading nation.March , , must stand comparison with the stunning Tory Budgets of Geoffrey Howe in  and Nigel Lawson in  — both high water marks in the fortunes of post-war Britain.Otherwise, what was the point of the bombshell Cabinet shake-up that toppled Sajid Javid and sent shockwaves through our mandarin-dominated Whitehall machine Budget Day is an unrepeatable chance to show that UK plc is open for business — and begin repairing the damage inflicted by previous Chancellors.It’s no good saying Sunak had only four weeks to rewrite Javid’s tax and spending plans.What is the point of a whizz-kid with all those Goldman Sachs-charged brain cellshe can’t deliver the revolution we need This opportunity — more or less marking Boris Johnson’s first  days since the election — will not come again.If the Treasury has been doing its job, it will have drafted contingency plans for every possible challenge — tax cuts, spending leaps, higher thresholds or merging income tax with National Insurance contributions.It will have cost-and-benefit assessments for all eventualities, from a new p top rate to picking cities like Liverpool, Belfast and Glasgow as job-magnet freeports.The Treasury has a blinkered view about tax. It is a means of raising money, on a one-way ratchet.The Treasury does not do “dynamic” economics — lowering taxes and leaving voters to splash their newly acquired cash.This is where Sunak can earn his spurs as an innovative, daring, free-thinking Treasury boss. Stamp duty tops everyone’s calls for reform.George Osborne’s loathed property tax hike paralysed the housing market, locked up billions in hoarded capital, destroyed job mobility — and reduced Treasury revenues.Cutting stamp duty would instantly free up spending and boost the whole economy — especially for tradesmen and the hard-hit High Street.Speaking of shops, business rates need drastic reform to save our shuttered town centres. Why not tax the property owners instead of their struggling tenant shop-keepers All these measures would boost productivity — the amount we earn as a country for every hour worked.Ours is woeful. The average French worker produces more in four days than we do in a full week.Firms have learned to rely on cheap foreign labour, subsidised by taxpayers with welfare top-ups.Home Secretary Priti Patel’s immigration shake-up will cut the flow of cheap labour and force firms to pay proper wages for low-paid care home and service industry workers.The Chancellor can also help by reforming the Factory Tax and encouraging firms to invest in new machinery and technology — the key to economic growth.Whatever Sunak does on March , his duty is to make sure Britain is braced and ready for Brexit.Whatever he does will upset the critics. Sir Geoffrey Howe’s revolutionary  Budget was denounced by  “top” economists in The Times.In , the SNP’s Alex Salmond was booted out of the Commons for heckling Nigel Lawson’s tax-slashing measures.Together those controversial budgets cured Britain as the Sick Man Of Europe and began  years of unbroken economic growth.We need Rishi Sunak to walk in their giant footsteps and turn Britain into the offshore economic dynamo so feared by our erstwhile European partners.It has bluffed its way through the past few decadesby posturing as an integrated political and economic colossus.In reality, like the Wizard Of Oz, it has concealed its naked corruption, barefaced greed and brazen incompetence behind a curtain of bluster and denial.Britain was always there to impose reality on this world of self-delusion.

We don’t like being treated as fools.If Harry and Meghan wish to be private citizens leading a quiet le in Canada, that’s fine. But that is not their ambition.By trading on their royal associations, they aim for global influence, wealth and fame. It is a goal that makes a mockery of all their protests about their need for privacy.When the Duke and Duchess first announced in January that they wanted to “step back” from public le, there was widespread sympathy for them.Their complaints that they struggled to cope with the limelight appeared convincing, particularly given Prince Harry’s admission of his mental health problems, fuelled by the trauma of his mother’s tragic death in .But that spirit of understanding is quickly evaporating as the couple reveal the full extent of their sense of entitlement and hostility towards the palace.In response to their ening catalogue of invented grievances, many Brits will be inclined to say, “Oh give it a rest,” or “good riddance.”Patience with the couple is at an end.The last straw was their outrageous reaction to the Queen’s decision that they would no longer be allowed to use the term “Royal” in their activities.This move was absolutely correct - the royal name is central to our national heritage.It is not a franchise to be exploited for personal gain, especially by a couple who have loudly proclaimed their determination to abandon their traditional royal roles.Before their wedding in May , they were indignant when the Queen rejected Meghan’s request for the loan of a certain tiara on the big day. “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,” Prince Harry is reported to have said.But the Queen stood firm, just as she has done in the saga of the royal name.Her fully justied stance has pushed the spite and fury of the Sussexes to a new level, their anger made all the greater by the fact that they had spent thousands on their “Sussex Royal” website and merchandise.Their statements most notorious passage read, “While there is not any jurisdiction by the Monarchy or Cabinet Office over the use of the word Royal overseas, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use Sussex Royal.Who on earth do Harry and Meghan think they are to scold Her Majesty in such a patronising manner The truth is that they are talking political and constitutional nonsense.The monarch and the government certainly do have the right to restrict the use of the word “Royal” throughout the world.Its deployment is covered by a range of legislation like the Trade Marks Act and the Companies Act, as well as a host of international treaties like the  Paris Convention on Industrial Property.But on a deeper, more personal level, the Sussexes’ outburst was a profound insult to Elizabeth II as both our sovereign and a grandmother.Having given her whole le to the service of her country, she did not deserve to be treated like this.Her own example of self-sacrice during her record-breaking  years on the throne is in dramatic contrast to the self-indulgence of the Sussexes, who gave up after just  months.For all their moans about their burden, they never gave royal le as a married couple a chance.Their contempt for the palace shone through other aspects of their extraordinary statement. They wailed that other members of the royal family have been allowed to “seek employment outside the institution,” a blatant jibe at relatives like Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.But the whole point is that Meghan and Harry are not looking for normal jobs.If they were, they would not make such a fuss about their royal associations.Instead, they are hoping to cash in on their positions. That explains why the statement emphasised that Harry is “sixth-in-line to the throne.Without any hint of irony, they also boasted of their wish “to continue to represent and support Her Majesty”, when in reality they have wilfully placed the monarchy in turmoil.But for all the exhausting melodrama they have created, they still expect to be bankrolled by the taxpayer when it comes to their security, whose bill could reach £ million a year.Tellingly, they gave no indication of when they wouldthe £. million paid for the renovation of Frogmore, their property on the Windsor estate.All their laments feed into their carefully cultivated narrative of victimhood - but this is another invention.When they were first married, they were shown tremendous goodwill by the public and the media.Indeed, Kate Middleton had to put up with far more criticism when she first entered the royal family, partly because – unlike Meghan – she did not have her own successful career, and partly because of her middle-class background as the daughter of a former air hostess.“Cabin doors to manual,” snobbish courtiers allegedly sniggered behind her mother’s back.Yet through her modesty, determination, and elegance, the Duchess of Cambridge has grown into one of the monarchy’s greatest assets.“All the film people in the world, had they scoured the globe, could not have found one so suited to the part,” said Prime Minister Winston Churchill in  when the radiant Queen Elizabeth ascended to the throne. The same words could be used today about Kate now.Meanwhile, the Sussexes could be in for a shock. The world may not share their estimation of their brands appeal.Meghan herself was never a major star, while Harry has no unique talent to offer, especially now that he has become increasingly peevish and humourless. Nor is the public in either Britain or North America likely to lap up tirades about poverty and climate change delivered by a virtue-signalling, woke couple with an enthusiasm for private jet travel and a burgeoning property portfolio.The row over the royal name could just be the beginning of their troubles.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At the same time Canada is some  km away. It’s clear that the rules cannot be the same. It’s logical, it’s simple.”He added: We are ready to offer a high ambitious trade deal to the UK. But the UK cannot expect high quality access to the single marketits not prepared to accept guarantees that competition remains open and fair and free.There must be a robust level playing field.He accused the UK of putting unnecessary time constraints on the negotiations.The pressure is not being put by us. The British government is putting the pressure of time on these negotiations.Brussels and Britain only have  months left to strike a deal before the UK leaves on December , , and Boris has pledged not to extend the transition period.The EU tried to tell the UK to fall into line, and agree to to a level playing field which would require Britain to follow the rules set out by the bloc once the transition period ends.Despite saying Britain should be able to keep autonomy over trade, they laid out demands stopping the UK from setting their own tarfs or charges on goods coming into the country for the Union.French EU Minister Amelie de Montchaline said France would not accept any trade deal where the UK doesnt follow EU rules.She said this morning: The UK is a sovereign country... but when products leave the UK and want to enter the EU, its up to us to decide.The UKs proposals for trade talks have been signed off in Cabinet but wont be published until Thursday.The mandate from the EU also demanded access to the UK fishing waters - a position the PM is unlikely to consider.Eurocrats insisted fisherman from member states should still be allowed to fish in British waters even after the transition period.They said the UK should uphold continued reciprocal access to avoid economic dislocation.The PM has already slapped them down over the hated Common Fisheries Policy which Brexiteers are determined to scrap it.Boris spokesman said: TheCommittee has just approved the UKs negotiating mandate. It was a very smooth process to agree our approach which will restore our economic and political independence.The UKs primary objective in the negotiations is to ensure that we restore our economic and political independence on January  .The PMs promise to leave the single market and customs unions would be scuppered by the EUs attempts to enforce the level playing field.Boris has said repeatedly the UK would not be a rule taker in the future relationship.Trade: The UK should fall into line, keep tarrfs of European goods and follow EU regulations on food standardsCourts: European courts would still have some say over the decisions made by British courtsThe bloc is also trying to make Britain follow their standards on issues such as chlorinated chicken - a potential flash point for a trade deal between the US and the UK.Boris has said he will hold discussions for a US-UK trade deal at the same time as he thrashes out an agreement with the EU.The PM will be careful not to put a deal with the US in jeopardy by signing up to restrictive EU measures.The EU has also tried to tell Britain it should follow standards dictated by the bloc on issues such as state aid, workers rights, environment.Brussels also told the UK they would need to hand power to the EU Court of Justice and away from the British courts.It threatened to halt cooperation on criminal law enforcementthe UK refused to abide by the European Convention of Human Rights.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA bullied black benefits officer who lasted only five weeks in her job has won a race discrimination payout of almost £, from the Department for Work and Pensions. Anne Giwa-Amu, , suffered a “hostile environment” where staff set out to humiliate her by using racist language like aposP***-loverapos in her presence, the tribunal heard.Ms Giwa-Amu, who is mixed Nigerian and Welsh, endured one DWP official boasting that he had “touched her bum”, the hearing was told.Colleagues at the DWP branch in Caerphilly also repeatedly accused Ms Giwa-Amu of stealing ice cream and used body-spray on themselves while sitting next to her. A  at Cardf employment tribunal awarded Ms Giwa-Amu £, for race and age discrimination. Her compensation included £, for loss of future earnings and £, for injury to feelings, one of the highest ever awards of its kind for harassment. Judge Laura Howden-Evans ruled that Daisy Cartwright and Robert Lewis acted “in an insulting way deliberately intended to humiliate Ms Giwa-Amu and create a hostile environment for her”. Speaking afterwards, Ms Giwa-Amu complained that the pair had not been disciplined and accused the department of promoting a culture of racism. She said: “I am relieved by the tribunal award. The last three years have been a nightmare. “But the employees who were openly hostile towards me because of my colour an age have not been penalised. “They have got away scot-free and in some cases have even been promoted. “When I went to management, they sided with the employees, which created an unbearable situation. “These people assess benefits claims for ethnic minority claimants, which is a very worrying situation. “They have all had ersity training but it has had no impact on them because their racism is ingrained.  “Management is paying lip service to the equality legislation. By protecting offenders, the department is promoting a culture of racism. “The institution has now been held accountable and will pay my award but the employment tribunal should be given more powers so the perpetrators can be penalised too.” Ms Giwa-Amu, of Caerphilly, was born in Wales but has a Nigerian father and grew up there. She had previously iously worked as a CPS case worker, solicitor and oil company director and the tribunal found she was a very capable lady. She joined DWP as an admin officer in February  after an unsuccessful attempt to start a small business. She was the only non-white recruit of nine new trainees and the only one aged over , the tribunal heard. Within five weeks, she made a formal complaint of bullying and racial harassment and was signed off work sick suffering from stress and anxiety. In her first week, Ms Cartwright violated Ms Giwa-Amuaposs dignity by using racist language such as aposP***-loverapos in her presence, the tribunal found. Ms Cartwright also mocked her for complaining that “it always rains in Wales”, telling Ms Giwa-Amu that her “weather report” was racist. Ms Cartwright repeatedly accused Ms Giwa-Amu of stealing ice cream and ignored her request to stop spraying herself and spinning on her chair while sat alongside her.  Mr Lewis, meanwhile, humiliated her by loudly telling the group “I touched her bum. I touched her bum”. Ms Giwa-Amu went on sick leave from her £,-a-year post in  and was unlawfully dismissed in October that year for being unable toto work, the tribunal ruled. It found that without the discrimination, she would have been promoted to the £, role of executive officer the next year and worked in the civil service until her retirement. Instead, Ms Giwa-Amu, who has been unemployed ever since, ran out of money for food after her final pay cheque was withheld. The tribunal noted that despite her best efforts to find a fresh job, Ms Giwa-Amu had received only one invitation to interview. It concluded that at her age, she is over-qualied for many jobs and unlikely ever to work again. The DWP has been ordered to contact the Equality and Human Rights Commission for ersity awareness training and its permanent secretary, Peter Schofield, must directly review her case.

But Jon Ransom, , Glen Bennett, , Frank Walling, , and Keith Plummer, , have now been jailed for more than  years in total. Speaking after the case at Truro Crown Court, Detective Inspector Glenn Willcocks, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: The vessel was in a poor state, smelling strongly of diesel and cluttered with clothing and empty food wrappings. The boat would have been extremely cramped with all  people having to share a single toilet. The four convicted today risked the lives of  men, women and children without any appreciation of the danger of their circumstances. They were motivated only by monetary reward and thankfully no one paid the ultimate price.  Several members of the public saw the group of people getting off a boat at Newlyn Harbour, Cornwall, on April  last year. CCTV footage reviewed the van, followed by another car, and police stopped both vehicles on the M near Cullompton, Devon. The van door was opened and officers found  Vietnamese nationals inside, including women and children.They were taken to a multi-agency reception centre and referred to the Home Office and social care services to be managed, Devon and Cornwall Police said. The men were arrested but initially denied any wrongdoing. However, Judge Robert Linford, sentencing the men, said they were motivated by profit and traded in human misery with the victims carted around like freight.  It is believed that the  victims boarded the yacht, which was called the Johan Sebastian and owned by Walling, in Roscoff, France.

Afterwards, he felt that it was a bit weird and that she did not say anything to him afterwards. The boy had been the first person who Cordice told that she was pregnant, the jury of seven men and five women heard. She had shown him an app on her phone which suggested the date she had conceived was the first time they had had sex, the court was told.  While they carried on having sex, Cordice had married her long-term partner and had given birth to her child. In a police interview video shown to the jury, the boy complainant told of how Cordiceaposs husband had found out about her relationship with him. The boy told investigators: Her boyfriend found out. He did not really say anything. He got angry at first. He started shouting at me. Then he did not really say anything to me. She spoke about him to me sometimes, just how he had been annoying her, accusing her of stuff. The prosecutor told how Cordice had been forced into taking a DNA test which showed that the -year-old boy was her babyaposs real father after social services became involved once the boyaposs mother called in the police. At that point she had begun studying at a child care course and had been working in a childrenaposs nursery. Police arrested Cordice at her home in Windsor, Berkshire on July ,  and she was later interviewed under caution. The jury heard she had provided a prepared statement, saying: I deny any sexual contact with the complainant. He has always had a crush on me and would always make inappropriate remarks and do inappropriate things such as grab me and annoy me. We did not have sexual contact. Despite DNA evidence to the contrary, she insisted: The complainant is not the father of my child.  Since her first police interview, the DNA test was carried out which the prosecution said meant it was  million times more likely than not that the -year-old boy was the father of Cordiceaposs child. Cordice, appearing in the dock at Reading Crown Court wearing a grey jacket with a furry lapel, was expected to claim that the young boy had raped her, the jury was told. However, Ms Ong told the jury: It may come as a surprise to you that she, Ms Cordice, now accepts that there was sexual activity between her and the boy. What she may say is that she was raped by the boy. The prosecutionaposs case is that there was no such thing but these iniduals agreed to have sexual intercourse with one another. The prosecutionaposs case is that this claim of rape is a lie, it is an attempt to make the complainant go down in your estimation of him. Her assertion that she still believes that the boy is not her childaposs father, the prosecution will say, is patently untrue.

I arrived at Polo Bar and selected the Royale Stack of pancakes for my challenge, each layer of which was laden with vanilla cream, a mixture of berries and raspberry coulis.The pancakes were flipped, stacked high and brought over to my table and even though I knew what I had been letting myself in for, my mouth still dropped when the tower was placed in front of me.Considering I was known to struggle finishing a regular serving of pancakes, I suddenly wasnapost feeling very good about my chances. But I had come all this way and I was going to give it a shot.  Pulling the first two pancakes off the stack, I got stuck in and managed to get through them no problem. These taste great, I gleefully told the chef, who was watching while I ate. But my joy went away when I hit the third pancake, as the sweetened cream started to get a bit much. By the fourth one I was feeling incredibly full but was determined to keep going. Now, let it be known that at this point, I was convinced the tower consisted of  pancakes - not . Thataposs because Polo Baraposs menu features a dferent  challenge you can do every other day of the year, not just on Shrove Tuesday, and thataposs what I thought I was doing. So when I made it to the fth one, despite feeling like I was about to throw up, I was pretty proud of myself - Iaposd made it half way! My time was almost up as I forced a few more mouthfuls of the fth pancake in, so I turned to my colleague and told her I was going to stop after this one and Iaposd settle for eating half of the whole thing. She looked at me asIaposd suddenly grown a second head.  You still have one more to get half way, she told me. There are  pancakes. WAIT, WHAT ! I pointed incredulously at the menu, which stated the challenge featured , but she shook her head. This wasnapost the regular challenge, she reminded me, this was the Pancake Day challenge and there were definitely  pancakes on my plate. I did a quick re-count. Damn! I was desperate to get to that middle mark, but there was no way I was going to be able to face another one, the mere sight of what I had left was making my stomach churn and I had to get on the tube after this. Not ideal. Oh well, I thought. At least Iaposd tried.

Guests at the four-star H Costa Adeje Palace in the south west of the island have been sent a letter saying the hotel is closed down and they must remain in their rooms until further notice. Brit holidaymaker Hannah Green, , said she woke up to find a note slipped under her hotel room telling her not to leave the room. She claims reception wouldnapost give her any further information - so she resorted to Google where she learned that a man at the hotel had tested positive for the deadly bug. Ms Green, from Hertfordshire, said she is having a holiday from hell. She arrived at the hotel on Saturday with her boyfriend, Court Amys, and their one-year-old son. They are supposed to be staying until Sunday.Ms Green told the PA news agency that communication had been non-existent, adding: We woke up to a note under our door this morning saying that for health reasons not to leave our room. I called downstairs to reception as soon as I saw it and they wouldnapost tell us anything. So I quickly got on my phone and googled and saw a man had tested positive for coronavirus so I basically assumed it was that. But since then, weaposve had nothing from the hotel - no one has told us anything or whataposs going to happen. Ms Green said she booked her holiday with Tui, adding: Iaposve called them as well and they havenapost really said much either. They were just going on what the hotelaposs been telling them, basically, and the hotel wouldnapost tell them anything either. People are moving around the hotel but weaposre not. Weaposre in our room with the baby. Weaposre worried for the baby.  Ms Green said she would like to go home but added: I donapost think weaposll be allowed to leave. We donapost want to be here. Weaposre fed up now. She said a sandstorm at the weekend had also confined them to their rooms. The sandstorm was the day after we arrived, Sunday, so we had to stay in the hotel then, she said. Holiday from hell, honestly. She said the couple were amusing themselves by watching TV and films on their laptop.  The H Costa Adeje Palace is a seafront hotel with nearly  rooms, four pools and a gym. Another couple, David Hoon, , and Pamela Scott, , from Matlock, Derbyshire, who also travelled with Tui, told the MailOnline they were surviving on meagre snacks. Mr Hoon said: Nobody is telling us whataposs going on, how long this is going to last and who is going to feed us. The way this has been handled is a disgrace. The hotel is like a ghost house and my fear is that by trapping us inside it, we stand more chance of catching the coronavirus. This whole thing is very worrying.  Fellow British tourist Christopher Betts said guests had been allowed to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant on Tuesday morning but were otherwise told to stay in their rooms. Travel firms Tui and Jetholidays are among those who use use the hotel for package holidays, with Tui having around  guests there from dferent countries, including a small number from the UK. A spokeswoman for Tui UK said it was aware of a case of Covid- at the hotel. She added: We can confirm that Tui has around  customers in the resort from dferent countries. Tui representatives on Tenere are present on site and will liaise with our customers. All guests have been asked to remain in their rooms and are being looked after by the hotel. Our holiday programme to Tenere continues to operate as planned for all other hotels.  A spokesman for Jet said: We are aware of reports that a non-Jetholidays customer staying at the H Costa Adeje Palace in Tenere has tested positive for coronavirus. Under the advice of the regional and the Spanish government authorities, the hotel has been placed under quarantine. A statement from the hotel said it has implemented all health and operational recommendations from the health authorities to ensure the safety and wellbeing of customers and employees. Additionally, we are providing customers and hotel staff all the necessary care and attention so that, despite the inconveniences this situation may cause, they are taken care of in the best way possible. It comes as travellers ing to the UK from northern Italy were told they may need to self-isolate as part of measures to stop the spread of the Covid- disease caused by coronavirus. Symptoms of Covid- include a cough, fever and shortness of breath. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said official advice has been changed to say that those who have been to anywhere in Italy north of Pisa should self-isolatethey develop flu-like symptoms on theirto the UK. Britons who have been in locked down regions of Italy - including Lombardy and Veneto - should self-isolate at home for  days eventhey have no symptoms. The advice comes as the Department of Health added Iran, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Burma and parts of northern Italy to the list of places where travellers need to follow clinical advice. In Italy,  people have tested positive for coronavirus and seven have died.

It comes after pupils took part in half term trips to northern Italy, where the high number of cases have led to  towns in Lombardy and the Veneto being put in lockdown. Independent Cransley School in Northwich and nearby Nearby Brine Leas Academy in Northwich , Cheshire, are among those to shut their doors, after some students developed flu-like symptoms following ski trips to the region.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

Indeed, the suggestion has been made that any opinions counter to the management view have been distinctly unwelcome.Nobody is suggesting that Knapdale Ward is perfect, and common sense tells us that dementia patients are more comfortable and relaxed in their home environment. An enhanced community care model is an excellent idea # but healthcare professionals are adamant that Knapdale Ward should be retained, with improvements made in discussion with staff.It is needed, they say, as an option within Argyll when the home environment is no longer suitable for dementia sufferers, their families and carers.Serious questions need to be answered.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held against the backdrop of a cut to our capital budget this year of  percent.\""},{"url":null,"title":"former-melrose-winger-backs-murrayfield-abseil","story":"A SUPERHERO abseil down the Murrayfield

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength. She bade her time there, kenning she would be able taeand reclaim her throne when darkness once again ed tae the land.ldquoIn autumn, said one of the children.ldquoAye, smiled the gran.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why we hae arsquo these winds and storms just noo.

consultation had found tenants ldquooverwhelmingly endorsed the rise, which is the same as last yearrsquos increase.And he pointed out the gulf between council rent and private rent in the county.He said: ldquoIt is in housing costs in East Lothian we observe the greatest level of inequality.ldquoWhilst we have amongst the lowest average council house rents in Scotland, our private sector rents

before, with over poundmillion being invested in providing new council housing and nearly poundmillion being invested in modernisation of our existing stock through our new bathroom and kitchen

There are even stronger contenders for criticism, high among them the prime ministerrsquos consigliore, Dominic Cummings. Barely a day passes without an image of him scurrying past snappers in a symphony of greys and blacks, from beanie hat and tee-shirt, or creased, untucked shirt and low-slung jeans. Occasionally there is a flash of bright cashmere, accessorised with a plastic carrier bag.Long before Cummings advertised for weirdos and misfits to join him in Downing Street he had set a low dress-code bar, the sort intended ndash because it cannot be an accident ndash to convey disdain for conventional attire and standards. Such abject lack of stylishness might be acceptable in Silicon Valley or Deliveroo, but the message it sends is dismal. It also hints at menace, the attire of a dangerous lone wolf.

When Columbo shrugged on his working unorm of ill-kempt Mac, he wanted suspects to think he was dim and harmless. They saw scruffy, and presumed stupid.

In this, as in so many realms, men have got away lightly down the years. Perhaps that exemption should end.Itrsquos not that I care much what anyone wears. As a journalist, I learned to note down immediately what interviewees were wearing, otherwise later Irsquod completely forget. Nor have I ever been chic.

A wedding guest who was told recently to remove his tie before he could attend the ceremony because ties are uncool, should have turned on his polished Oxford heel and left. Making a sartorial effort is a tangible way of expressing respect, not merely for yourself but for others. Emulating the kids, or pretending that casual clothes make no dference to your performance or the impression you make, is an older manrsquos delusion.

But beyond the emotional debris and layers of machismo protecting him, McLean was a fragile construction likely to crumble before the final whistle blew.All this is brought home magnicently in Philip Dferrsquos dramatic love letter to McLean, which moves between the blustering rage of his subjectrsquos public persona and the doubt-fuelled self-flagellation of the private man. This is made flesh in Sally Reidrsquos production by a wonderful Barrie Hunter, who captures McLeanrsquos vulnerability with a lightness that canrsquot help but endear him even to those who loved to hate this most pugnacious of characters.With Hunter pacing urgently across the expanse of Kenny Millerrsquos symbolic building site set to the buzz of Fiona Johnstonrsquos soundscape, he is accompanied by Chris Alexanderrsquos Jimmy. This track-suited foil marks the touchlines of McLeanrsquos le, prompting, pushing and cajoling like some good angel manager in waiting.Over the showrsquos hour-long duration, Dfer teases the devoted with a few key anecdotes that define McLean, but goes for the man rather than the ball in exposing all the complexities of a working class Lanarkshire kid thrust into the spotlight.Beyond McLean, Dfer has penned a much bigger elegy to the breed of back-street mavericks such as McLean and other managers of his generation who had a near holy devotion to a sport yet to be overtaken by those obsessed with money more than football. Out of this comes a human portrait of a flawed genius, delivered with a warts and all mixture of brutality and tenderness that makes the game beautul once more."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11068414.jpg?type=article-full","title":"luss-locals-put-signs-deter-tourist-traffic","story":"The village of Luss on Loch Lomondside has become a major tourist attraction visited by more than , people every year, but residents have long called for tourist vehicles to be banned from their streets, saying they cause traffic jams and pose a danger to pedestrians.Camleys cartoon: Residents angry over tourist traffic.Now frustrated locals have erected their own road signs asking motorists to refrain from parking in the village after losing faith in the \"incompetent and unaccountable\" officials from Argyll and Bute Council to act on their concerns.Campaigners say they have been waiting for years for the local authority to agree to impose restrictions on the huge number of cars that jam their picturesque streets every tourist season, but have now lost all confidence.They are threatening a campaign of lsquodirect actionrsquo, starting with the erection of five eight-foot signs asking motorists to refrain from parking in the village.Peter Robertson, vice convenor of Luss and Arden Community Council, said: \"People are at their witsrsquo end and have now resorted to putting up their own road signs because the council has failed to act.:Calls for barrier to shut out tourists cars from Luss\"This has been on the agenda for many years.

I imagine the team of BBC Scotlandrsquos The Nine do the same when the new edition of Radio Times arrives.One reason for the news programmersquos pitully low, several men and a dog audience numbers, is the sheer strength of the peak time offerings on the main channels.Last night, for example, viewers could have chosen from a new series of MasterChef at pm, the police procedural documentary Murder  , or Flesh and Blood, ITVrsquos latest star-spangled whodunnit set over four nights.Written by Sarah Williams , Flesh and Blood began with a figure on a stretcher and a tease. The unidentied inidual was taken from a storm-lashed beach at night and loaded into an ambulance as a woman, in voiceover, set the scene.ldquoIrsquove known the family for years. I watched the children grow up, and I can honestly say theyrsquove been the perfect neighbours hellip Theyrsquove had their ups and downs. Who hasnrsquot  But I never, ever dreamt it would end like this.Who could resist such an opening, particularly when the narrator - reliable or unreliable  - is Imelda Staunton, playing Mary, the next door neighbour to the perfect family we suspect, and hope, are not so ideal after all.With its beside the Sussex seaside setting and intriguing opening, the ITV thriller has drawn comparisons with Big Little Lies, the Reece Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman-led Golden Globes winner. But Flesh and Blood is more grubby old Blighty in its concerns - nosy neighbour, arguments over money - than Calornia glossy, and it does not take itself too seriously.The plot is that old standby, recently widowed mum takes up with a new man, much to the suspicion of her adult children who worry about her - and their inheritance. It has been more than  months since Vivienlost her husband, and now she is introducing her boyfriend Markto children Jake, Helen and Natalie .Mark, being a retired surgeon, seems like quite the catch initially. Which woman wouldnrsquot want a man who, at a pinch, could perform an appendectomy on the kitchen table He is loving, romantic, attentive, whisking Vivien off to France for a surprise lunch in a private plane. But is he too good to be true Vivienrsquos children are not quite what they seem either, each having their share of secrets and enemies. Then there is singleton Mary next door, an eager little mouse who is always ready to take in a parcel or whip up a batch of cheese straws for Vivienshe is having the family around. Clearly suspicious.The cut where the camera moves from Mary telling the police that she likes to keep herself to herself, to her steaming open a parcel for next door, was wickedly good. Even better was the follow-up.Like Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window, Mary has a set of binoculars and they are not used for bird-watching. Between this, the sweeping orchestral score and the sunny setting in which dark events may or may not be taking place, there is an air of faux Hitchcock with slyly comic undertones about Flesh and Blood.

Over that time, the SNP has conformed to all the ills that beset political parties in office for y periods. Itrsquos got sloppy, fractious, and stupid. But unlike other political parties, itrsquos protected from the consequences by its super-weapon: the get out of jail free card its base of supporters lend it because of independence.Itrsquos like the Trump Effect. Donald Trump once said: \"They say I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that  Where I could stand in the middle of Fth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldnrsquot lose any voters, okay  Itrsquos like incredible.Wersquove seen with Trump that he can do or say anything and his base doesnrsquot flinch. The same was true of Boris Johnson and Brexiteers. The same is true of the SNP and its base ndash because it wears independence like a shield.The problem is, though, therersquos no shield for Scotland or the Scottish people when it comes to bad government by the SNP.Education is a mess. Teachers are at the end of their tether, and results are atrocious. Pass rates for Higher English last year saw a drop of .% compared to  ndash thatrsquos  fewer pupils passing. Advanced Higher English pass rates dropped by .%.The pass rate for Higher History fell from .% to .%. Higher Modern Studies was down by .%. In Maths, the pass rate fell by .%.To make matters much worse, the Government was accused of trying to sneak these bad figures out by releasing them at night. It looked low and crafty.:MacAskill says tells SNP to focus on lsquogrunt workrsquo not marchingWhile education soaks up most of the negative headlines, therersquos also serious problems with policing and hospitals.There was a time ndash maybe five or six years ago, before the world went mad with identity disorder ndash when nearly all voters judged governments on how effective they were in office. Today, thatrsquos not the case for many voters.What matters to many is whether a political party reflects their sense of identity. This becomes a force field of protection, a magical cloak of invincibility. As long as a party reaffirms the identity of their base ndash be that via Brexit or independence ndash it will avoid the kind of supporter dissatisfaction which would end other governments.This creates a huge distortion in public debate ndash the essential cornerstone of democracy.Yet despite having this super-weapon in its possession, the power of identity as political protection, the SNP is now absurdly starting to juggle with live grenades.Itrsquos splitting rapidly on the best path towards independence. Some would like to see Sturgeon go. Independence, which until now has conferred protection, is beginning to damage the party from within.The isions in the party have crystallised in the Holyrood constituency of Edinburgh Central - Ruth Davidsonrsquos old stomping ground. Two big SNP names are jockeying for a place on the ballot - Joanna Cherry and Angus Robertson.The pair represent the two sides of the party split. Cherry is on whatrsquos been called the Salmond side, and Robertson is on the Sturgeon wing. In the crudest of terms, itrsquos the more populist branch versus the social democrat side of the party.:Analysis: Does Derek Mackay scandal mark the beginning of the end for the SNP Therersquos already mutterings of Cherry replacing Sturgeon as party leader. Of course, this isnrsquot the only split in the party. The SNP is also tearing itself apart over the increasingly toxic debate about trans rights.Letrsquos not forget that the SNP has also just gone through the Derek Mackay scandal, and itrsquos still got to weather the fall-out from the coming Alex Salmond trial.So internally, things look pretty awful for the SNP, but in terms of electoral performance and opinion polls the party is laughing hellip for now.Moving against Sturgeon would change the game for the party. Sturgeon has centre-ground appeal. Plenty of Unionist and No voters hate her, but to many people, shersquos seen as professional, decent, intelligent, and with her heart in the right place.Her rivals come across as isive, angry and slippery. The party wouldnrsquot lose its force field of identity, its shield,it lost Sturgeon ndash the base would still be there ndash but it would damage its centre-ground appeal.Of course, Sturgeon is to blame for a lot of this herself. Shersquos teased the base with independence for years in order to keep power. Now her more headstrong and ill-considered colleagues want to get on with it come what may.A grubby political assassination of Sturgeon would be the beginning of the end for the SNP, and that would inevitably mean the beginning of the end of the campaign for independence. The SNP must step very carefully, unless it wants to succumb to political gravity, dragging the dreams of its voters down with it.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-music-tuition-vital-education-scottish-government-got-fund","story":"The report, ominously titled A Note of Concern, had been commissioned after large numbers of children started dropping out of music lessons, with the growing practice of charging for a musical education resulting in many families being priced out. This was of concern to the committee given the pivotal role music has been proven to play in pupil attainment as well as the positive impact learning an instrument and playing in an ensemble has been shown to have.As committee convener Clare Adamson, the SNP MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw, said at the time: ldquoThere is little doubt about the positive benefits that music can have on us as iniduals, as communities and indeed to the wider Scottish culture and economy.Yet here we are a year later and Edinburgh City Council has just waved through a plan that will see pound, slashed from its music budget between next year and  while yesterday councillors in North Lanarkshire sat down and actually ndash unbelievably ndash discussed the prospect of scrapping the arearsquos music service completely. Representatives in Dumfries and Galloway, who have already faced the wrath of incredulous parents at a series of budget roadshows, will have that very same discussion when they meet on Thursday.They should all be thoroughly ashamed. Take Edinburgh. Though a consultation is to be carried out before any changes are made, the fact that half a million poundsrsquo worth of savings has to be made in the instrumental music service means something is going to have to give. Teacher numbers and instrument choice will almost certainly be cut, while it is all but unavoidable that some kind of charging for lessons will be introduced.The impact that cuts of any kind will have is obvious, with fewer teachers giving lessons in fewer instruments inevitably meaning fewer opportunities to learn. Meanwhile, evidence gathered over the past few years shows that, regardless of any concessions that might be introduced, the introduction of fees will lead to certain children no longer being able to learn. Yes, those with wealthy enough parents will be able to pay or go private and, yes, those from poorer backgrounds will not have to pay at all, but for those in the middle ndash those whose parents are in work but who have no cash to spare ndash their musical future looks bleak. In a country where every child is supposed to have the right to a broad and deep education, that is an unforgivable dereliction of duty.That would be bad enough at the best of times, and the postcode lottery that sees children in Glasgow pay nothing to learn an instrument while their counterparts in Clackmannanshire must pay pound shows just how much some children are already being let down. But in a city that each year becomes a festival-hosting cultural hotspot that puts the whole of Scotland on the global stage that has worked hard to ensure those from its poorest areas are given the most opportunities to attend those festivals and that last year sought in spectacular style to break down some of the perceived barriers to musical attainment by transforming Heart of Midlothianrsquos football ground into a concert arena for the world-famous LA Phil, Edinburgh City Councilrsquos decision is nothing short of perverse.What, after all, is the point in being a world-famous patron of the artsthat doesnrsquot extend to every one of your own schoolchildren  Does Edinburgh really want its future contribution to be a trust-fund backed one Yet while the actions of inidual authorities may be reprehensible, they are only getting away with making these decisions because the Scottish Government ndash the same government that continually talks about the benefits that learning an instrument can bring ndash does not class instrumental tuition as core to the curriculum. That means it doesnrsquot provide specic funding for music lessons, which in turn means that no matter how many times ministers say councils should be providing the service free of charge ndash which is often ndash they are under no obligation to do so.It is hardly surprising, given the never-ending cuts councils have been forced to make, that every bit of discretionary spend has become fair-game at budget-setting time. Yet there is something particularly distasteful about making children shoulder the burden of any of these cuts and something especially fishy about gunning for music at this particular point.Only last week a Scottish Government report revealed that the number of children gaining Highers in core subjects dropped by as much as  per cent in the last academic year while the attainment gap between rich and poor has continued to widen. What better time for three local authorities in which the SNPrsquos influence is weak to highlight a major inconsistency in the Governmentrsquos approach to education And there is something deeply inconsistent in the Government saying on the one hand that music is so central to wellbeing and attainment that is must be provided free while on the other sending councils the message that it is up to them to decide whether to provide it. Yes, it is expensive to provide one-to-one or small-group tuition to children outside a classroom setting and, yes, there are very many demands on government funds. But , as has been proven, that improves childrenrsquos concentration, collegiality and attainment across the board ndash something that will have an impact across their entire lives ndash surely it has got to be seen as money well spent As things stand too many of the children our education system proclaims to cherish are being used as political footballs while a group of teachers who have dedicated their lives to nurturing talent regardless of where it is found remain in the firing line. The only way to end this is for the Government to prove it believes music is as vital to a childrsquos education as maths or English by ringfencing the funding to provide it. It is not just the future of our children that depends on it, but the future of our culture and society too."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-weather-temperatures-set-drop-minus-10c-tuesday-night","story":"The Met Office said cm to cm of snow is expected to fall over Scotland by Tuesday morning, while higher areas in Northern Ireland and northern England could see up to cm.A yellow weather alert remains in place for those areas until am, warning of ice and potentially hazardous travel.:Scotlands weather: After the gusts and floods...the Monday snow warningLast night, the mercury dropped to minus .C at the Cairnwell in the Scottish Highlands.Signicant snow falls were also recorded overnight, with Aviemore in Scotland recording cm and Northern Irelandrsquos Lough Fea getting cm.Tuesdays morning rush hour will bring bright spells and blustery showers with the possibility of #ice, #sleet, and #snow pic UHNXAroLmdash Met OfficeFebruary , Two severe ldquodanger to le flood warnings have been issued by the Environment Agency for the Shropshire towns of Shrewsbury and Ironbridge, along the River Severn.A further  flood warnings ndash where flooding is expected ndash and  flood alerts ndash where flooding is possible ndash were in place across England on Monday night.Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said temperatures are expected to drop down to minus C across central and eastern Scotland overnight.The west of the country ndash mainly in areas above  metres ndash is expected to see the worst of the snow.The Met Office has warned drivers of blustery showers, with the possibility of ice, sleet and snow during rush hour.Later in the day, the mercury is forecast to rise to C, with the South East experiencing the warmest temperatures.Showers are expected for much of the UK throughout Tuesday, along with gusts of mph to mph on the South West coast.Further inland, wind speeds are forecast to drop to mph to mph.In Scotland, temperatures are forecast to drop to lows of minus C during the night.ldquoAny showers that fall could be a mix of rain, sleet and snow, Mr Partridge said. ldquoWe are quite likely to see another ice warning on Tuesday night.He said Wednesday is forecast to be another mix of scattered showers and sunshine.He added: ldquoAs low pressure moves away, we have high pressure in the South West of the UK, and the combination of the two is bringing in more northwesterlyair from Greenland."},{"url":null,"title":"ian-murray-labour-must-win-back-scotland-chance-government","story":"Ian Murray, MP for Edinburgh South, made the remarks after being endorsed by two former Prime Minsters, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, this morning.Mr Murray, who is competing against favourite Angela Rayner, as well as Dawn Butler, Richard Burgon and Rosena Allin-Khan, said a Scot should be put in a senior role within the party leadership to \"show all the nations and regions of the UK that they matter.\"He said: \"Irsquom proud to have the endorsement of both of Labourrsquos living Prime Ministers ndash Tony Blair and Gordon Brown ndash and the we of Labourrsquos greatest Prime Minister that never was.\"Without winning back Scotland, they could be the last Labour Prime Ministers.\"Mr Murray said the \"Corbyn experiment has not worked\" and said the party needed \"fundamental change\" in order to regain ground in the polls.He said: \"Were using these deputy leaderships as a staging ground to try to try and get the Labour party back into government.\"Thats where we need to be.

As much of the construction will be built off site during the winter months, ready for assembly during Spring and Summer .Mr Byrne said: ldquoItrsquos an extremely harsh climate where the building is situated and even when we get to the island therersquos a challenge in delivery methods. The island itself is almost designing the building and the whole purpose is to view the island.ldquoItrsquos challenging but itrsquos not something we deal with every day."},{"url":null,"title":"have your say on future of library services","story":"A series of open public engagement events will be held in libraries throughout Aberdeenshire next week.The informal drop-in sessions will give people the chance to find out more about Live Le Aberdeenshire’s plans for developing libraries, and the opportunity to share their opinions and ideas about future services.An online survey seeking views on future library provision runs until the end of the month and has already attracted more than , responses.The open sessions in communities are intended to complement this survey, seeking the opinions of those who use – or don’t yet use – their local library.Knowledgeable staff will be on hand in each venue to talk through planned changes and improvements, with a wealth of information about the ways in which libraries fit into community le at the moment.Modern libraries aim to be at the heart of their community - a safe and neutral space to browse, learn and meet people.Take this opportunity to shape your local library service over a cup of tea and a chat.Public engagement events:Ellon Library: Tuesday, February  - am to pm.Inverurie Library: Thursday, February  - am to pm.Kemnay Community Cafe, Kemnay Hall: Friday, February  - .am to .am.Kintore Library: Monday, February  - .pm to pm.Meldrum Library: Tuesday, February  - pm to pm.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

That’s why it is right that we have a strong regulator to ensure social media firms fulfil their vital responsibility to vulnerable users.”The news was welcomed by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which started campaigning for better regulation of internet sites two years ago.In  , Police Scotland recorded  crimes of communicating indecently with a child, which included online sexual communication. And the number of recorded crimes increased by  per cent from the previous year.Through its Wild West Web campaign, the NSPCC has been at the forefront of campaigning for better protection for children online since .Last summer, the charity revealed that one in  young people in the UK, aged from  to  years old, who used Facebook or Facebook Messenger had sent, received or been asked to send sexual content to an adult.And with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg planning to allow encrypted messages, which he admitted would protect “the privacy of people doing bad things”, the NSPCC hopes the government will act quickly.Peter Wanless, chief executive officer, said: “The government has signalled it is willing to stand up to Silicon Valley and commit to landmark British regulation that could set a global standard in protecting children online.“For far too long the safety of children has been an inconvenience for social media companies who have left them exposed to harmful content, grooming and abuse. “Tech giants will only do all that they should to stop groomers abusing children on their sitesthe penalties for failure are game-changing.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.cumbernauld-news webimage ..!

Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief executive, said: “Facebook may be happy to shut its eyes to abuse but it can’t close its ears to the unanimous concern shown by international experts.“Mark Zuckerberg has a choice whether to allow sexual abuse to soar on his sites or listen to those from all over the world asking him to rethink how to implement encryption without putting children at risk.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils urged to be safe and seen when cycling","story":"Pupils who cycle to and from school across Aberdeenshire are being reminded they need to be safe and be seen during the winter months.Although it may be starting to become a little brighter in the mornings and afternoon daylight is lasting that bit longer, Aberdeenshire Council is encouraging both children and their parents to remain focused on safety at all times.There have been some reports of youngsters riding to school without appropriate lights or even cycle helmets which has given real cause for concern.It is illegal not to have lights on your bikecycling in the hours of darkness and there is no specic time set each day as the surroundings play a large part in light levels.As soon as the sun has set, cyclists need to ensure they remain visible with lights as well as reflectors.In order to ensure pupils can continue to enjoy their healthy ride to school, the council is urging parents to make children as visible as possible in these low light conditions.Councillor Gillian Owen, Chair of Aberdeenshire Council’s Education and Children’s Services Committee, said: “We must stress that when riding at night, the law states you must always use a working white front light and red backlight, plus a red rear reflector.“Sadly, we have heard of instances when pupils have been attending school – some on new bikes they received at Christmas – without the appropriate lights. Similarly, some children are also cycling without a helmet and I would urge parents to ensure their children are suitably equipped to go out cycling safely.”Committee vice-chair Councillor Rosemary Bruce added: “Aberdeenshire schools are great supporters of the Bikeability scheme which provides training and advice for both the pupils and their families.

OIC has also said all profit would stay in the islands and be used to aid in preserving and enhancing key services as well as providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.OIC claims the wind farm projects would also allow the council to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Planning applications for the Hoy and Faray projects are likely to follow in Summer and Autumn respectively, due to additional survey requirements for these sites. Public consultation events will be held shortly in these areas to present the latest plans and gather public views.All three developments are substantial, and the turbines are of a height not used in Orkney before, being .m tall at blade tip. The council says it recognises that the projects present a number of potential impacts and these must be weighed against the project#s potential benefits. Iniduals will have dferent opinions on that balance and through the planning process have the opportunity to express their support or objections to the development.Councillors agreed late last year that a request should be made to the Scottish Government to call-in the application on the grounds that the development is of national signicance. That request has now been made and the council is awaiting a decision as to whether they will call in the application or not.The full application documents are available through the council website, with more information available at the application search and submission page, here.

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It acknowledged that Orkney’s internal ferry services fell short of minimum standards in terms of cost, reliability, frequency and accessibility. Since then, little progress has been made.“What has happened, however, is that the ferries operating these leline routes have got older, less reliable and more costly to run. Despite the best efforts of crews, we have seen increasing levels of disruption, including the ongoing problems with the MV Eynhallow. This situation is simply not sustainable and needs to be addressed.“Scottish Government needs to agree a clear timetable for taking forward the procurement of replacement vessels so that communities in Orkney have the leline services they deserve.

The event brought together figures from the worlds of politics, business, media and the arts to look at how the argument might be won for the future of the United Kingdom, and Scotland’s place in it.It was a timely event. Recent opinion polls show that support for Scottish independence, as against remaining in the United Kingdom, is finely balanced. Whilst the impact of Brexit arguably makes the economic case for independence weaker than it was in , the cultural impact may have been in the opposite direction.In any event, it is clear that the arguments deployed by the Better Together campaign in  are no longer as valid today as they were then. Unionism has been in search of a new narrative.At the weekend conference, the former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke about the values of “empathy, solidarity, cooperation and sharing”, which relate to the nations of the United Kingdom. Whilst language of this nature makes a great deal of sense, it is my view that a practical approach is required in terms of making the case for the Union. In that respect, I believe that there are three key areas which need to be addressed.: Here’s why I’m backing Nicola Sturgeon to win independence for Scotland – Angus Robertson: This SNP government is guilty of dereliction of duty - Brian MonteithFirstly, the UK Government has to stop sitting on the sidelines, and become more activist in its support for the Union. The old days of “devolve and forget” have to be left behind.There is a very substantial spend by the UK Government in reserved areas across Scotland, not least in pensions and defence. Faslane’s importance to the economyTo give just one illustration, the naval base at Faslane on the Clyde will now be the home to not just the nuclear-armed submarine fleet, but also conventionally armed underwater vessels.This massive investment by the Ministry of Defence within Scotland makes Faslane the second-largest single-site employer in the country, after only the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.And yet, how often do we see this huge economic footprint, and the thousands of jobs supported both directly and indirectly, made reference to in debates on the Scottish economy  We cannot expect SNP ministers to talk about it, but it should be shouted from the rooftops by their UK counterparts.In addition, the new UK Shared Prosperity Fund gives a real opportunity for Whitehall ministers to spend directly in Scotland on necessary infrastructure and other projects – demonstrating that where the SNP in Government are failing to deliver, the UK can step in and assist directly.The second area that needs to be addressed is the weakness that exists in the UK constitution, particularly as we move into a post-Brexit era. This should not be confused with the ongoing clamour from the SNP for yet more devolution to Holyrood.It is now entirely clear that the policy of devolving more powers to Scotland in response to a growth in nationalist support, in an effort to protect the Union, is one which is bankrupt.Shared wartime experiences now a distant historyThe Scottish Parliament now has fiscal powers which are the envy of many sub-national institutions in federal states. Far from making full use of these powers, we have actually seen the SNP Government hand these back – it is not willing to take on the operation of air passenger duty, despite legislation being passed to devolve it in , it has delayed the assignment of VAT, and it will not assume some new social security powers for as many as six years.Where the constitution does need attention is in relation to structures at Westminster which still need reform. There is a broad political consensus that the replacement of the House of Lords with something akin to a new Senate, representing the disparate parts of the United Kingdom, is now overdue.In addition, there requires to be a serious restructuring of inter-governmental machinery within the UK, possibly with the creation of a new Council of Ministers to provide a forum for ongoing discussion on shared policy areas, and to resolve disputes.Thirdly, a new cultural argument for the Union has to be developed. It is no longer enough to hark back to past glories. As my party leader, Jackson Carlaw, pointed out recently, to today’s youth the Second World War, and the nations of the UK standing in solidarity together against the Nazi threat, is simply distant history.I was born  years after the end of the Second World War, and my parents lived through that period. For my children, born in a dferent century entirely, it has quite a dferent impact from when someone of my age grew up with Victor comics and Commando books being a constant cultural reminder of this period in our history.A multi-cultural liberal democracyWe need to talk positively of the UK as a project – a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, liberal democracy, one which, despite our many failings, is nevertheless a remarkable success story in modern European terms. The UK is, after all, one of the few European countries not to have witnessed the rise of the far-right. London, one of the world’s great cities, is not the “Dark Star” of nationalist imaginings, but a melting pot of creed and colour, providing enormous opportunities to young Scots of this generation, just as it has done for so many generations past.As a country, our cultural output in the fields of music, film and drama, leads the world. All this lies on our doorstep, with no restrictions whatsoever on Scots living, working, and doing business, across our four nations.Writing at the weekend, the commentator Alex Massie observed that “Scotland has more in common with the rest of the United Kingdom, even after Brexit, than it does with anywhere  on earth”. That is undoubtedly true, however uncomfortable it might be to nationalists. What unionists need to do is make the argument that the UK is a positive project that we want to be a part of, and not a distant land full of dferent people, against whom we need to place barriers.What is encouraging about the output from the These Islands conference is that it is clear there is a new urgency and energy within Scottish unionism. Collectively we are finding a new way forward and a new narrative to take to the Scottish people.Murdo Fraser is a Conservative MSP for Mid Scotland and Fe©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"family of caroline flack share unpublished instagram she wanted to post","story":"The family of Caroline Flack have released an unpublished Instagram post that the star wrote in the days before her death, in which she said that within  hours her whole world and future had been swept from under her feet.The -year-old former Love Island host, who took her own le, described the domestic incident with boyfriend Lewis Burton as \"an accident\".\"On December the th  I was arrested for common assault on my boyfriend,\" she wrote. \"Within  hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet and all the walls that I had taken so long to build around me, collapsed.\"I am suddenly on a dferent kind of stage and everyone is watching it happen.\"I have always taken responsibility for what happened that night.\"Even on the night.\"But the truth is ...

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow. The route had been changed because of severe weather over the previous week, making for a course that was very heavy underfoot and flooded in several places.Todd managed to get to the front of the queue at the line and set off at a steady pace, settling in to a position within the top  or so runners after the initial surge.Over the next  minutes she maintained her form and starting easing her way up through the field to settle in sixth place as the runner approached the final quarter of the race.As the finish was coming into sight, Todd started to kick for home and her efforts were rewarded as she moved up to fourth and battled all the way to the finish line to maintain that position, getting it on the line with no more than a foot’sfrom the athlete in fth place.Coach David Wagstaff said it was a fantastic achievement for the youngster, who was not only a great prospect for the future in athletics but also an aspiring triathlete who was doing well on the junior circuit.Todd and her parents thanked NorthLink Ferries, without whose generous sponsorship participation in the cross country championships would not have been possible..."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lewis-insulation-stairs-1-web.jpg","title":"lewis couple made to feel like complete idiots over botched insulation","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineJulie Child and her we Rachel live in North Shawbost on Lewis where they also run a small café. In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH2102NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week service users at Tigh na Drochaid Resource Centre in Portree produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

And they are calling themselves the Upper Bann congregation of RPCIto dferentiate themselves from the main church, which has around  congregations in the province. Mr Dunlop confirmed that they had broken away from the RPCI over the analysis of ‘sin’ during a sermon at Loughbrickland, and the issue was raised with the sessionat the church. Mr Dunlop was one of four elders, and the minister is Rev David Silversides.He added he was not prepared to go into details, as the matter could have legal implications. But the Upper Bann website claims, “The matter spiralled out of control, when Biblical and church procedures were ignored. Spurious ‘discipline’ was enacted against a number of members and it was impossible for some to continue.” The upshot was that Mr Dunlop was excommunicated. He and another elder moved out, with  members, “for the sake of the peace of the Loughbrickland congregation”. The website adds, “As it is an ongoing controversy, still before the ecclesiastical courts – elements of which my come before the civil courts – we refrain from presenting details at present.” The website claims that members excluded from Loughbrickland were denied “constitutional redress within the RPCI”, and they decided to move to Portadown, and set up the first Covenanters Church in the town.The Watson Centre was available and they moved in earlier this month, with ‘Upper Bann Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland ’ sign on the gable wall. Rev David Silversides, who has been minister at Loughbrickland for around  years, confirmed that Mr Dunlop had been excommunicated by the church. He added, “It was a long-drawn-out situation, but I don’t want to comment any further.” He referred to the RPCI’s main ruling body – the Synod – where the clerk, Rev Edward McCollum of Ballymoney, also confirmed the excommunication. “It’s is a dficult situation and I cannot see a resolution,” he added. Mr Dunlop said the Relief group was in Portadown for the long haul and had a viable congregation of people in the wider Upper Bann area who were committed to the new church. “We are becoming well established,” he added.NI weather: The Met Office has updated the weather warning for Saturday while a warning for rain comes into effect for parts of NI Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"new trampoline park is opened","story":"Customers bounced through Jumpboxx NI#s doors for the first time last Wednesdayas the new trampoline park opened in Banbridge.The new family leisure facility, located just off the A on the Waringsford Road, is set up inside a , square foot building, and comes fully equipped for the entire family to enjoy regardless of their age or skill level.It had been thought that two trampoline parks were to open in Banbridge after planning permission was granted last year for one at the Outlet but that application was also from Jumpboxx NI before they decided on the current site.Activities available in the park include: a toddler-only bounce area for four years and under, a main bounce arena for + which includes walk the wall with two heights to challenge all bouncers, dodgeball court for family and friends to compete in a friendly environment and three basket ball lanes.There is also a main jump area with over  trampolines, a massive air bag with two jump lanes and a huge air drop , and all new aero ball for the ultra competitive while a cafe area is available for those more content to watch.The park has already hosted numerous birthday parties within its first week of operation and the management are delighted with the feedback from both parents and the birthday boys and girls.“With two party rooms and two party food options we hope there is something to keep everyone happy on their big day.

Until we accept there is a problem, there is never going to be a solution.”Oldpark SDLP councillor and the party’s homelessness spokesperson, Paul McCusker, described the figures as “worrying”.“According to figures from the Housing Executive, there is a chronic need for more social housing in North Belfast,” he added.“While housing should absolutely be allocated based on objective need, it is clear that stark disparities exist in predominantly nationalist areas, like the ones I represent in Ardoyne and Carrick Hill.“The area known as North Belfast One showed an average need of , houses in  , a steady increase since   when  homes were required. Just % of the  housing allocations in North Belfast in   were in NB while % were in NB, despite the dfering levels of requirement for social housing between both areas.“These figures are worrying but unfortunately are not surprising to many of us in North Belfast, who have been aware for some time of the dficulties. Behind these figures are families who have been waiting, many for years and in inadequate conditions, to get a house and build a home. They should not have to wait any longer.“I welcome the frank statement from Minister Hargey, who shares my concern at the inequalities highlighted. I hope she will make it a priority to redress this stark imbalance.”A spokesperson for the Housing Executive said:“We will be reviewing current record-keeping practice in light of the Minister’s comments and officials will engage with the DfC about this issue.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-21-at-16.02.40.png","title":"healthy food has never been this tasty","story":"YOU could be forgiven for wondering why a new café has opened so close to one of the busiest gyms in West Belfast. After all, who wants a feed after healthy work-out However, Kaff is a café with a dference. Located beneath GymCo in the grounds of the thriving Devenish Complex, Kaff offers a food and drink menu that is very much caterd for those gym-bunnies who hop by it daily.From a range of breakfast items to an all-day brunch, there is something for everyone on the menu – and for those who want a ‘cheat day’, fear not, Kaff offers a selection of freshly-made traybakes too, including caramel squares, raspberry ruffles and chocolate brownies.It was a Thursday lunchtime when myself and two colleagues paid a visit to Kaff, which opened a fortnight ago. We were shown to our table by a friendly and helpful member of staff.We were assured the coffee is very popular, so it would have been rude not to order my favourite, the simple, timeless, classic Cappuccino. An Americano and what I would call proper tea – the one in a pot with tealeaves – completed our drinks order.On to the food and the menu was a challenge – in a really, really good way. You can be as creative as you want using the ever-popular sourdough bread, eggs cooked the way you like them, not to mention salads, sandwiches, smashed avocado and beans.As it was lunchtime, we were drawn to the mouth-watering choices on the main food menu. I was immediately attracted to the ham hock, served with crushed potato, spring onion, spinach, a fried egg and siracha sauce. As someone who’s not exactly a gym regular, the dish was what I would describe as on the middle-range of healthiness.The pulled ham hock was melt-in-your-mouth stuff and full of flavour, perfectly-accompanied by some expertly-cooked potatoes, spinach, spring onion and perfectly fried egg, all bound together with that hot kick of siracha sauce. Every bite was mouth-watering and I would not hesitate in rushing back to Kaff to order again- it was that good. Priced at just £, it was great value for the generous portion.Across the table, a colleague was feeling creative and opted for toasted sourdough, complete with smashed avocado, smoked jalapeno salsa, poacher and black sesame. The dish had an abundance of flavour and he described it as “refreshing” given that nice kick thanks to the jalapeno. You can do a lot with sourdough bread, as you will see in many cafes across Belfast, but Kaff’s offering was unique and clearly a lot of thought was put into it.Our final lunch-goer couldn’t resist trying Kaff’s all-day breakfast – or to put it more factually, “a healthy fry”. It is was not a surprise to learn this is already proving to be a real hit with customers already – and it’s not hard to see why. It was made up of black pudding, beef sausage, grilled bacon, cherry tomatoes and some of the best poached eggs I have ever seen, all served with the aforementioned sourdough bread and smashed avocado.My colleague was particular impressed by the smashed avocado and plans a rapidjust so his better half can give it ago. I have to admit I was kind of jealous when it was brought to the table. For just £, you’d go a long way to find that quality at that value.With our stomachs satisfied, we resisted the temptation to go for an after-lunch traybake, but I was instructed via phone by a colleague back at the office towith a chocolate protein ball, which I was duly informed is essential for that tasty little bit of extra energy to get over the line in the weekly parkrun.Kaff is serving food and drink with a dference. If, like me, you have tended to pull a face whenever you’re hungry and healthy food is mentioned, then,l again like me, you’re in for a very pleasant surprise.Kaff Belfast,- Finaghy Road North,Belfast,Tel:   www.kaffbelfast"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sketch-1581936686704.png","title":"meet the inspirational lori","story":"“THE greatest pleasure in le is doing what people say you cannot do.”That is how Lori Gatsi-Barnett begins her typical day. Lori has this amazing personality she is a very good listener and that is one of her attributes that makes her your favourite TV personality. She presents Join Her at Northern Vision’s NvTv.Lori is not a household name in Northern Ireland’s TV industry but I can bet you my last shilling she is daring and it will not be long before we see a sea of work from hershe decides to work in this media sector. Imagine not having your typical chest thumping, mean drama kings and queens we are used to on our television sets.I would say she is arguably one of the most influential voices in the Black and Minority Ethnic community in all Ireland. Her fair and balanced approach is something rare these days, always well researched, the audience feels assured that this is not just a regular motivational speaker but someone who loves her job and wishes one thing: that changing one is changing many. Of course, not everyone will agree with the person on the podium. The human mind doesn’t work like that. It would be very odd and annoyingeveryone agreed with you. But those who have perfected their art in using the power of speech to change society know only too well that the more critics you attract, the better.Lori loves sports, especially basketball, which she played at professional level and she enjoys swimming whenever she gets time for it. Her le is enriched with business skills, which has helped Lori to train clients in ersity work, small and medium enterprise and corporate social responsibility. She cannot afford to be idle becauseshe doesn’t do it, someone will, that’s the reality.Last year, Lori launched a community interest company called JoinHer Network. It is an open-for-all, impartial, internationally erse group of women whose main scope of work is to change women’s lives for the better. For all women, she says, “Things may be challenging but le is what one makes it. There are many surprises out there, you will not know until you take the chance. There are no limits to what we women can do.”Belfast needs many Loris. We do.The JoinHer Network has seven solid members from dferent jobs and erse experience in the arts, community action, health and business. The group is mobilising new members from across the community to get involved in pushing for making their stories and experiences something that would inspire young women not to give up in whatever successes they have ambitions for.Besides the JoinHer network and continuing to spice up Ireland with good food for thought, Lori is absolutely the essence and mother of good TV. Headhunters should be looking right here.Finally, another factual week. The first-time ethnicity was used as a tick box in the Northern Ireland Census was in . This event provoked hopeless debates in the prelude to the census in England, for example.

In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments. The numbers have to work in terms of rental yield as well, and that is key to bear in mind and somewhere were buyers should seek advice from an expert.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland poll shows 454 back irish unity and 468 support union","story":" .% of respondents in the Republic would vote for Northern Ireland to be part of united IrelandExpand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseIn Northern Ireland, .% of respondents said Brexit had intensied the debate around our constitutional future FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappIn Northern Ireland, .% of respondents said Brexit had intensied the debate around our constitutional futureEimear McGovernFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe percentage of people in Northern Ireland who would vote for a united Ireland is almost as high as the number of those who would vote to remain the UK, according to a new poll.

The Derry featherweight was hoping to upset the odds when he took on British champion Ryan Walsh at the York Hall in London, live on Sky Sports, but despite starting well, lost a unanimous decision.McCullagh caused a stir last week when he arrived at the pre-match press conference with friend and fellow pro Tyrone McKenna dressed as characters from classic s comedy Dumb and Dumber. McCullagh was in the zone come fight night however and he began strongly but was eventually broken down by Walsh who sent him to the canvas twice throughout the fight. Walsh, who has defended the British title six times since  – including stoppage victories over Belfast’s James Tennyson and Marco McCullough, picked McCullagh as his opponent earlier in the week after picking the Golden Ball in a tournament which promises the winner a two-year, six-figure deal.This was always a huge challenge for McCullagh who stepped up in weight and class to take part in this tournament before cruising past Razaq Najib in the quarterfinals. McCullagh edge a cagey first round before clearly taking the second with straight shots down the middle.Keeping out of range, McCullagh continued to keep Walsh at bay in the third and looked more than comfortable in the early stages.It was much closer in the fourth with Walsh getting closer but the cleaner work came from the Irishman, who was again proving his doubters wrong.Disaster then struck for McCullagh however as the bout entered its second half as a right hook caught him and took away his legs completely. Following a stumble around the ring, he found himself flat on his back and seemingly very hurt. However, to his credit, McCullagh got back up and weathered the storm for the remainder of the round. Walsh was building momentum heading into the seventh round, but McCullagh was fighting back, showing he had recovered well from that knockdown. It all changed again at the start of the eighth round as a big right hand at the start followed by a body assault had McCullagh in trouble. It seemed the end was near but again McCullagh fought back and again made it through the round.Knowing he was now well behind on the scorecards, McCullagh attempted a spirited fightback, but all hope of a comeback was ended when he was forced to take another count, falling forward to his knees following a salvo from Walsh.McCullagh answered the bell from the tenth and managed to grit things out, with the contest going all the way to the judges who confirmed Walsh a unanimous decision winner with scores of -, -, and -. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I want any investment in roads to reflect the need across our entire network. I am pleased to announce this road improvement scheme on the Baranailt Road which represents an investment of pound, in the Claudy area. The work will signicantly improve the strength and surface quality of this section of the road network and will serve the local community for many years to come.”The scheme will start near the junction with the Foreglen Road and proceed along Baranailt Road for a distance of . kilometres.To facilitate the resurfacing it will be necessary to operate a road closure for the duration of the work. A two way signed ersion will be available via A Foreglen Road and B Drumrane Road. Access for residents and landowners will be maintained.The Department has programmed the work and traffic management arrangements to minimise any inconvenience, however, drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Welcoming the news, East Derry SDLP MLA John Dallat said: “It’s important that our roads network, which has degraded over three years without an Executive in place, is broad back up to standard. Investing in infrastructure like this has a positive impact on the lives of local people and I’m delighted that the Minister has made East Derry an early priority.“The SDLP will continue to work hard to deliver on the issues that matter to local people.”Completion of the work by March  is dependent on favourable weather conditions a statement from the Department said.Meanwhile, resurfacing work on the Seacoast Road, Limavady is also underway.The scheme extends from near Burnally Road, Myroe for . kilometres towards Crindle, is expected to be completed by Sunday  March . The works will greatly improve the strength and surface quality of this section of the road network.A full road closure from .am to .pm daily is currently in operation until Sunday, March .During the road closure a ersion will be in operation via Aghanloo Road - Windyhill Road - Ballykelly Road - Seacoast Road and vice versa.For traffic information about this and other improvement schemes visit: www.trafficwatchni googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As an elected representative who is pro-actively working on behalf of everyone living in our local community, it is always pleasing when having worked with the relevant statutory agencies on issues of major importance to local residents, to have residents concerns fully addressed while ensuring the implementation of a programme of essential work. Addressing the issue of the need to finally complete Magheras Highway To Health by linking footpaths along Crew Road and Station Road, Cllr McGuigan added: I have been given strong assurances that relevant council staff are actively pursuing the need to have this vital issue of public safety addressed in the very near future. Working alongside others including relevant statutory agencies, they are sourcing very much needed public finance to have the project completed. This important issue is being given strong attention at this time. I am very confident that we will soon have the highway to health completed as it is vital for ensuring public safety, healthy living and community well-being. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Unfortunately, we dont have an Irish language secondary school yet but there has been a massive intake in the primary schools over the past  to  years,” she said.Cultuacuterlann Uiacute Chanaacutein are celebrating their thbirthday this year and it was marked with the highest intake of adult learners so far with over  learners attending classes weekly.Mayor Michaela Uiacute Bhaoil has said she is delighted to be able to launch Seachtain na Gaeilge and she is looking forward to attending as many events as she can.“Its fantastic that we have organisations like Foras na Gaeilge and Cultuacuterlann Uiacute Chanaacutein in operaton throughout the district as its so important that we promote the language.“Irish schools and organisations do amazing things on such a small budget and when you look at the children who attend Irish schools, it provides fantastic opportunities for the children and their families.”Seachtain na Gaeilge runs from March - and the full programme of events can be found atwww.derrystrabane gaeilge and Culturlann.org. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Leitrim Road will be open to traffic in the evenings during the week and all weekend.The Department of Infrastructure says that it has programmed the resurfacing work and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but warns that drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Confirmation of the Leitrim Road scheme has been welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and SLieve Croob councillor Hugh Gallagher.Mr McGrath said the resurfacing scheme represents signicant investment in a rural area.He continued: ldquoThere has been concern for some time among many people in South Down that there is a regional disparity between how much investment rural areas have received compared to the more urban counterparts.ldquoI am absolutely delighted that infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon is working to alleviate that. When the Assembly was restored I spoke about how she would work to connect communities. In this instance that is literally what she is achieving. This is win for everyone.Mr McGrath said he looked forward to the completion of the Leitrim Road scheme and asked drivers to be patient as work progresses and use the ersions that will be in place.Cllr Gallagher said while Slieve Croob is a ldquomost beautul area,roads are not up to scratch, no one will enjoy the location.ldquoThis resurfacing scheme is about more than just making the road fit purpose. It can act as a driver for future investment in this area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Archaeologists.jpg","title":"Archaeologists find ‘treasures’ during dig  ","story":"SOME of the medieval lsquotreasuresrsquo unearthed during a dig at Down Cathedral last year will be revealed next month.Excavation director Brian Sloan from the Centre for Archaeological Fieldwork, Queenrsquos University Belfast, will display several of the items recovered when he gives a talk at Down County Museum on Wednesday, March , from .pm.Last summer archaeologists from the centre, working alongside members of the community, discovered hundreds of medieval artefact in a dig at a site adjacent to Down Cathedral.More then  people took part in the dig mdash most of them young mdash while it also attracted some , visitors to come along to view the process.An earlier community dig in  had exposed a medieval kitchen building and associated rubbish pits at the siteLast yearrsquos dig went further and produced hundreds of medieval artefacts, including some surprises, reinforcing the importance of Downpatrick during the medieval period and before.Some of the artefacts included medieval pottery, animal bones, bronze pins, an Early Christian cross slab and a bronze section of a medieval cross with settings for precious stones.Wooden barrel staves were found at the bottom of one pit and Mr Sloan at the lecture will reveal how they have been dated.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey encouraged all those interested to attend the free event.He said: ldquoThe archaeological excavation revealed some very exciting and unusual objects and shows how important this site was in the medieval period.The attendance at the dig during the summer shows how widespread interest is in archaeology and this talk will provide people with a great opportunity to find out more.The dig was part of a series of projects funded by Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilrsquos PEACE IV programme.The digs were designed to find out more about le in the past, but also to help people understand local history and culture and gain skills in working in archaeology.Members of the Centre for Archaeological Fieldwork spent five weeks investigating the site working alongside volunteers.The archaeological project was supported by

Ballykinlar.jpg","title":"Ballykinlar community facility unused over power supply issue  ","story":"A COMMUNITY centre in Ballykinlar is lying unused because it has no electricity supply, it emerged this week.Newry, Mourne and Down councillors heard on Monday night that the long awaited Ballykinlar Community Centre has yet to be occupied even though it has been ready since Christmas.The issue is that NIE Networks is having problems getting agreement from the Ministry of Defence to carry out work on its land at the nearby disused army barracks in order to get a mains supply to the council-run facility.The centre, a prefabricated building formerly used by the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service in Downpatrick, was moved to the former Kindle Primary School School site in Ballykinlar.Councillors attending a meeting of the Active and Healthy Communities Committee were told that the connection agreement ldquocould be a long-term problem and the longer the facility is left unoccupied, the more prone it will become to vandalism.They also heard that Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association was ldquovery keen to open the facility with numerous users waiting to move in.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason urged council officers to step in and to seea temporary supply of electricity could provided by generators in the interim.She said: ldquoThe community groups are crying out to use these facilities and a lot of things depend on it such as the allotments and formation of a new Menrsquos Shed.Downpatrick councillor John Trainor also asked the council to see what could be done as he said it was clear that the facility was much needed.Council officer Janine Hillen offered a temporary solution of using pound, to pay for the use of electricity generators until it ran out, which was proposed by Cllr Mason and seconded by Cllr Trainor.If a generator is used to provide electricity to Ballykinlar Community Centre, it will be the second council facility to use this method as a generator is used at the Flying Horse civic amenity centre in Downpatrick.Yesterday Cllr Mason said it was ldquocompletely unacceptable that the Ballykinlar community have been let down on this.ldquoThis community group have worked tirelessly to get this much needed new facility in the village, she remarked. ldquoBoth council officials and County Down Rural Community Network have worked alongside the community to secure funding and resources for the site, but they now find themselves unable to use it due to lack of an electricity connection.ldquoIt is imperative that NIE and the Ministry of Defence overcome any barriers that is stopping this electricity connection.Cllr Mason said South Down MP Chris Hazzard had made representations to the Secretary of State to stress the importance of the community facility for Ballykinlar and to ldquosort this issue as soon as possible.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he would continue to call on the council to get the matter sorted out as soon as possible.ldquoIrsquom very annoyed to think that this much-needed facility is lying idle as the community has been waiting on this for years.ldquoPeople were delighted to have been told that they would get this facility on a site which had been used as a drinking den and itrsquos about time they were able to use it.After the meeting Niall Addis, chairman of the Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association, spoke of his growing frustration at not being able to use the centre.ldquoWe are all so ready to get into the building and use it, said Mr Addis, ldquoApart from our group, the Forever Young pensioners group wants to use it, the Allotments Society, a new Menrsquos Shed and I have at least five people who wish to hold parties at the

With representatives from Tels Fitness, Murlough AC, Crossgar Harriers and Down Triathlon Club and some solo runners joining our own crowd, there was a jolly band of nearly  runners hitting the streets.Storm Dennis was a bit of a concern, but having consulted the weather charts it was decided to proceed with caution. In actual fact, although there was a taxing head wind at some points, it was dry until after all ed, so Denis was not able to put off these hardcore folk.They soon warmed up with hot drinks and snacks and the general feeling was that it was a good job, well done. All reported that they were looking forward to the real event with even more anticipation having had the tester.Last One StandingAs usual, on this weekend every year, the Last One Standing take place in Castleward.Admittedly, the organisers donrsquot usually have to consider the elements to any great extent as it is an endurance test of the inidual against whatever arises, but the warnings about the arrival of Storm Dennis meant that extra caution had to be exercised this year.With most of the course on grass or muddy forest tracks and with much of it also under the usually benign shelter of the many trees, consideration of the likely effects of the much heralded Storm Dennis had to be a priority.However, cometh the hour cometh the manwho were undaunted by the prospect of storm force rain and wind in their attempts to attain the coveted title of Last One Standing .I personally have to take my hat off to every one who set out on the journey, which no one knows how long it will take or how far it will be, depending as it does on the persistence and bloody mindedness of those participating.The format is basically that every runner has to be on the start line at  noon on Saturday and they then have to complete the course of . miles within the hour and be on the start line again at pm and so on for every hour thereafter.Anyone who fails to finish within the hour or who fails to be on the start line when the next hour begins is automatically excluded from further participation.So, then it develops into a poker game of who will keep going the longest as hour after hour the field gradually reduces until only one person begins what will be the final lap, which he she has to complete to be declared the Last One Standing.In theory, anyone can win, though there are, like in every branch of sport, those who will attract greater support as favourites because of their previous experience at this type of physical activity. Among those would be the likes of previous winner Peter Cromie, from Omagh and Cork man Eoin Keith, who has won many long distance events both in Ireland and abroad, including setting records over  hours endurance races, where the emphasis is on how far one can travel in the allotted time, unlike this one, where itrsquos a case of how long can one keep going for, knowing that all one hour will yield will be . miles.But they have the stickability factor which is so important in this type of event.

This film is her fight to understand the events that shaped her le, in order to move on.The storyline has some parallels with her own le as before her family moved to New York, her father was sentenced to six years in the former Long Kesh prison after being arrested in  on suspicion of carrying a weapon.Apart from writing and filming The Shore at Killough, which was produced by Oorlagh, Terry early earned his film-making credentials as the screenwriter for the film, In the Name of the Father , based on the story of the Guildford Four and wrote the screenplay and directed Some Motherrsquos Son .He has since gone on to write other major films such as The Promise in .While Oolagh worked alongside her father in some of his productions, she has branched out on her own and is currently developing a television drama called Faultline, which she co-created with The Wire writer, Edward Burns.It took six years for Oorlagh Georgersquos screen play of Stranger with a Camera to make it into production. The project has been developed through Sundance Institutersquos Screenwriting and Directing Labs.Oorlagh is producing the film with Mary Ann Marino , Molly Egan , and John Wallace .The film is supported by Sundance Institute, Northern Ireland Screen and Screen Ireland, with additional grant support by The Utah Film Centre and Artemis Rising..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Schoolchildren.jpg","title":"Schoolchildren name social housing scheme in Crossgar  ","story":"A NEW social housing scheme in the heart of Crossgar has been officially named.Work on a scheme by Clanmil Housing to build  homes on a former derelict site in Downpatrick Street is nearing completion and has been named Everogue Lane.Housing officials approached Glasswater Primary School and Cedar Integrated Primary School to ask pupils to take part in a competition to name the new development by coming up with an imaginative name that would reflect the sitersquos surroundings or some other interesting aspect of the local area.A total of  entries were received from P pupils at the two schools, the most imaginative of which were submitted to Newry, Mourne and Down Council to select the winning name.The developmentrsquos new name reflects the original name for the village, Everogues Bridge, before it became known as Crossgar, with the winning name a combination of ideas from former Glasswater pupil Grace Chapman and Gabriel Gormley, a former pupil at Cedar.Clanmilrsquos community cohesion officer, Philip Whyte, presented Grace and Gabriel with Amazon Fire tablets in recognition of their creativity.ldquoWe are delighted by the interest that the children have shown in our development and very impressed by the standard and range of names suggested, he said.ldquo Well done to everyone who got involved and thank you to the schools for helping with the competition.ldquoCongratulations to Gabriel and Grace who have together come up with the perfect name for the scheme.

Our wedding planner team had to be very well organised to ensure that both grooms and their bridal parties were escorted unseen into separate rooms before the ceremony but it was all worth it. We wish the happy couple well for the future.While the couple are now honeymooning on the Costa Blanca, Shane spoke to the Recorder about what the day meant to them and their families.ldquoIt was absolutely brilliant and we canrsquot thank our family and friends for being so supportive, he said.ldquoIt means so much to Connor and I and our families that we are now married and that is legally recognised. Our families came together so well and have been really supportive from day one when we first came out. They have been behind us the entire way.Shane believes that he and Connor, whorsquos originally from South Devon, were meant for each other.ldquoFor me, it was definitely love at first sight. Once we got together, we became inseparable, said Shane, whorsquos a support worker for Autism Initiatives in Newcastle.ldquoI just loved Connorrsquos personality and how caring he was as a person and how he would do anything for anyone. Of course, hersquos also beautul.For Connor, who works in a Newcastle cafeacute, said he was drawn to Shanersquos ldquoopen, honest face and knew right away he was ldquoa good guy.When the two young men decided to commit to one another, they initially believed that it would be a civil partnership ceremony.Same-sex marriage was only made legal in Northern Ireland mdash in line with the rest of the UK mdash on January  as it was voted in by MPs in the House of Commons last autumn. Only the re-opening of the Stormont Executive could have prevented it becoming law and the Executive did notuntil after the necessary deadline date last October.Shane explained: ldquoWe registered for a civil partnership for our date last week but then when the law was passed on January , we gave our  days notice to the registry office that we were going to be married rather than the civil partnership. it was all go from then.ldquoWe did think of getting married in England as Connor is originally from there but my grandmother Kathleen Robinson is coming  this year and we couldnrsquot expect her to get on a plane to come to England.However, the couple did not expect their wedding to attract so much media attention as they were interviewed live on the Nolan Show on BBC One Northern Ireland after the ceremony.Another same-sex couple, Robyn Peoples and Sharni Edwards, married in Carrickfergus the day before Shane and Connor.BBC Breakfast initially asked themthey could cover their wedding by contacting Hugh McCannrsquos first.Shane explained: ldquoWe turned them down at the start as we were afraid of any backlash, but then the producer from the Nolan Show actually got in contact with our photographer so we were approached by them from every angle. We only agreed to appear on the show just two days before the wedding.Shane and Connor realise that while many people will celebrate their union, there is still a large group of people in Northern Ireland who remain opposed to same-sex marriage.But for them, it was just about being seen as a couple like everyone .ldquoWe just wanted to be married and didnrsquot carewe were the first, said Shane.ldquoObviously now we know we are the first male couple. Itrsquos a really big thing and part of Northern Irelandrsquos history so we feel privileged to be a part of it.The couple intend to make Co Down their home in the future and see themselves as parents.Shane said: ldquoWe would love to have children, whether thatrsquos by using a surrogate or by adopting, but itrsquos definitely one of the big things in our future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Storm.jpg","title":"Storm sewage deluge  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Ballynahinch have appealed for an end to what they have described as a ldquoflooding nightmare at the busy Lisburn Street junction with Main Street in the town.Persistent heavy rain swept in by Storm Dennis last Saturday left the busy Ballynahinch junction under water with traders forced to take precautions to protect their property.Storm water and raw sewage flow into a combined drain which struggles to cope when there is heavy rain, with speculation locally that a section of underground piping is blocked.Matt Comiskey, of Jordyrsquos Bar, said sewage was evident during last Saturdayrsquos deluge and revealed that while the issue has been raised with NI Water on a number of occasions, no affirmative action has been taken.He has been informed that work to address the issue will result in a section of Lisburn Street having to be dug up. He said it is important this happens as soon as possible.ldquoI am fed up ringing NI Water about this issue, the businessman declared.ldquoI have been given countless reference numbers by officials but no one is doing anything about this. The business community at this part of Ballynahinch should not have to put out sand bags every time there is heavy rain.Mr Comiskey described last Saturdayrsquos flooding incident as ldquoserious and revealed that he had to close a metal shutter at the entrance to the bar to prevent a mix of rain water and sewage from entering the premises.ldquoThis problem needs to be sorted as the issue impacts on a number of businesses. Six months ago the local council gave us sand bags and while a drainage firm has examined the drains on several occasions, its staff have told us that there is nothing that they can do, he said.Mr Comiskey said there is speculation locally that debris from work on Ballynahinchrsquos public realm scheme which was completed several years ago may be causing blockage.He also revealed that the volume of water being forced up through drains is powerful enough to lt heavy metal covers which could damage passing cars.Mr Comiskey added: ldquoWhen the drain overflows you can see raw sewage mixed with storm water. Every time there is heavy rain we have to be on our guard. We have been flooded in the past and do not want this to happen again.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is seeking an urgent meeting with NI Water engineers to discuss the flooding issue.He said there is increasing concern about the problem at the Main Street junction with Lisburn Street where there is a combined sewer which deals with rain water and raw sewage.ldquoBusiness owners should not be forced to take measures to protect their properties with sand bags when there is heavy rain. While the storm drains at this part of Ballynahinch have been cleared with powerful water jets, the problem continues to persist.ldquoWe cannot continue to allow raw sewage to spew out of storm drains next to businesses. The current situation is unacceptable and must be addressed.The Rowallane politician has also asked that work to resolve the combined sewer issue must be carried out in the evening to minimise the disruption that it will inevitably have on town centre traffic.Cllr Walker added: ldquoGiven the fact that raw sewage is involved, this issue must be dealt with immediately. Every time there is heavy rain, business owners are running for sand bags in order to protect their properties. They should not have to live like this.A spokeswoman for NI Water said that its wastewater team has confirmed that the combined sewer is operating ldquonormally and that the issue at Lisburn Street in Ballynahinch is a matter for the Department for Infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford residents in local boost  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Strangford can now keep up to date with all that is happening in the village, thanks to a boost from the Big Lottery Fund.It is financing a new village noticeboard, website and newsletter to keep everyone in Strangford abreast of all that is going on.Given the many clubs and societies in Strangford mdash which currently number  mdashthe villagersquos residentsrsquo group is delighted with the Big Lottery Fundrsquos cash windfall which ensures that it can deliver in its vow to improve communication.Group member Jenner OrsquoReilly has been writing feature articles in the newsletter about inidual residents and it has been a great hit.

Some of the volunteer workers from ious countries assigned to this duty dreaded the ominous ‘pancake day’ as it often had its share of disasters, giving them the in-house nickname of ‘panic cakes’! In the ious hotel and catering establishments I have worked in over the years, eventhey were secular, there was always the obligatory ‘Pancake Day’ or ‘Shrove Tuesday,’ even though the tradition is linked to the fasting of Lent that begins the following day on Ash Wednesday observed by Protestant and Catholic denominations as a precursor to Easter.

Please try again later.Submitting...Today many folk celebrate this holiday without even realising its ecclesiastical connections. It was a day to use up eggs, milk and other rich foods before the  day fasting period.This gave rise to the name ‘carnival’ coming from the Latin ‘carnem lee’and for others ‘Mardi Gras’ meaning ‘Fat Tuesday.’ Pope Gregoryissued the following rule to Augustine in Canterbury: “We abstain from flesh, meat, and from all things that come from flesh, as milk, cheese and eggs.” Ash is still daubed on the foreheads of participants on Ash Wednesday in some denominations from burnt palm fronds made into crosses from the previous year, almost reminiscent of some religious practices in India, but which was linked to the time of penitence and confession.I have never panicked making pancakes, but I do question whether Jesus would actually require this practice from anyone who chooses to follow Him  Certainly there were no such traditions in the early church. Jesus fasted in the wilderness for us. We don’t need to do it ourselves. Fasting can come freely at any time of the year, but not by ecclesiastical obligation. Besides, following Him and not religious traditions invented by men is the best recipe for success in my book.Colin Nevin, Chef, Israel -"},{"url":null,"title":"stormont mlas returned work agreeing deal read christmas wish list and now they are holding out begging bowl ","story":"Man’s body found lying on shoreline of NI town - post mortem to be carried outArmy veteran who took his own le a ‘victim of the IRA’NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionLettersStormont MLAs ed to work by agreeing a deal that read like a Christmas wish list, and now they are holding out a begging bowlLast week saw the infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon publicly complain that she does not have enough money in her budget to keep the lights on.By The NewsroomTuesday, th February , : pm\"\"Letter to the editorWith an annual budget of just shy of £m for revenue andcapital, it is hard to take her seriously.It seems instead that she does not want to prioritise it over other aspects of the remit she now holds.On the one hand, infrastructure is vital to the Northern Ireland economy and it needs spending for sure.Our roads, rail, broadband and public transport networks keep the place moving.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The pupils were then asked to redesign the maps by using their knowledge of the local area. They identied key landmarks, short cuts and potential barriers to walking and cycling.The pupils also developed a set of symbols and a map key which will be used in the new map.Sustrans also held a parent engagement workshop where they invited families to identy routes that they and their children use.Sustrans will produce a bilingual pocket-sized travel map which will be available to students, staff and parents for free. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Some % of orchestral musicians who joined the industry in the past  years are involved in community outreach, and % of all orchestras.\"Groups like the Keith Little Jazz Trio in Penarth do incredible work with organisations such as Music in Hospitals  Care. Veteransrsquo choirs also provide opportunities in music to a whole new range of people.In another Westminster debate on fire risk in flats and shared housing, I raised the concerns of many constituents relating to building defects, fire safety issues and other matters. I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings. We should be working on this on a UK-wide basis.I also secured my own debate on incineration of industrial and commercial waste. Irsquom supporting campaigners in the east of Cardf who oppose a planned new incinerator and have concerns over emissions and the impact of HGVs near schools and homes.With an existing incinerator near Cardf Bay, and continuing controversy over the biomass plant in Barry docks in our neighbouring constituency, this is an area of concern for many people locally. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
