Reflecting on the year, Lisa said she\u0027s glad she did it but \u0027it\u0027s really, really hard work.\u0027\u0027Balancing jobs on top of it all was stressful and we couldn\u0027t do it permanently,\u0027 Lisa said. She also says that more pressure should be put on businesses to reduce their waste instead of putting all the onus on iniduals to make these changes.She added: \u0027We can\u0027t do it by ourselves - it has to be done on a much larger scale with more companies looking at their waste. For us it\u0027s taught us so much about how much waste we use and how much small things can build up.\u0027Lisa says she would recommend anyone to do it, even if it\u0027s not for a year.\u0027Even if it\u0027s just for a month or two, it can really make a difference,\u0027 said Lisa. But she added: \u0027It\u0027s important not to feel guilty about buying packaged foods - everyone has different circumstances and you just do what you can, really. If everyone just does what they can manage, that\u0027s all you can ask.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Muslim Jewish leaders pay historic joint visit Auschwitz","story":"Share this article \u0027To be here, among the children of Holocaust survivors and members of the Jewish and Islamic communities, is both a sacred duty and a profound honor,\u0027 Al-Issa said. \u0027The unconscionable crimes to which we bear witness today are truly crimes against humanity.

The proposed building must meet the performance of the notional design to pass the test.Critically, the new changes to the regulations would remove something called the Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard, meaning a building designed next year could be allowed to perform much worse than one built in 2013, when the current standards were introduced. Similarly, a building that would fail to meet the current regulations would pass under the new system. Part L applies to all buildings, although the current consultation covers only dwellings.Secondly, Leti warns that a proposed emphasis on overall carbon footprint will help to mask the actual energy performance of new homes. The government intends to introduce a new factor into the assessment, related to the energy efficiency of the grid, not the building itself. Because the National Grid has been rapidly decarbonising over the last few years, as more renewables have been connected, the new method of assessment would show that a home produced lower carbon emissions than before – despite the design being exactly the same.“The new proposals totally mask the actual energy efficiency of a home,” says Clare Murray, head of sustainability at architecture firm Levitt Bernstein and member of Leti. “They make the building look like it is performing better, when the reality is it could be much worse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08099cdbf03cb1f27a8cf0226d2123b958d0cf46/521_636_2044_1226/master/2044.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=316d983067610162a794c10946b32501","title":"publishers defend american dirt claims cultural appropriation jeanine cummins oprah","story":"Jeanine Cummins’s novel, acclaimed by Oprah Winfrey, Stephen King and others, also faces scathing criticism from Latinx writersJeanine Cummins’s British publisher, Headline, is standing shoulder to shoulder with the American press that published her isive thriller, declaring that it is proud to publish her in the UK. As the backlash continues over her novel about migration from Mexico to the US, the imprint acknowledged the book has “sparked debate about the legitimacy of who gets to tell which stories”.American Dirt, the high-octane story of a Mexican mother who crosses into the US with her son, was published this week. It was acquired for a seven-figure sum by Flatiron Books in the US, and received effusive pre-publication praise from authors including Stephen King and Don Winslow. It went on to land a film deal and win selection from Oprah’s Book Club – a surefire guarantee of bestsellerdom.Kate Horan, director of McAllen Public Library, which is on the US-Mexico border, said she had been invited to partner with Oprah’s Book Club to celebrate the novel. She declined, saying that instead she would be compiling a list of books “by authentic Latinx authors” to make available to her community.Cummins acknowledged from the start that her decision to tell this story raised questions, writing in an author’s note of her concern that “as a non-immigrant and non-Mexican, I had no business writing a book set almost entirely in Mexico, set entirely among immigrants”, and adding that she “wished someone slightly browner than me would write it”.After the controversy blew up, Cummins addressed American booksellers, telling bookshop manager Javier Ramirez at an event in Baltimore that she had struggled with the question of what gave her the right to tell the story “for a very long time”.“I lived in fear of this moment, of being called to account for myself: ‘Who do you think you are?’” she said. “And in the end, the people who I met along the way, the migrants who I spoke to, the people who have put themselves in harm’s way to protect vulnerable people, they showed me what real courage looks like. They made me recognise my own cowardice. When people are really putting their lives on the line, to be afraid of writing a book felt like cowardice.”Bowles, who teaches literature and Nahuatl at the University of Texas Río Grande Valley, said there was “nothing wrong with a non-Mexican writing about the plight of Mexicans”.“What’s wrong is erasing authentic voices to sell an inaccurate cultural appropriation for millions,” he wrote, blaming Cummins’s “enablers” – including Flatiron, Winfrey, and newspapers who “printed fawning pieces” about the book. Mexican-American writers, he said, have been writing about the border for years: “However, none of us has been advanced as much money or had … publishing, press, and personalities marshalled to promote us in quite this way.” Online, authors provided lists of alternatives to American Dirt. “Read something told in our own voices,” wrote Gurba, pointing to titles including Luis Alberto Urrea’s The House of Broken Angels, and Reyna Grande’s A Dream Called Home.According to PublishersLunch, Cummins told booksellers that the question needed to be “directed more firmly toward publishers than at inidual writers … I was never going to turn down money that someone offered me for something that took me seven years to write,” she said. “I acknowledge that there is tremendous inequity in the industry, about who gets attention for writing what books.”Flatiron has said that “some of the biggest names in Latinx literature are championing the novel”, but added that it was “carefully listening” to the debate.“The concerns that have been raised, including the question of who gets to tell which stories, are valid ones in relation to literature and we welcome the conversation,” it said. According to the publisher, the novel asks, “How far will a mother go to protect her son?” and provokes empathy with people “struggling to find safety in our unsafe world. This is the lens through which we have viewed American Dirt as the publisher, and the way in which we hope it can be appreciated by readers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a1c2b6a46edbaca396e82f32d761a6e8c2c62f5/30_77_3351_2011/master/3351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e688a7fec5a5f5f09a7a42ae1bc6572e","title":"what did we learn from davos 2020","story":"Climate crisis, Greta Thunberg and Trump were at core of 50th World Economic Forum Since 1971, politicians, business leaders, academics, journalists and representatives of civil society have been travelling to the Swiss ski resort of Davos, the town immortalised by Thomas Mann in his novel The Magic Mountain.The meeting – described as the place where billionaires tell millionaires how the middle classes should live their lives – ended on Friday. So what did we learn from the 50th gathering?This was the “global heating Davos”, with session after session devoted to the topic. For Mark Carney, in his last weeks as governor of the Bank of England before stepping down, the story was not the near unanimity among policymakers, but that the financial sector – including the big banks of Wall Street – now understands the investment risk of global heating and is starting to adjust its behaviour accordingly.At the start of the 2019 Davos, Thunberg was a 16-year-old Swedish student going on strike from school to protest against the lack of action on global heating. She electrified last year’s WEF and was even bigger news this time, going toe-to-toe with Donald Trump and members of his cabinet, and getting the better of the exchanges. Most seasoned Davos hands thought Steve Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, had blundered when he said he would only start listening to Thunberg when she had a degree in economics.Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and\u0026nbspthe elaborate system of badges\u0026nbspreveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations.For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all\u0026nbspa big waste of time.\u0026nbspThe 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.\u0026nbspFor the second time in three years, Trump turned up at the annual festival of globalisation – more visits than Bill Clinton and Barack Obama managed between them in the combined 16 years of their presidencies. The chief executives of the multinationals that flock to Davos find Trump strangely compelling in spite of his anti-globalist views. He was comfortably the biggest draw of the week. There were a few titters as Trump boasted of the economic miracle he has created in the US, but privately American big business likes tax cuts, likes deregulation and would rather have him in the White House than any Democrat.It would be wrong to imagine that UK plc is jumping for joy that Britain is leaving the EU at the end of next week, but there is a sense of relief that much of the uncertainty is over. A year ago, when Theresa May was struggling vainly to get her withdrawal bill through parliament, businesses were putting investment on hold because they were in the dark about how Brexit would unfold. Following last month’s general election, some of the projects that were mothballed have been given the go-ahead. The global economy may also have bottomed out.Along with Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau, Boris Johnson decided that hobnobbing with people Theresa May once called the citizens of nowhere was not the best political look. At one time it looked as if there would be no UK cabinet minister in Davos, but in the end Sajid Javid was left to fly the flag. There were plenty of ex-ministers around though: the former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, the former prime minister Gordon Brown and the former chancellor George Osborne among them. May also did a turn to the citizens of nowhere at a PwC drinks reception.On the first day of Davos, the  broke the story that the Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, had apparently been hacked by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. Cybersecurity is always on the agenda and there was a personal twist this year, because many of those attending Davos came into contact with Prince Mohammed on the trip when he met Bezos and maybe also exchanged mobile phone numbers with him.  tracked down three of them: Mnuchin the Apple CEO, Tim Cook and the Microsoft boss, Satya Nadella. However, despite their public commitments to openness and transparency, none was prepared to talk about it.There wasn’t an awful lot to laugh about in Davos, what with the backdrop of global heating, cyber-threats, and the coronavirus. But there were the odd moments of levity. Trump provided one of them, albeit unwittingly, with his claim that the US was enjoying a “boom the likes of which the world has never seen”. That would only be true if American history began on the day he was elected president. Javid provided one of the others. Pressing the flesh at a CBI lunch, he was asked by one business leader: “Who are you?” Not realising he was being teased, a visibly taken aback Javid replied: “I’m the chancellor.”Davos says it gets the existential threat of the climate crisis, but does it really? Prince Charles flew to Switzerland by private jet, before switching to an electric car to give the WEF the benefit of his wisdom on how to save the planet. One delegate, kept waiting in the cold while Trump was being whisked from the conference centre to his hotel, tried to count the number of cars in the president’s motorcade and wasn’t quite sure whether there were 37 or 39. The WEF says most attendees arrived by train and that the Zurich group will plant 13,000 trees: one for every one of the bright blue bobble hats it has handed out for free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bca19f62dd501ef57a39ff0f67b928146508ad7f/0_50_1939_1163/master/1939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e561ca78c73adc693098d9c04e87b911","title":"brexit wetherspoons 31 january leave eu","story":"I’m not sure what I’ll be doing on 31 January, when the UK officially leaves the EU at midnight – Brussels time (just in case you thought things were going to be on our terms, now). Marching feels inappropriate and possibly dangerous. Spelling out an “SOS” that is visible from space would be logistically challenging. Maybe, as on the day after the referendum result, I’ll head to my local cheap and cheerful Italian for a Birra Moretti and some clam spaghetti and sit there, miserably, to a soundtrack of Andrea Bocelli like the filthy, sentimental remainer I am. Maybe I’ll get completely off my face. All I know is that I definitely won’t be in Wetherspoons, which is cutting its drinks prices to celebrate, in a campaign it is calling “Let’s stay friends”.In the past four years there hasn’t been a company that has championed Brexit more than Wetherspoons and its chairman, Tim Martin. The chain of pubs has produced millions of pro-Brexit beermats– prompting concerns about corporate governance – and a special Brexit-themed edition of Wetherspoons News. It has removed European beers from its menu, replaced Jägermeister with an English equivalent to create the “Brexit bomb”, and ditched champagne and prosecco in favour of English, New Zealand and Australian wines. I’ve drunk buckets of wine in Wetherspoons pubs – some of it from a tap – and honestly, it could have come from the lush vineyards of Scunthorpe for all I cared. Let’s just say that terroir was not my overriding concern in those days. And yet, it all rankles.I’ve fallen out of love with Wetherspoons, you see. Ours was a dirty love, all-consuming through my teenage years, then later underpinned by a fond nostalgia, as though for an ex who never left your hometown. I may have moved to London and become a bit gastro, but the appeal of a quick one never faded. It was cheap, and a bit filthy. It did the job. It felt like home.When I was in my mid-to-late teens there was an established routine. Our parents would drop us off in the car park round the back. There, we would consume a bottle of Aldi’s finest Badger’s Creek wine, before stashing the other bottle in our favoured shrub and heading inside, where everyone from school would be waiting. The Wetherspoons was in an old Catholic church. I have dim memories of going to see the priest there with a friend and her mother when I was very young: the spartan, dusty living quarters, the echoing emptiness of the place. When it became a pub it was full, jubilant. We sang our hymns at fever pitch and gave confession while nursing comically large fonts of sauv blanc. Repented upstairs in the loos, speaking to God down the big, white porcelain telephones.Later, when my brother moved to a care home, we’d take him out to Wetherspoons. He’d have fish and chips, or a burger. Sometimes he would hoot with excitement, and flap his hands – all symptoms of his autism. I was always struck by how no one batted an eyelid. Wetherspoons has seen it all. In fact, it was one of the few places where you’d often see people with disabilities. Lots of older people too, and people who clearly didn’t have much cash. Wetherspoons’ prices have kept it inclusive, like an informal community centre.I’ve always vociferously defended Wetherspoons against perceived snobbery, as when the Sunday Times restaurant critic Marina O’Loughlin ate in one for the first time in October 2017. She described the scampi, which my mum usually orders, as “stiff orange coffins emitting an ooze of vaguely fishy goo. Their peas somehow have a haunting backnote of fag ash” – she’s a brilliant writer. Yet I was irked by her review because it felt like she was implying something negative about my family and our tastes, our lack of money, possibly our class. As my husband says when MasterChef is on: “Chill out, it’s just a bit of dinner.” But in this country, it never is.I don’t think Marina was necessarily wrong about the food, and she certainly didn’t deserve the abuse that ensued. I’m curious as to why so many of us imbue a chain of cheapo pubs with such sentimental significance, to the point where even the carpets are fetishised. Wetherspoons seems to have become another front for a proxy culture war that’s about so much more than just Brexit. It’s infused with our ideas about social class and belonging, and who we ultimately are.Since the referendum, I haven’t felt like going in, much. It hasn’t been a conscious boycott unfortunately, it’s coincided with my brother struggling with public spaces. Unlike some remainers, I don’t have a list of Brexit-backing companies I refuse to do business with. But Martin’s rabidly pro-Brexit stance has alienated me, and it feels weird giving him my money. I still think Brexit is colossally stupid, and often underpinned by bigotry (it should be noted, by the by, that Martin says he is pro-immigration and in 2016 one in 10 Wetherspoons staff was from overseas). At the same time, I’ve done enough research into how the referendum has ided families, and spoken to enough Brexit voters, to know that isolating ourselves from the rest of society is not going to heal the deep isions in this country. You can’t escape where you are from, though at times I’ve tried. It’s true that I live in a bubble, surrounded by remainers. Yet I knew enough of my brother’s North Wales constituency to understand that it would switch from red to blue in the general election. To have seen the dying high street: Wetherspoons being one of the few thriving businesses.So, while I won’t be in there on the 31st, necking a Brexit bomb and singing Rule Britannia, it won’t be long, I’m sure, until I’m back in the Coronet on Holloway Road – a beautiful cinema with art nouveau ironwork – worshipping at the altar of cheap G\u0026ampT and trying, again, to love my neighbour, despite everything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ff9858790b0e8dcb45707d915d32b26329aef7d/0_203_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=560ddd6c666935a1a3ac16220bfb5495","title":"rising tide female gamblers help","story":"A couple of clicks to bet on the football: a win. Little did I know that in such a short space of time those clicks would lead me to losing my home and my job. I started gambling during a period of intense loneliness in my life. I was in an abusive relationship and my self-esteem was at an all-time low.My partner introduced me to online gambling in passing, sitting on the sofa one evening. It didn’t feel like a big deal, just something to do on your phone while the TV played in the background. I won the very first time I made a bet. It gave me an instant buzz – a feeling of gratification I think I had been missing in my life.This first win would come to shape the way I viewed gambling. It hooked me in, and I gradually spent more and more time over the following months chasing that initial high. Many others are like me, seeking a buzz that they don’t find in other places. For other women, it’s not a buzz but a numbness they seek from being in the gambling “bubble”. Gambling can sometimes be a reaction to depression or anxiety in other cases it may be a cause. More often than not, it’s the people who are already struggling who are most at risk of developing an addiction.Gambling was something I never sought out: I’d never been in a betting shop, casino or arcade. Instead, through apps on my smartphone, gambling came to me. My experience isn’t unique – more and more women who would never think to enter the all-male spaces of high-street bookies are finding themselves using online gambling sites and apps. Gambling online allowed my addiction to escalate. If you can hide the screen, you can hide the problem.It seemed as if by hitting a few buttons I could “make money”. This promised to become the answer to my debts – another issue I was struggling with at the time. I thought I could win millions and escape somewhere. But the more I chased this hope, the worse the problems I was trying to escape from became. The longer you gamble, the more you lose the more you lose, the more you gamble.The debts began to rack up – to the point that I lost not only my job but my home. That was when I reached rock bottom. The companies I was gambling with didn’t question where I was finding the money. I was never offered a deposit limit that would restrict the amount of money I could spend, self-exclusion for a period of time or support when I began to realise I was struggling with an addiction.I almost lost everything, including my life at my lowest point. As a woman, it somehow felt harder to ask for help: I worried I’d be judged for not being able to cope. Women are usually the ones who hold everything together, and I felt embarrassed that I wasn’t able to. Gambling addiction is still seen as an issue that only affects men. The reality is more and more women are gambling, and we need to raise awareness so they can access support. Specialist services available across the UK aren’t gender specific, they’re available to everyone and most importantly they’re provided for free.At the time, not knowing where to go, I reached out to my GP and was referred to GamCare. Through them I accessed therapy and support that helped me make positive changes to my life. I was able to view my situation from a different perspective, and to understand the aspects of my life that made gambling so attractive. I can now recognise what might trigger me to want to gamble, so I can make a healthier choice for me and my family.There is light at the end of the tunnel if we talk. Talk to one another, talk to your GP, talk to your therapist and talk to an adviser on the national gambling helpline. Rebuilding my life has been tough, but now I have a lovely home again, and I’m the happiest I’ve been in a long time. I’ve finally been honest with my loved ones, and with their ongoing support I’ve said goodbye to gambling for ever.• Free help and advice about problem gambling is available online at BeGambleAware.org or by calling the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133• In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

South Africa’s Durban delivers 320 days of sunshine every year, as well as surfing, foodie adventures and sensational land and sea safariOnce seen as the quiet cousin of cosmopolitan Cape Town and fast-paced Johannesburg, the natural wonders and cultural charms of Durban and its surrounds put it firmly on South Africa’s must-see map. Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.The best place for a first-look at “Durbs” – as the locals call it – is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.Shimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world’s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.With miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa’s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade – try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf – will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.From May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde’s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn’t enough, you can often spot dolphins ing in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time’s environmental research.Oceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you’ll find a neat cross section of the city’s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha’s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.But when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don’t leave without braving the famous “bunny chow”: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You’ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (£4.19).It’s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It’s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.There’s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.A 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You’ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers’ market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa’s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views – of breaching whales and the ocean – but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there’s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.Another 30 minutes’ drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort’s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.South Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours’ drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.Or head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.So now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing’s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.How to bookWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

In summer, when the sap rises, the ants march the aphids up the tree trunk to ensure they are well-fed and can provide the ants with sweet honeydew.Britain has two other species of giant aphid but the pale giant oak aphid was not expected to be found here after it was identified as a new species in central and eastern Europe by mitochondrial DNA analysis in 2012.But photographer and naturalist Julian Hodgson spotted the unusual creature accompanied by several brown ant bodyguards while searching for barkflies in Monks Wood national nature reserve, an ancient woodland near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. Specimens were identified by entomologists in Poland and at the Natural History Museum.Stomaphis wojciechowskii has since been found at five other sites in north-west Cambridgeshire, including Woodwalton Fen and Holme Fen nature reserves.Further analysis suggests the giant aphid is not a new arrival but erged from its central European relatives 30,000 years ago.In the paper reporting its discovery in the British Journal of Entomology and Natural History, Hodgson and his co-authors said it was “short-sighted” that no aphid species had been given formal conservation status or protection in Britain.Shardlow said further work needed to be done to establish the giant aphid’s distribution but it was likely to be rare because the brown ant upon which it is completely dependent is “nationally notable”.“These types of giant aphid are all very special and are rarely seen,” said Shardlow. “Their life history is inspiring and we do need more people to study wild aphids so that we can understand which species are threatened and endangered.“Just because something is an aphid doesn’t mean it can’t be a conservation priority.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3dc95181d849e44a30f9f2fd810ce45dcbdbb18/612_502_3433_2060/master/3433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6da03d54dcabd2aad45fd505273f2855","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, including white-tailed eagles and a detained lion cub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f4fc56daa1b2c47c01ea71f83bac86960e1462e/160_0_2397_1440/master/2397.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c627a8ee4a1eb10281b021ebd4b0297","title":"miss americana review taylor swift netflix documentary","story":"The singer emerges as charming and undeniably talented in this Netflix documentary but it’s too slick for genuine insightIt’s safe to say that by the end of Miss Americana, a quickie documentary on the recent trials and tribulations of Taylor Swift opening this year’s Sundance film festival, few positions will have truly shifted. Those who already idolised the award-winning musician will continue to do so, as will the non-fans who might still begrudgingly admire her undeniable talent. And those who have questioned her knack for playing the victim as well as her lack of self-awareness will also find their minds similarly unchanged. Here is a character study authored by the character who’s being studied, a carefully controlled continuation of a story we have been following now for years. It’s brand management dressed up as insight and while it’s not not entertaining, it’s certainly far from particularly revealing, playing more like a PR exercise than a festival-worthy feature.At the start of the film, as Swift sifts through old journals, she explains that she always needed to “be thought of as good”, and it’s a desire that permeates the film with every possible punch being pulled by director Lana Wilson, whose films have previously focused on hard-hitting topics such as suicide and late-term abortion. It’s not that Swift is in need of a dressing down – far from it – but there are glaring questions left unanswered, avenues left unexplored and a wider perspective sorely missing from her retelling of events.Wilson has unprecedented access to Swift, the kind of intimacy journalists have been craving for years from an artist who has kept herself understandably at arm’s length at specific times of her life. The film follows her throughout her two most recent albums, both spurred by very different motivations, and in what feels like a scattered and confusing timeline we hop back and forth to earlier glimpses of the career that got her to where she now stands, as one of the most famous women in the world. But while Wilson is the credited director, it’s Swift who’s in charge, a masterly musical storyteller transporting that gift to the screen, recounting her life and revealing her personality on her terms. It’s a celebrity profile that’s been sent to the celebrity for approval first.What the film does show, in some of its most charming moments, is Swift’s astonishing talent for music, exemplified in a handful of magnetic studio interludes as we see her create some of her most recent hits. It’s a pleasure to watch her in these scenes, cannily crafting lyrics alongside Jack Antonoff and Max Martin, excitedly working with a tangible enthusiasm. It’s where she truly shines in the film, as events outside the studio often lack depth and objectivity, something that would elevate as well as ground the star’s image. We’re shown that Swift’s lowest point was being interrupted on stage at the VMAs by Kanye West (“It was a catalyst for a lot,” she says), and while his behaviour remains unacceptable, there’s no realisation from her about the reasons that led him there, the ongoing lack of ersity shown by awards bodies and the effect this has had on artists of colour. When Swift talks about the pressure she has always felt as a woman who needed to be seen as nice and compliant, an explanation for her late-stage embrace of politics, we’re never given insight into how she was raised and how her parents played a part in the often regressive view of femininity she has learned to push back against. When Swift briefly mentions her mother’s cancer or her father’s fears for her safety, we never get to hear from either of them, or much from Swift herself.Whenever the documentary threatens to lead us to a place that’s challenging or dark or knotty, such as Swift’s discussion of a previously unrevealed eating disorder, Wilson pulls back. Swift is never challenged by Wilson or by anyone around her. It’s almost exclusively a string of scenes where people agree with her, no matter the subject.The last act pushes Swift as an activist of some stature and while well-intentioned, the congratulatory nature of the film’s view is again lacking in context. Like most of the film it feels like self-mythologising, and while Swift emerges as charming, funny, talented and smart, there’s a grit missing that would have humanised her further. After the premiere Swift spoke about the hours of interview footage the pair recorded and one wonders what was left on the cutting-room floor because this is too slickly selective to feel like a genuine portrait of a woman with fascinating stories to tell.It’s hard to critique Miss Americana as a real film and as one that would even be showing at Sundance in the first place, a festival aimed at shining a light on erse and challenging voices. It’s hard to see it as an independent piece of work from a documentarian and not a talent-approved Netflix featurette. Fans will surely embrace it, and Swift’s brand of feminism and liberalism will definitely be of value to a younger audience, but she remains an enigmatic construct. Like so many documentaries and biopics that have been either produced or authorised by the star at the centre, we’re being shown exactly what they want us to see and there’s something uneasy about what that represents. Swift will remain a deservedly successful singer with a rare talent but we may never get to know her as anything more than that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1280d8b25c673f08d2a9aaf544d9df734ad031d3/0_122_2888_1733/master/2888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eebab2800550adeeebd2afcac6afe0e7","title":"christian eriksen to join inter after tottenham accept 20m offer","story":"Christian Eriksen will travel to Milan and have a medical early next week before completing a move to Internazionale after the Serie A club agreed a €20m (£16.7m) fee with Tottenham for the attacking midfielder.Talks have been ongoing for some time, with Tottenham demanding €20m from the outset and in the end the chairman, Daniel Levy, got what he wanted for a player who has been with the club since 2013 and had six months on his contract.Inter offered €15m plus add-ons at the beginning of this week but when the clubs met on Friday they struck a deal.

Hopefully with more luck than the avid Liverpool fan Mullin had trying to attend United’s visit to Anfield last weekend. Going toe-to-toe with Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s fragile team on Sunday offers ample compensation.“That and Barcelona last season are the only games in two years I haven’t been able to get a ticket for,” lamented the 25-year-old, who was in the same Liverpool youth team as Raheem Sterling before their careers took very different paths.The Liverpool fan in Mullin requires no extra incentive to increase United’s problems but his priority is to give Rovers supporters another lift in what has been a trying league campaign. “I want to do it for the fans here,” he said. “They’re the ones who come to support us every week. The Tranmere fans don’t care about Liverpool. They come no matter how we are doing.”After two consecutive promotions from the National League to League One, and having lost last season’s leading goalscorer, James Norwood, on a free to Ipswich last summer, the acceleration of Micky Mellon’s team has stalled. Tranmere are third from bottom of League One but the FA Cup has provided a release. For Mullin, who scored the late equaliser that completed Tranmere’s comeback from three goals down in the first meeting with Watford, United’s visit is also reward for refusing to give up after the heartache of being released by Liverpool at 16.The forward, who returned to Merseyside via spells with Huddersfield, Morecambe and Swindon, said: “When you’re a kid that’s your dream and you think your whole world has fallen apart. But now I’ve been given a career as a footballer and to get the chance to play against Manchester United, one of the biggest teams in the world, is a great feeling. I will try to express myself and score.”Mullin impressed after replacing the tireless Morgan Ferrier against Watford, with both strikers picking up knocks in the replay, and believes the Prenton Park pitch could have an influence against United. “It’s not in great condition,” he said. “Everyone can see that and knows that. Manchester United are all fantastic players and the best there is but to come here it is 11 v 11 and we will make it as hard as we can for them. Hopefully we can get something.Mellon’s assistant, Michael Jackson, was at Old Trafford on Wednesday for United’s 2-0 defeat by Burnley and at Anfield on Sunday for Liverpool’s victory by the same scoreline. “Not because we believed we were going to go through against Watford,” the manager explained. “We were just being professional.”That approach, and possibly the memory of last season’s 7-0 thrashing by Tottenham in round three, led Mellon to dismiss talk of United’s vulnerability. But their appearance at Prenton Park will, he hopes, generate the revenue needed to improve Rovers’ squad in their fight to remain in League One.The Tranmere manager said: “It should give us the opportunity to strengthen. We know we need to strengthen. We didn’t really have the ability to do that before because we are not lashed with loads of money. So hopefully now it should give us the opportunity to build on something and we can only build on it by bringing in quality players into the group.“I’m sure we’ll be able to do that and that is the right way to go to keep building this club and give them nights like Watford because that is what it is all about. Thursday was a massive night for us for a whole host of reasons.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/738269c2bf8d8a041b6b2fe185fa0250a7db50e2/0_17_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cab3735f5b25618b84371e899540389a","title":"do you love doing the same thing over and over heres why it doesnt make you boring","story":"We don’t always need new distractions – there’s a value to experiencing something more than onceOne of the less-noticed mysteries of human psychology is how many everyday activities we don’t seem to find boring. If you have a regular pub or favourite country walk, or you’re prone to listening to certain songs 20 times on repeat, you’d appear to be violating the principle of “hedonic adaptation”, which holds that, as pleasures grow familiar they stop delivering joy. After all, evolution designed us to find novelty compelling – on the prehistoric savannah, new things posed more threats, and opportunities, than old – and the modern economy relentlessly exploits this fact. People who prefer repeat experiences are liable to incur disdain. Maybe it’s forgivable, given the state of the news, that I’ve been re-rereading Sherlock Holmes recently, instead of current affairs, or cutting-edge literary fiction. But you probably wouldn’t say it was admirable. Ultimately, it feels like retreating from reality.So I was pleased to encounter new research by Ed O’Brien of the University of Chicago, which might prompt a rethink on the matter. O’Brien exposed people to new experiences (movies, museum visits, videogames) then asked some of them to predict how much they’d enjoy the same thing again, while others actually did do it again. To cut a long study short: people enjoy repeat experiences more than they predict they will. And not because they use the sameness to lull themselves into a comfortable trance, but because they discover new things they’d missed first time around. As O’Brien put it: “Doing something once may engender an inflated sense that one has now seen ‘it’, leaving people naive to the missed nuances remaining to enjoy.” It’s less a question of loving the familiar, then, than of discovering it wasn’t so familiar after all.When you relate to everyday life in this spirit, you begin to grasp what the writer Sam Harris means when he says that “boredom is always just a lack of attention”. There’s always more to find in any experience, and boredom is simply what happens when, out of impatience or distraction, you stop looking for it. (Or as GK Chesterton wrote: “There is no such thing on earth as an uninteresting subject the only thing that can exist is an uninterested person.”) Harris attributes this insight to meditation, which makes sense: anyone who meditates for a while comes to know the intense fascination that can be aroused by something as apparently dull and repetitious as the breath. And if breathing can be freshly interesting every time you do it, there’s no reason why a walk to the shop on the corner – let alone a hike in the hills – shouldn’t feel like the trip of a lifetime.In his new book The Tao Of Ordinariness, psychologist Robert Wickes argues that in a world geared to novelty and specialness, it takes determination merely to be who we really are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d77c9a350bd77478321525a09eed8cc6af38f3/0_517_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcc7368196d4b681607e118575c12f79","title":"how has your workplace treated bereaved parents","story":"As paid leave for bereaved parents is being introduced under Jack’s Law, we want to hear what parents experienced at work after they lost a childBereaved parents are now entitled to two weeks’ paid leave from work under the new Jack’s Law.We want to hear from bereaved parents who had to juggle the grief, trauma and practicalities of their child’s death with the demands of their employers.

It takes a certain someone to love Romney Marsh. That someone happens to be me. Many will gaze at its landscape of squelchy flat fields, sluice gates and forlorn, atmospheric villages, and run for the hills, as they did for centuries. Some, though, will find them all impossibly romantic and fabulously attractive. The neighbourhood did seem to attract those certain someones: Noel Coward, for instance, or Edith Nesbit, seeking escape in a spot lifted above the day-to-day in its own existential universe. It’s hard to fathom exactly where Romney Marsh gets its particular character from. Its history of malarial marshes and smugglers’ haunts hangs about like a miasma. The blank landscape is peppered with remote medieval villages, astonishing churches, such as at Fairfield, built on the riches of the wool trade, and flat-faced postwar bungalows, staring out to sea. Or perhaps it’s this landscape’s own peculiar geographical history that is so attractive, its sense of temporariness, of the mastery of nature. The fortunes of Romney Marsh and its inhabitants have risen and fallen with the tides, and the accumulation of silt and shingle.

I found myself entertaining a recurring daydream of escaping from time. I would be hustling my son out the door to get him to school, or walking briskly to work on the day of a deadline, or castigating myself for being online when I should have been methodically and efficiently putting words on paper, and I would have this vision of myself as a character in a video game discovering a secret level. This vision was informed by the platform games I loved as a child – Super Mario Bros, Sonic the Hedgehog and so on – in which the character you controlled moved across the screen from left to right through a scrolling landscape, encountering obstacles and adversaries as you progressed to the end of the level. In this daydream, I would see myself pushing against a wall or lowering myself down the yawning mouth of a pipe, and thereby discovering this secret level, this hidden chamber where I could exist for a time outside of time, where the clock was not forever running down to zero.My relationship with time had always been characterised by a certain baleful anxiety, but as I approached the start of the decade in which I would have no choice but to think of myself as middle-aged, this anxiety intensified. I was always in the middle of some calculation or quantification with respect to time, and such thoughts were always predicated on an understanding of it as a precious and limited resource. What time was it right now? How much time was left for me to do the thing I was doing, and when would I have to stop doing it to do the next thing?This resource being as limited as it was, should I not be doing something better with it, something more urgent or interesting or authentic? At some point in my late 30s, I recognised the paradoxical source of this anxiety: that every single thing in life took much longer than I expected it to, except for life itself, which went much faster, and would be over before I knew where I was.Much of this had to do with being a parent. Having two young children had radically altered my relationship with the days and hours of my life. Almost every moment was accounted for in a way that it had never been before. But it was also the sheer velocity of change, the state of growth and flux in which my children existed, and the constant small adjustments that were necessary to accommodate these changes. I would realise that my son no longer mispronounced a particular word in that adorable way he once had, or that his baby sister had stopped doing that thing of nodding very seriously and emphatically when she heard a song she liked – that she was, in fact, no longer a baby at all – and that those eras had now passed for good, along with countless others that would pass unnoticed and unremembered, and I would feel sad and remorseful about not having lived more fully in those moments, not having stopped or at least slowed the flow of time. And when I felt this way, I would succumb to the daydream of the video game, the secret level, the escape from time itself.My son turned six around then, itself a significant milestone in that he was, for the first time, at an age I myself could dimly remember being. And with this new phase of parenthood, I began to think how strange it was, given how precious those early years now seemed to me, that I spent so little time thinking about my own childhood, the lost civilisation on which my adult self now stood. The motion of the video game unfurled rightward, and I had no choice but to follow its motion towards the future, towards the completion of the game itself.And then one day, about a week and a half before I turned 40, I found myself alone in a forest in Devon, where I discovered this secret level of my daydreams.Here is how I did it: I came to a clearing in a forest by a riverbank in Dartmoor national park, far enough from any trail that it seemed unlikely I would encounter anyone while I was there. I gathered some loose branches and stones and arranged them in a circle of about 10 metres in diameter, and then I walked into the circle and did not leave it until the same time the following day.The short version of this story is that nothing happened in that time: that I did nothing and witnessed nothing, experienced only the passage of the hours and minutes, and the languid dynamics of my own boredom. The long version isn’t exactly The Iliad, either, but in that version something could be said to have happened. Because by the time I walked out of that circle the following afternoon, I’d had an entirely unexpected and intensely cathartic encounter with the passage of time, and with my own mortality.This is a practice commonly referred to as a “wilderness solo”. The basic principle is that you go out into nature, the wilder and more remote the better, and confine yourself to one very small area for a set period – a day, two days, three days, sometimes longer. During this period, you forego anything that might come between yourself and your own solitude. No phone. No books or other reading material. You don’t build a fire, because building a fire is a way to keep yourself busy, watching the dance of its flames a primitive entertainment. Most participants choose not to bring food, because when you have got nothing to do for a day and a night, the prospect of eating a sandwich can easily become an all-encompassing preoccupation, undermining the entire project of unmediated communion with nature. After that period of immersion, you step outside of your circle, and you re-enter the world.Until fairly recently, I was not a person who had a lot of time for nature. I wished it well in all its dealings, and was glad to take its side in any quarrel with the forces arrayed against it, but my regard for it was essentially abstract, and I would just as soon have left it to its own devices. Nature was something I encountered as scenery, an experience to be consumed before getting back in the car and continuing on my way. But about the middle of 2016, amid the endlessly unfurling horrors of that year’s news, I became increasingly preoccupied with how this darkening political reality seemed to foreshadow a near future defined by a permanent state of climate emergency. And these things felt connected in some way that resisted easy definition: the speed and efficiency with which technology was gutting democracy and alienating us from the reality of human suffering, and the increasing extremity of our estrangement from the natural world. I was thinking all the time about climate change, about the future my children would be forced to live in, about what we had done and were continuing to do to the world. But at some point it dawned on me that I didn’t know the first thing about that world. What I knew was the great indoors in which I lived my life: the insides of buildings, the insides of books, the interlocking interiors of the internet and my own mind. When I talked about nature, I didn’t know what I meant. In a way that was somehow both vague and urgent, I felt that it was time to go outside.I came across an organisation called Way of Nature UK that arranged group wilderness retreats, and I signed up for a trip. This was how, in the spring of 2017, I ended up spending a week with a group of about 20 other people in a remote wilderness reserve called Alladale in the Scottish Highlands, towards the end of which everyone went off to various locations and did a solo. How did I feel about sitting by a river for 24 hours and doing absolutely nothing, aside from looking at grass and clouds and water and so on? I felt slightly intimidated. I felt uncomfortable. I felt, above all, reflexively cynical, in the way that I was reflexively cynical about pretty much anything that felt new-agey or hippyish or otherwise overly earnest to me. But over the course of that week, and in particular the 24 hours I spent alone by the river, that brittle carapace of cynicism began to give way. What affected me most deeply about that time alone in nature was the aspect of it I had initially been most daunted by. The experience of the solo is the experience of time itself, in its rawest and most unmediated form.When I stepped into that ad-hoc ceremonial circle in Devon last summer, it had been over a year since I had performed the ritual, and I found myself craving the solitude and immersion it provided.Andres Roberts, Way of Nature’s co-founder, picked me up that morning outside my hotel in Bristol, near where he lives. I had got to know him pretty well on the two previous trips I had done with him, and my new enthusiasm for spending time alone in nature had been informed by his quietly ecstatic way of talking about the wilderness. As we drove south along the M5 through intermittent downpours of rain, he spoke about his work, and the ideas underpinning it. If there was a single word that encapsulated the value he was trying to incubate, that word was “slowness”. There was an extraordinary transformative power, he insisted, in the practice of sitting and doing nothing, and thereby slowing your mind and body to a meditative rhythm in nature.One of Roberts’s major themes was the idea that our particular civilisation, at our particular time, was unusual in not having as part of its cultural repertoire some ritual whereby during periods of change or upheaval people went out alone into nature. When he talked about the practice of the wilderness solo, he talked about it in such terms – as a ritual whereby you stepped out of the flux of the world, in order to gain some perspective on the flux, and your place within it.A word he used a lot in talking about his work, and in describing the experience and value of the nature solo, was “re-enchantment”. He was of the opinion that most people, most of the time, lived life in a state of disenchantment. What he wanted to do, above all, was to help people strip away the layers of hard rationalism that accrued around the adult mind, so that they could return to a more childlike engagement with the world. And in reaching this state, he said, this place of re-enchantment, we could come to see ourselves not as separate from and in control of nature, but as part of it.It was harder than anticipated, finding a solo spot. We had settled on Dartmoor for its proximity to Bristol and its relatively humane weather outlook, but it was not a place with which Roberrts was particularly familiar. We followed at first a northward trail, planning to cross a footbridge into deeper forest on the far side of the river, but when we eventually found it, the gate to the footbridge was firmly padlocked.Further along the trail we met a man out for a walk with his dog. Early 70s, bearded, wax jacketed, he wore the dog’s lead draped athwart himself shoulder to hip in the manner of a mayoral sash. Roberts asked him whether there was a bridge we could cross further on. He shook his head and courteously informed us, in a Devonshire accent as soft and mulchy as the ground beneath our feet, that we were on land privately owned by one of his neighbours, and that the more densely forested territory across the river was private, too, and that we technically required a permit to walk this trail.We turned and strolled back with him toward the road, and as he chatted to us about the cottage he and his wife had recently renovated, and their troubles with the local conservation society who disapproved of their alterations to the property, I was struck by how easily the concept of private land ownership could be made to feel absurd. It seemed perfectly rational in towns and cities, in housing estates and apartment buildings, for people to own their little portions of the world. But here, on the flourishing banks of a torrential river, the thought that this place was the sole property of some mere person – that that person could own the deeds to a river bank or a forest – seemed deeply and disorientingly counterintuitive, in a way that threatened to undermine the whole spirit of our enterprise. It felt impossible, as I put it to Roberts after we parted company with the man, to pursue the kind of immersive experience of a place we were after when you worried you might be trespassing.He reassured me, though, that we would find a suitable place for my solo, on commonly owned land where I wouldn’t have to worry about some local squire coming along and telling me I had no business having an immersive experience with his privately owned nature.We found another trail, running northward along the River Dart. Roberts lowered his voice to not much more than a whisper, eventually stopping talking altogether, and slowed his pace so that I was walking well ahead of him. I understood this deliberate minimisation of his own presence to mean that we had entered a kind of buffer zone between the outside world and the solo space. This was one of the great charms of how he worked without his having seemed to do anything very specific, you were made to understand that some ritual was underway, that you were somehow in the midst of the sacred.The point of being here is to be here. An hour or two into my time in the forest, I wrote these words in my notebook, and drew a box around them to emphasise their authority and self-sufficiency. And then I stopped writing words in my notebook altogether, because writing words is my work, and I was wary of taking an utilitarian approach to the solo. The point of being there, after all, was to be there. (The cynical reader might argue that the point of being there was to write about being there – an argument the cynical writer will, on balance, concede, if only to avoid getting bogged down in the ontological complexities of the whole relationship between experiencing things and writing about them.)And what did I do, while I was being there, in the forest, by the river? Nothing, more or less. The first half hour or so, there was a certain amount of housekeeping to attend to. I had to find exactly the right spot: not too damp flat enough to pitch a tent once night began to fall sheltered from the elements, but not so sheltered as to obscure the view of the river and the far bank. I had to mark out the circle, of course. I had to gather flat stones and sticks and bits of branches, and arrange them around a beech tree I had chosen as the central feature of my location. It could, I suppose, have been an oak tree, or an elm, or some other type of lofty deciduous of which I, being no Robert MacFarlane, had no prior knowledge.But once all that was out of the way, I had to confront that fact of having nothing to do. In theory, I should have greeted this experience with open arms. I had, in fact, been looking forward to it for weeks – to having no tasks to attend to, no places to go, no obligations to meet. Here I was with nothing to do but inhabit the spaciousness of every passing moment, to bathe at leisure in the pooled flow of time itself. In theory, it was the dream. In practice, if I could have taken out my phone and gone on Twitter I surely would have. (Thankfully, this possibility was foreclosed to me by the fact of having no mobile coverage. In any case, I’d stowed my phone in my backpack in order to stop myself violating the spirit of the wilderness solo by spending the whole time looking through photos of my children, or opening up the New Yorker app and immersing myself not in nature, but in back issues of a magazine I never had the time to read, for reasons gestured at above.)When you’re actually in it, the reality of the solo is, at least at first, one of total boredom. I cannot stress enough how little there is to do when you have confined yourself to the inside of a small circle of stones and sticks in a forest. But it is an instructive kind of boredom, insofar as boredom is the raw and unmediated experience of time. It is considered best practice not to have a watch, and to turn off your phone and keep it somewhere in the bottom of a bag so as to avoid the temptation to constantly check how long you’ve been out and how long you have left. And as you become untethered from your accustomed orientation in time – from always knowing what time it is, how long you have to do the thing you’re doing, when you have to stop doing it to do the next thing – you begin to glimpse a new perspective on the anxiety that arises from that orientation. Because this anxiety, which amounts to a sort of cost-benefit analysis of every passing moment, is a quintessentially modern predicament.As weirdly counterintuitive as it feels to acknowledge, human beings are not naturally predisposed to think of life in terms of seconds and hours, of how they might be optimised. The development of mechanical clocks during the middle ages and, later, the advent of widespread precision timekeeping that facilitated the industrial revolution, fundamentally changed the way in which the human animal related to the world. Time became both an abstraction and a commodity, a raw material to be bought and sold, saved or squandered.The mass adoption of this new conception of time, abstract and removed from the organic context of nature, was central to the rise of capitalism, and to the accelerating mechanisation of life. “Beginning in the 14th century,” as the American cultural critic Neil Postman put it, “the clock made us into time-keepers, and then time-savers, and now time-servers. In the process, we have learned irreverence toward the sun and the seasons, for in a world made up of seconds and minutes, the authority of nature is superseded.” To sit by a river for a day and a night is to experience the reinstatement, if only temporarily, of that authority.What did I do, sitting in that forest? I drank a lot of water, because I had brought a lot of water, and drinking it was, if only in the most basic of senses, something to do. And because I drank a lot of water, I took a great many resulting pisses around the far side of the tree, and this too presented something to do, however minor. I would occasionally treat myself to a bit of a stand, or even a little stroll around my circle, but mostly I was content to sit propped against my backpack with my legs spread before me on the soft carpet of leaves. I spent a lot of time looking at those leaves: holding them up to the light, observing the delicate webbings, the desiccated veins, crumbling them slowly between my fingers. This, I admit, was only slightly more interesting than doing nothing at all.The tree, in time, became a central object of my attention. I can’t say how long I spent standing in front of its trunk, staring at its covering of bright green moss, its gnarled protuberances of bark, but it must have been at least an hour. The moss was leafy, and felt both delicate and spongily resilient beneath my hand, and the longer I stared at it, the more I came to feel that I was gazing downward from a great height at a forest, that the moss was a canopy of leaves and the bark the ground beneath. The surface of the tree was its own ecosystem, expansive and intricate, and when I looked closely enough I saw that there were tiny insects everywhere, spiders and other many-legged creatures, whom I imagined living out their days aware of no other world than that little vastness, that forest within a forest.My own incapacity to give this tree a name seemed suddenly strange to me, and slightly sad. In the ordinary run of things, if I were curious enough about what kind of tree I was looking at, I would have just gone on Google, or downloaded one of those tree-recognising apps, but this option was not available to me. Then it occurred to me that there was something about the not knowing that was somehow right. Not having a human name to give the tree, a category in which to put it, made the tree more real and present to me than it otherwise would have, or so I allowed myself to believe.At some point it came to my attention that I was no longer bored, and that I had not been bored for some time. This is not to say that I was in a state of high mental stimulation, but that the hours of inactivity had induced in me a kind of meditative stupor, whereby I was receptive to the information of the environment – to the ceaseless clamour of the river, the chattering of the birds overhead, the urgent whisperings of the leaves in the breeze, the modulations of temperature and light – but uninclined to think much about this information, or anything else. I had, I realised, become attuned to the frequencies of the forest. I had found the secret level.This is a thing that has happened to me whenever I have been alone in nature for an extended period: there occurs, some hours in, a subtle but profound modulation in consciousness whereby I come to experience myself as part of the place I am in, as an organism among organisms. This is a state of mind in which I can watch a small spider crawl along my arm for many minutes, feeling a kind of sentimental fellowship with this busy, delicate creature, whom in the normal run of things I would not hesitate to brush off in irritation or disgust.In these moments, I find myself thinking of the place itself as somehow conscious of my presence. To be alone in a forest, and to be thinking of the forest as somehow aware of you: I will acknowledge that this sounds like the very substance of nightmare, but, in fact, it is a strangely beautiful and quietly moving experience, and I think it must be what people mean when they talk about intuiting the presence of God.The word that comes to mind is immanence – a term I learned as a philosophy undergraduate and which I did not remotely understand until I began to have these experiences of being alone in nature. In his 1836 essay Nature, American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson identifies precisely this sublime phenomenon. “The greatest delight which the fields and woods minister,” he writes, “is the suggestion of an occult relation between man and the vegetable. I am not alone and unacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them.” It’s a phenomenon that he views as both an apprehension of the ine and a return to the child’s perception of the world. “In the woods,” he writes, “a man casts off his years, as the snake his slough, and at what period soever of life, is always a child.”I am struck now by how strongly these lines of Emerson – these ideas of casting off years, of attaining the spirit of early childhood – resonate with the strangest and most unsettling and, in the end, most wonderful aspect of my experience in the woods. While I was there, I didn’t spend much time thinking about reaching 40, and whatever lay beyond. What I thought about was the distant past of my own childhood, which I spent in the countryside, in a house beside a small wood with a little stream running through it: a tamely arcadian surrounding which provided the setting for countless imagined adventures, battles and voyages. Something about sitting alone among the trees, looking at the river, put me in mind of that period of my life. The fact of having all this time now, and nothing to do with it the slow process by which intense boredom had given way to a kind of absent-minded and playful immersion: these were things I associated with my own childhood. I remembered what Andres Roberts had said about re-enchantment, about time in nature as a means of returning to a more childlike engagement with the world.And then for a long time I thought about my son, of how he existed in a thin space between reality and fantasy. I thought of how attached he was to his favourite toy, a small brown rabbit he carried everywhere with him, clutched in the crook of an arm, of how real and alive that rabbit was to him. This was in my mind because the previous evening, as I had unpacked at my hotel, I saw that my wife had slipped among my camping things a stuffed rabbit I myself had been deeply attached to when I was small. She had found it on a recent visit to my parents’ house, where it had been lying around for years in my childhood bedroom. That rabbit, with its floppy long limbs and its black button eyes and its faded blue dungarees, had been as real to me, as invested with surplus love, as my son’s stuffed rabbit now was to him. I thought of how soon – a year from now, or maybe less – my son’s rabbit would stop being real to him, how soon his world would lose the magic he himself had breathed into it.And I thought with a pang of how I was always hurrying him – to get dressed, to get out the door for school, to finish his dinner, to get ready for bed – and of how heedlessly I was inflicting upon him my own anxious awareness of time as an oppressive force. How before he knew where he was, his own childhood would have receded into the past, and he too would be out of the secret level of childhood and into the laterally scrolling world of adulthood.As the sun was going down in Dartmoor, I put up my tent and, in the dwindling light of the forest, rummaged in my backpack for my head-mounted torch. Inside the backpack, my hand encountered again the familiar softness of the stuffed rabbit. I held the toy a moment, smiled again at this touching and witty gesture of my wife’s, and then decided to take a photo of it to send to her when I had mobile coverage the following day. I propped the rabbit against the outer lining of the tent and turned away to rummage again in my bag for my phone, and when I turned back I was overcome by a shock of recognition. I was seeing the rabbit not as I had seen it a moment before, as an intriguing relic of the submerged civilisation of my childhood, but as I had seen it as a small boy.The rabbit was entirely alive to me in that moment. It was as though all the love I had invested in this object in those days was still contained within it, within him, and the experience of its sudden animation was overwhelming. I was looking at the rabbit, and the rabbit was looking at me, and it was seeing me, and I was both myself and the child I had once been. Whatever complex of emotions I was feeling was neither sentimental nor nostalgic in character, but powerfully existential. I felt simultaneously closer to myself as a child than I had in all the years of adulthood, and yet that sudden closeness came as an experience of loss, of immeasurable distance. It was as though time had folded in on itself, and the present was touching the past. There I was, as close to 40 as made no difference, alone in a forest on a moonless night and weeping with cathartic abandon at the sight of a threadbare stuffed animal. I was mourning my childhood, and the mourning felt long overdue.I woke early, and lay still for a time listening to water dropping from the branches and leaves onto the outer layer of my tent. I had slept more soundly than I had expected, given the hard ground beneath me and the mummifying strictures of the sleeping bag. The absolute darkness and solitude had aroused neither loneliness nor unease. I had felt strangely at home with the sounds and silences of the forest at night.Until very recently, the idea of spending a rainy morning alone in a forest would have been a profoundly unattractive one, but I found myself relishing the prospect of these last hours. The restlessness I had experienced the previous day, in that last stretch of the solo, was entirely absent now, the question of what to do with myself for several hours having come to seem nowhere near as pressing. The idea of such a question felt, in fact, somehow absurd. I went to the edge of my circle and sat down, and looked at the river.You would have thought that I’d have been more or less done with looking at the river by now, but in fact I was eager to get stuck into it again after the long night-time hours of not looking at the river. In terms of the ersions that were presently available to me, looking at the river was the hottest ticket in town. And so I sat there at the edge of my little circle on the riverbank and binge-watched the river. There is, it turns out, a lot going on at any one time in a river, especially if you’ve got nothing else to be looking at.There were birds coming and going all the time, skimming low over the water and landing on the banks. There was the occasional ambiguous shape flitting on the periphery of my vision that may well have been some kind of leaping fish. I attended in particular to a bit of river directly in front of me where the water plunged low into a sort of miniature waterfall, immediately after which it appeared to run backward into itself, a phenomenon I couldn’t begin to try to account for, but for which the most likely culprit seemed to be gravity. I stared at this spectacle for so long that a kind of optical illusion began to assert itself, whereby when I glanced up at the opposite bank, the long grass and drooping ferns seemed themselves to be engaged in sympathetic movements, swirling impossibly before my eyes. It could have been the effect of hours of meditative inactivity, or it could just have been hunger, but there was something mildly trippy about the experience.Around noon, I heard a gently insistent bird call coming from a little way upriver. I turned toward it, and saw Roberts standing not far off with his back against a tree trunk, making an owl sound with his hands cupped to his mouth. I gathered my things, and we walked in silence out of the forest, him keeping several paces behind me. This seemed both entirely deliberate and entirely natural, and its effect was to preserve a measure of my solitude as I gradually emerged from the circle, out of the secret level and back into time.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2763f0efa8c50f2ec6b8255405575b2fc09d7/62_582_1513_908/master/1513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb313e9571496990d6b5c3439fc2b017","title":"zoe brock my case against harvey weinstein podcast","story":"Like dozens of women in the entertainment industry, the actor, model and writer Zoë Brock has claimed she had a traumatic encounter with the film producer Harvey Weinstein.

His mother, who had come to the UK from Tanzania and worked in a factory in Huddersfield before moving to the capital, was friends with many of the plant’s mostly female east African Asian employees.The Grunwick dispute – which saw its participants dubbed “strikers in saris” by the media – lasted two years, with 550 arrests. “The back of the house overlooked the picket line, so there was no question of whether or not to support the strike. It was literally on our doorstep,” said Desai, who is now a London assembly member for the city and east constituency.Desai, who became a Labour councillor in Newham in 1998, described the dispute as marking the beginning of his political awakening. He remembers the miners travelling from Yorkshire to join the picket line and support the striking women – two parts of the Labour movement coming together in their shared interests. “They are such iconic images,” he said. “Asian women, very short in stature, with all these Yorkshire miners. There were hundreds of people there.”In the wake of Labour’s crushing election defeat, the apparatus that supported that alliance appears to be hanging by a thread. In the postmortem that followed the loss of seats across the so-called “red wall” of de-industrialised areas in the north of England and the Midlands that had voted Labour for generations, one idea has gained traction: that the party has lost touch with its “traditional base” of white working-class voters by pandering to the metropolitan elite. In that conversation, many fear, another part of Labour’s “traditional base” – the working-class black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) voters living in seats that are every bit as much a part of Labour’s “heartland” as the red wall – has been forgotten.“The question is, what are Labour heartlands?” said Rohit Dasgupta, an academic and Labour councillor in Newham in east London. “Is it just places like Bury and Hartlepool, or is it also places like inner London boroughs, like Newham and Hackney? These are also Labour heartlands. Lots of Labour’s core vote comes from here, and there are sizeable BAME communities who vote Labour. I think it feels almost like some people within the party take the BAME vote for granted.”Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director at the race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, argues that in their desperation to find a way to win back the red wall, some in the party risk falling for a rightwing narrative that pitches white and BAME communities against each other. “The right have put forward the argument that the reason white working-class people are being neglected is because advantages and privileges and focus and attention have gone on ethnic minorities,” she said.“But that’s not the case. All working-class interests, white and BAME, have been neglected by politicians. In fact research has shown that ethnic minorities have lost out from austerity policies much more, in the same way that women have lost out more in comparison to men. The economic problems of white working-class groups in the north are not due to migrants or to black and ethnic minority people one group has not lost out at the expense of the other,” she said. “It’s not a zero-sum game.”The debates surrounding the Labour leadership race have so far focused on the question of which candidate would be best placed to win back support from white working-class communities, with many arguing that the next leader should be a northerner. Pundits responded to the rumour that the Tottenham MP David Lammy could run for leader by suggesting he would not be the best person to reconnect with the party’s “patriotic heartlands”. In all of this, some activists have argued, Labour risks repeating the mistake it made with those “red wall” seats with the places that now form its last stronghold.Researchers from Class conducted focus groups with nearly 80 people in London and found “significant overlap in everyday lived experiences” of white working-class and minority ethnic or migrant working-class people. The four main themes were a feeling of a lack of power and a voice concern over the precariousness of their living conditions experience of class and race prejudice and a resentment at the loss of community space.While Will Jennings at the Centre for Towns thinktank is clear that Labour’s loss of support in certain white working-class communities is a problem the party needs to address if it is ever to achieve power again, he said that did not mean it should disregard other parts of its coalition.“We haven’t seen yet the data from the British election study, so we can’t be absolutely sure how people voted, but we do know that Labour’s vote tends to do better in areas with more ethnic minorities,” he said. “You can’t get around the fact that Labour has seen its vote fall most sharply in areas that were leave voting and, by composition, had fewer ethnic minorities.“Labour should be concerned about why it lost support in those places and the feelings of economic distress felt in those places – people being discontented with politics and concerned by social change – but that doesn’t mean that it should disregard other parts of its electoral coalition.”Many of them also live in the constituencies that are at the heart of the discussion. “The erasure of ethnic minorities in the north and Midlands is quite astonishing,” said Haque. “In many constituencies you wouldn’t have got that Brexit vote if it wasn’t for ethnic minorities also voting Brexit.“They talk about a select number of areas like the Bolsovers and the Sedgefields and the Bishop Aucklands, but they’re not talking about the Oldhams, the Bradford Easts, the Stoke-on-Trents. They have a substantial number of ethnic minorities, but they just get erased. People just talk about the white working-class Brexit voter.”Desai said he often thinks about an experience his mother had two days into her job working in a factory in Huddersfield. “It was the first time she had seen snow and she had a bad fall. The largely white female workforce came running out to help. They made her a hot drink and clubbed together to get a taxi for her to go home, saying they would explain to management what had happened.“There was quite a lot of racism in west Yorkshire at the time, but that showed the commonality of the working class. My mother still remembers that incident to this day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08f35dd5754d603cf5c9ff67020ef06428c3007e/0_178_2640_1585/master/2640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39a9682d6922a50bc65430fd54c360ae","title":"revealed complex post brexit checks for northern irish traders","story":"Transport and manufacturing heads criticise paperwork needed to trade with GBThe “straightforward” document that Northern Irish businesses will need to complete to send goods to Great Britain after Brexit is a complex form that includes 31 data elements, it can be revealed.The Freight Transport Association has raised concerns that hauliers could be fined if they get elements of the “exit summary declaration” wrong, and is calling on the EU and the UK to remove it during their negotiations.The FTA’s head of European policy, Pauline Bastidon, said: “There are up to 31 data elements in an exit summary declaration required to take goods out of the EU now and post-Brexit (ie out of Northern Ireland) when the mode is road freight. Only two of these are optional, meaning 29 data elements are mandatory.Stephen Barclay came under fire late last year when, as Brexit secretary, he revealed the forms would be required even though it is a domestic trade route.The news infuriated the Democratic Unionist party, which had been promised there would be no border down the Irish Sea, and was swiftly downplayed by Barclay, who told the DUP MP Nigel Dodds days later that it was a “fairly straightforward” form.Days later Boris Johnson was accused of misleading the public when he told business leaders on a visit to Northern Ireland that they could throw the form in the bin.The exit and entry forms are mandatory and are the two parts of what is known as a safety and security certificate. It is required as part of a counter-terrorism regime devised to protect the US after the 911 attacks but is not applicable within the European Union. After Brexit, it will apply in Northern Ireland and on trade moving from Great Britain to the rest of the EU.Businesses sending goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will not be immune either. They face a form involving up to 45 elements. “Only three of these are optional, meaning that 42 data fields are mandatory,” Bastidon said.The legal basis of the forms is contained in a complex 557-page document, which is almost incomprehensible to an untrained eye.Transport chiefs and manufacturers must match codes in the document with a complex list of coded data every time goods are booked on to a ferry.Seamus Lehany, the head of the FTA in Belfast, said: “It’s the haulier who must complete the paperwork. The concern is if a mistake is made and a load refused onboard a ferry, it could then miss its sailing which would have a big impact on ‘just in time’ loads, especially for the retail trade.”Stephen Kelly, the chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland, said the checks breached the commitments made in Irish border clauses 49 and 50 in the UK and EU joint report 2017, and that “the EU were as much to blame” as the prime minister.Senior staff at Dover Port said they were also worried. They have previously said the requirement for counter-terror security declarations posed the biggest threat to frictionless trade with the EU.“The security certificate is our biggest worry,” one source said.The EU’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is to visit Belfast on Monday.His adviser Stefaan de Rynck said the EU would “not tolerate any backsliding or half measures” on the Northern Ireland protocol, and that the UK could face sanctions if it did not implement all three sets of checks: “safety and security”, customs and regulatory checks.“There are clear commitments on the UK which are legally binding and have to be implemented,” he told an audience in London on Wednesday.No government department has supplied details on the declarations since Barclay mentioned them in October despite businesses calling for more information.Instead, Johnson has been saying there will be no checks, and this week in parliament he told the DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson there would “emphatically” be no checks in either direction on goods.Business leaders from 12 sectoral organisations have called for the EU to waive the safety and security certificate and to minimise the customs and regulatory checks.Bastidon said: “The safety and security certificates can be done away with if both sides agree.”De Rynck pointed out that security certificates were not required on goods between Switzerland and the EU but that was because there was alignment on EU rules, something the chancellor, Sajid Javid, has ruled out.• This article was amended on 24 January 2020.

We start a new chapter as partners and allies.”Von der Leyen tweeted: “Charles Michel and I have just signed the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, opening the way for its ratification by the European parliament.”The signed copy of the agreement was sent in a diplomatic bag to Downing Street for the prime minister’s signature. On Thursday the withdrawal agreement received royal assent from the Queen.The document, which runs to nearly 600 pages, includes agreements on citizens’ rights, the UK’s £33bn worth of financial obligations to the bloc and the Northern Ireland protocol, establishing the arrangements for maintaining an open border on the island of Ireland.The European parliament’s constitutional affairs committee backed the agreement on Thursday by 23 votes to three, setting up the final act next week when a plenary session of the EU parliament will vote to ratify the deal.Under the agreement, the UK will leave the EU at midnight central European time on 31 January. The UK will remain in the EU’s single market and customs union, but none of the decision-making bodies, until the end of 2020.Boris Johnson has said he will not take the option available to him in the withdrawal agreement of extending this transition period. The prime minister has said the 11-month period available without further extension is “ample” time to reach agreement on a comprehensive deal.The EU’s negotiating position, known as a mandate, is due to be adopted on 25 February by EU ministers attending a general affairs council, and formal negotiations will then begin on the future relationship.A political declaration on the outlines of the future relationship, which has already been given the political seal of approval in London and the EU capitals, will set the parameters of the talks as the two negotiating teams seek to replace the terms of the UK’s 45-year membership with new arrangements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youAccording to the head of infection medicine at the University of Edinburgh, four people in Scotland are being tested for coronavirus after returning from Wuhan.Speaking to the ’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, Prof Jürgen Haas said: “The situation will be pretty similar in pretty much all UK cities with a large number of Chinese students.

At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. A key concern is the range of severity of symptoms – some people appear to suffer only mild illness while others are becoming severely ill. This makes it more difficult to establish the true numbers infected and the extent of transmission between people. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and will be anxious that the virus could become more potent than it so far appears.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal.

Here are some details of what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is saying about the second case of coronavirus identified in the United States.The patient returned to the US from Wuhan on 13 January 2020, and called a healthcare provider after experiencing symptoms a few days later. The patient was admitted to a hospital, where infection control measures were taken to reduce the risk of transmission to other iniduals. The patient remains hospitalised in an isolation room in stable condition and is doing well.Based on the patient’s travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected 2019-nCoV. A clinical specimen was collected and sent to CDC, where laboratory testing confirmed the infection. The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) are investigating locations where this patient went after returning to Illinois and are identifying any close contacts who were possibly exposed. The patient has limited close contacts, all of whom are currently well and who will be monitored for symptoms. Since returning from China, the patient has had very limited movement outside the home.The CDC added that while it considered coronavirus “a serious public health threat” the immediate health risk to the US public was considered low.The BMJ (British Medical Journal) has an article about the psychological effects of quarantining a city, in response to the lockdown affecting more than 20 million people in China. While history reminds us that outright panic is unlikely, fear seems more certain as a consequence of mass quarantine. Anxiety within Wuhan is to be expected even without quarantine. During disease outbreaks, community anxiety can rise following the first death, increased media reporting and an escalating number of new cases. Mass quarantine is likely to raise that substantially, for multiple reasons.It says elevated anxiety may lead to a surge in patients referred to as the “worried well” and that stigma may affect those on the inside of the cordon. Previous incidents have seen residents of affected areas socially shunned, discriminated against in the workplace and their property attacked. Unless active steps are taken to prevent this, the official imposition of a cordon may aggravate such effects. Vigilante-imposed isolation can follow or even run ahead of official quarantine.A crucial question for how the outbreak will unfold is how contagious the virus is. Scientists around the world are trying to establish how many people, on average, each infected person will pass the virus on to, a number known as R0 in epidemiology. If this number is more than one, an epidemic will grow and if less than one it will fizzle out. An analysis posted online on Friday by scientists from Lancaster University puts R0 for the new coronavirus at 3.8 and estimates that should the epidemic continue unabated, there could be 191,529 infections by 4 February.Chinese state television’s traditional lunar new year extravaganza on Friday paid tribute to the people of Wuhan and to medical staff fighting the coronavirus crisis, urging them on to victory in the battle to defeat the outbreak, Reuters reports. Traditionally, hundreds of millions of people gather around their televisions to watch the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, a more-than-four-hour showcase of skits, music and dance that has been a TV staple since the first edition was broadcast in 1983.This year an extra segment was added at the last minute to what is normally a carefully planned show, slotted in early in the broadcast. The hosts offered their best wishes to medical staff on the frontlines and to the people of Wuhan. “We will definitely be victorious!” the hosts announced in unison.After a montage showing doctors and nurses in their hospitals donning protective gear and hard at work looking after their patients, the hosts read out further exhortations.Bai Yansong, one of state television’s best-known anchors, told the gala the virus segment had been prepared very shortly before the actual show. “Remember that we love you, not just today but every day in the future,” Bai said as the camera cut to an audience member with tears streaming down her face.Bai’s colleague Kang Hui, who often reads the main evening news, said the whole nation was involved in the virus fight. “There is no predicament we cannot get over,” Kang said, to stirring music against a backdrop of more scenes of medical workers in protective body suits.Here is the full statement by the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, in which he said the risk to the UK public remained low:COBR (Cobra) met today to discuss the situation in Wuhan, China, and elsewhere in Asia. I updated on the current situation, the preparedness of the NHS, and possible next steps.I am working closely with the other UK chief medical officers. We all agree that the risk to the UK public remains low, but there may well be cases in the UK at some stage. We have tried and tested measures in place to respond. The UK is well prepared for these types of incidents, with excellent readiness against infectious diseases.We have global experts monitoring the situation around the clock and have a strong track record of managing new forms of infectious disease. The UK has access to some of the best infectious disease and public health experts in the world.There are no confirmed cases in the UK to date. We have been carefully monitoring the situation in Wuhan, China, since the beginning of the outbreak and are now implementing our planned response.A public health hub will be set up in Heathrow from today. This consists of clinicians and other public health officials, in addition to existing port health measures. The World Health Organization has rightly responded quickly and China has introduced strong public health measures.This interactive shows where there are confirmed cases of the coronavirus:And this shows the extent of the transport shutdown in China:The person who tested positive in the US, the second person there to do so, is a woman in her 60s. She returned from Wuhan, China, on 13 January.In the UK, tests for coronavirus on 14 people in the UK have come back negative but there are checks ongoing on other people, the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has said.He was speaking after a meeting of the government’s Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall, chaired by the health secretary, Matt Hancock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b8ddbea84a0fc7866ca0216c19ee80b2cc6622/0_138_2120_1273/master/2120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49cbc28cf6cc78ea7bae89cc9dcb358","title":"social workers tell us how you feel about your job","story":"Take part in our survey to have your say about the profession and the wider sectorWhat’s it like to be a social worker in the UK right now?We have launched the latest edition of the  Jobs Social Lives survey into the issues affecting staff at all stages of their careers – from the frontline to management.The research, carried out by Ipsos Mori on behalf of the  and new regulator Social Work England, is an opportunity to have your say about issues including workloads, pay and how the profession is viewed.Our last Social Lives study, published in 2017, found more than four-fifths of participants were proud of what they do, and more than three-quarters said they enjoyed their jobs, but most thought their caseloads were too high.Help us to find out whether the picture has changed.

It is a fruity area.”Stokes was caught by Rassie van der Dussen, off the bowling of Anrich Nortje, leaving England 157-4. England advanced to 192 without further loss before bad light stopped play.After the close of play, Stokes was subsequently pictured signing autographs by the same tunnel where the incident took place.He was named the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in December 2019 after a summer of batting efforts during both the World Cup and the Ashes. Coincidentally, Sheeran, who the BBC described as Stokes’ biggest fan in its promotional tweet, announced the cricketer’s Spoty nomination.Stokes could expect to face a charge of using an “audible obscenity during an international match” which is a level one offence although it is understood that the International Cricket Council are unlikely to comment on the issue until late on Friday or possibly not until Saturday.Atherton’s colleague Nasser Hussain, also a former England captain, told Sky: “We can be cool and calm in the commentary box, but when you’ve just got out and someone is abusing you, you can lose the plot,” he said. “Everyone wants a piece of Ben Stokes, fans go up to him in hotels and airports, everyone wants a piece. Then you see the bad side, a South Africa fan will have a go, it’s part of the game and you have to suck it up.“It’s easy for us to say, he probably regrets it now, he’s going to have to bite his tongue.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daccc5161929275c6853652cb195a92f192e7bf1/0_214_7788_4673/master/7788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59464d70a24029e9cb793258ccd903b4","title":"hard challenging sport inside the world of competitive cheerleading","story":"A new Netflix series comes amid an explosion of interest in the activity in the UKLizzie Williams describes watching Netflix’s new cheerleading documentary, Cheer, as surreal. It was the first time the 26-year-old British cheerleader had seen an accurate portrayal of her sport – its mechanically precise choreography, the gravity-defying tumbling, and the sheer grit required to push past exhaustion.The six-part documentary, which aired in January, follows cheerleading champions from Navarro College in Texas as they defended their national title. It has been warmly welcomed by elite cheerleaders and coaches in the UK for putting their sport centre stage – and pushing past the idea that it’s all big grins and miniskirts.“Most people see the sideline cheer they see the pom-poms and dance side of it. They don’t understand all-star cheerleading exists and that it is a hard and challenging sport to compete in,” Williams, said while practising with the Unity Allstars Black team in south London. The group, which competes on the same level as Navarro, was placed seventh in the world last year.The series premiered as interest in cheerleading has exploded in the UK. Tori Rubin, the co-manager of the England cheerleading team and co-owner of Unity Allstar, said she started the company in 2006 with one team, but the gym now boasts 23 teams. The trend is echoed across the country, with an estimated 89,000 athletes competing at regional and national level.“It’s a great sport because it’s teamwork, it’s all about athletes working together in unison to create something spectacular. I used to be a gymnast and the thing I found really difficult was the inidual nature of the sport,” Rubin said. She praised the documentary for showing the athleticism required to be a competitive cheerleader. “It’s very similar to our practices. It’s indicative of what cheerleading is about it’s tough, it’s hard, but once you’re in it you’re obsessed.”While Unity AllStar Black is the only UK team that can compete at the same level as Navarro, the sport has developed rapidly across the country. “When I first got involved with the sport 15 years ago it was, in essence, mums with kids learning things from YouTube and books and competing with other mums with kids and pushing mats together,” said Joanna Gamper Cuthbert, the chair of SportCheer England, the national governing body for cheerleading in England. She added that teams have been able to dramatically increase their skill level because of the better training and education.Amanda Fairhall, the events director of Future Cheer, one of the country’s largest cheer competition organisers, said while US teams dominate the sport, “the gulf between us and the Americans has started to close”. She added: “The teams we send to compete in world championships are competing with the best of the best and holding their own.”Navarro’s long road to becoming national champions is littered with broken bones, blood and tears. Williams does not shy away from the risk that comes with being a competitive cheerleader, but said: “If you trust your bases that takes away a lot of the fear factor. If they trust you to do your job and you trust them to do their job, then you’ve got the confidence to go for the skill that is scary to begin with.”The documentary has also received critical acclaim for its representation of male cheerleaders. Tyla Cousins, 21, who has been a cheerleader for nine years, said: “It’s still at that stage where I have to explain to my dad’s friends that it doesn’t include pom-poms. So for the people that don’t actually understand the sport, the documentary allows people to get to have a little view of what you do.”Cousins, who has previously broken his ankle in four places and cracked a rib, added it was not difficult to get people to understand the stamina required to take part.As awareness of the sport grows, children are being drawn in at a younger age. Reanne Snagg drives eight-year old Mya Benjamin-Clarke more than an hour to Unity Allstar’s gym to train. Mya goes four times a week for gymnastics, acrobatics, tumbling, and flying lessons. While Snagg loves seeing Mya become a more confident child, she admits it can be nerve-racking to watch as a parent. “When they’re flying, they do go very high and as a mother you can’t help but think, ‘Oh my God please catch my child!’”To sustain the interest of the growing number of girls and boys who want to take part in the sport, the cheer community needs money. “Sport England recognition would mean our grassroots community programmes would have access to funding that’s ringfenced for sport,” Gamper Cuthbert explained. The funding would also support the pioneering work already done in the inclusion of disabled athletes in cheerleading.SportCheer England, which operates on “glitter and a prayer”, is determined to not only get recognition from Sport England, but to see the sport on the Olympic stage.It’s a dream that many hope to see realised at Unity AllStars. But, for now, the athletes remain focused on completing their routine without a single mistake. It’s brutal and exhausting work that takes its toll. As the Black team gets ready to go again, they cheer each other on as Rubin shouts: “If you think you are tired, remember you’re not tired.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77bd27cc767dcff191d6381ba81d79a0fb19ff39/1676_46_1614_968/master/1614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8181d41005caeb23ec5a7ec1cb7fbb8","title":"saracens ceo ed griffiths","story":"Ollie Thorley is confident that the fallout from the Saracens scandal will not affect England’s Six Nations campaign after the squad quickly addressed the issue following their arrival in Portugal for a week-long training camp.“We had a casual get-together when we first met and got together today for the first time as a group when we had conversations,” said the uncapped Gloucester wing. “The Saracens thing was touched on a little bit: the players said they were here to play for England and everyone respected that.“When they are here they are England players and that is all that matters. They are exceptionally professional people, some of the best rugby players in the world, and there is no difference in their attitude from the other times I have been with the England squad.”Thorley said that the first act of the England head coach, Eddie Jones, in Portugal had been to mention the World Cup and warn players of the lessons of history, which showed that the runners-up in the tournament tended to dip in the following year and make little impact in the next World Cup.“Eddie knows we cannot rest on our laurels,” said the 23-year old. “We are having a meeting about the World Cup to make sure we push on from it. It is a new start, enhancing the good things, and having been in the environment before I know more what to expect. Being uncapped, I do not just want to play for England but play well.”Thorley admires the 19th century British prime minster Benjamin Disraeli and quotes Matthew Syed’s book Rebel Ideas, which he cites when asked about the impact he feels the new backs coach Simon Amor will have on the squad and the way England attack.“It is important to have interests beyond the pitch,” he said. “I had a wonderful history teacher at school and became interested in the Victorian era. Disraeli was a quirky character, a bit of a maverick and an underdog who in a rigid society rose to the top.“Simon addressed the squad today after six years with the Sevens. He has a different way of thinking and Rebel Ideas looks at the principle of having someone from a different perspective coming into an environment that is performing well but you want to get a bit more out of. We are excited to see what he will change. He is a very intellectual man and it is a great opportunity for us.”Back in England, Saracens’ new chief executive, Ed Griffiths, has denied working as a cricket agent, following claims he has been reported to the England and Wales Cricket Board.Griffiths has rejected any wrongdoing after reports in a national newspaper that the ECB is investigating a possible conflict of interest over his consultancy role with Middlesex.The former South Africa Rugby Union adviser has rejoined Saracens to help steer the Premiership club through the salary cap scandal that resulted in them accepting relegation at the end of this season.“I am not an agent, I have never acted as an agent and I have never received a commission to work as an agent,” Griffiths told the PA news agency.Griffiths insisted there has been no conflict of interest in his dealings with Middlesex, adding: “I have never received a commission or a payment from a player at all. I have contacted the ECB and spoken to the head of integrity about this.”Premiership Rugby’s handling of the Saracens salary cap scandal could be the subject of a parliamentary inquiry. The Conservative MP Damian Collins, who is standing for re-election as chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, has criticised Premiership chiefs for allowing the crisis to unfold and says it is “right to challenge” how they handled it.“The situation at Saracens has clearly been a problem for a long time,” he said. “Things should never have been allowed to develop in the way they did and it’s right for people to challenge the Premiership as to why it didn’t take more effective action sooner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36fda44bf76121e14ff6905195f0bde643d35dcd/0_21_3056_1833/master/3056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=460c5f81944f9dbf23413b4f3cb86e74","title":"south africa england fourth test day one report","story":"The Bullring did not disappoint, despite the loss of the morning session to rain and an early exit for bad light. The ball whizzed through at pace most batsmen felt the urge to respond aggressively. It paid to keep a close eye on proceedings. This venue may not be beautiful but it is a modern Colosseum of cricket, which requires bravery as well as skill among the combatants.After 54.2 overs of play England, having chosen to bat, despite all that early-morning moisture, were 192 for four. They may be satisfied by that, even though the openers posted a century partnership, but they must also be aware that the game can change rapidly here the nicks carry, the adrenalin flows and the pendulum swings.Like the old Waca ground at Perth it is a place where any cricketer worth his salt wants to play, which may explain the obvious disappointment of Jofra Archer when he had to acknowledge that a recurrence of pain in his right elbow when bowling before the start precluded him from returning to the team. So the only change to the England side was that Chris Woakes replaced Dom Bess. Everyone loves the Bullring except the finger-spinner.Faf du Plessis lost his seventh toss in a row and the old firm of Zak Crawley and Dominic Sibley soon set to work diligently. In fact Du Plessis might have welcomed losing this toss. He said that he would have gambled on bowling, which goes against the grain here. After a wicketless session such a decision might have added to his cricketing woes, which appear to be mounting by the day.Crawley was fluent from the start, cover driving with remarkable grace for such a tall man. Soon Du Plessis began to shuffle his bowlers with increasing desperation. Like England he had dispensed with his specialist spinner so there was limited variety available though the new cap, Beuran Hendricks, a mere 29, does propel the ball with his left arm. He tried his fastest bowler, Anrich Nortje, but twelve runs came from his first over. Full-pitched deliveries declined to swing, and Crawley in particular kept disposing of them.Sibley had more alarms. On 10 he was given out caught down the leg-side off Hendricks by umpire Joel Wilson he reviewed immediately and successfully. On 12 he was caught in the gully off Philander but on this occasion Wilson had been on the ball – by calling a no-ball. Otherwise there were few alarms. Philander was blander than usual and the recalled Dwaine Pretorius was blander than that. Before long Crawley had posted a career-best score in his fifth Test innings in succession the last Englishman to do that was Ian Peebles in 1928.Nortje, though expensive at the start, worked up a head of steam in his second spell and one of his shorter deliveries hit Crawley on the helmet with the ball ricocheting out to cover. There was a long delay to check on Crawley’s wellbeing and to find him another helmet, which, when it finally arrived, did not fit him very well. On the stroke of tea the hundred was posted, ending the longest sequence, 69 innings, without one for England’s first pair. The last century partnership by England opening batsmen was in Chennai in 2016 when Alastair Cook and Keaton Jennings were together.So England were sitting pretty on a surface with sufficient pace to invite strokeplayers to display their wares the bounce was generous but true. But after tea, while the runs kept coming at a good lick, the wickets started falling as well. Sibley was genuinely caught down the leg side for 44 to give Hendricks his first Test wicket then Crawley, in two or possibly three minds (whether to pull, defend or leave) was caught at slip off Philander.Joe Denly naturally reached double figures – for the 22nd time in 25 innings – but his was an unusual innings by the standards he has set on this tour. He was positively skittish. A couple of glorious cover drives were interspersed with edges, inside and outside, that sped to the boundary and on 22 a hard chance was dropped by Pieter Malan at cover point off Paterson. Then Denly propped forward in defence to Paterson and this time the edge found the gloves of De Kock.Now came the wicket that the South Africans really celebrated with glee. It has been noticeable how often Du Plessis has referenced the excellence of Ben Stokes in this series, as an example for his players to follow: this pair were colleagues in the IPL back in 2017 and there is clearly mutual respect in abundance. His wicket is treasured perhaps as much as Root’s so when Stokes miscued with an unusually ugly drive – he seemed to be aiming somewhere on the leg-side – and the ball flew into the increasingly reliable hands of Rassie van der Dussen at slip, the South Africans were cock-a-hoop. Stokes, however, wasn’t and a few choice words to a spectator as he departed may have lasting ramifications for the ICC cricketer of the year.Batting was far more taxing now and Root and Ollie Pope, both busily seizing any run-scoring chances, batted well as the light faded. They were tested along the way there was an involuntary four over the slip cordon from Root as he sought to avoid a Nortje bouncer Pope ended up on the floor as he took late, evasive action from a Hendricks bouncer. And they say the pitch quickens up on the second day.

Firstly, what on earth did this ‘fan’ say to Stokes, if anything. Was it abusive? If it was, then one could have sympathy. I don’t personally agree with the idea that professional sportsman are fair game to be personally abused by ‘paying spectators’. The Stokes story is being covered from the Wanderers by my colleague Chris Stocks.Play, by the way, has been called off. The day ends with honours just about even, but South Africa, I suspect, the happier of the two camps, and eyeing a win that would save face as well as the series. Ollie Pope is in such good form that he could take it away from them tomorrow, as he did at the same stage of the last Test, and a fellow called Root could get a few too. But England are always breakable, as they’ve shown yet again this evening, and the pitch is offering bounce and movement to bowlers who can summon some intensity. Ben Stokes will probably take a five-for. Thanks for your company, your trenchant views and your fine turn of phrase.Time for some light relief. “Just to clarify,” says Rory Dollard on Twitter, “some of Ben Stokes’ best friends wear glasses. Ask Jack Leach.”A tough line on Stokes from one of our regulars. “I appreciate this is probably a minority view,” says Geoff Wignall, “but I’m hoping fervently that Stokes is in line for a lengthy ban. As a fully fledged member of the Ben Stokes Not a Fan Club, I don’t much care how talented he is or how hard he works at his game. Street brawls and an absence of sportsmanship (as per the WC final) are bad enough but for me he should never have been near the England team after his social media abuse of a vulnerable, disabled teenager. His essential loutishness had been too well demonstrated over an extended period.” Loutish, at times, yes. And no excuse for abuse of anyone. But was he unsporting in the World Cup final? I thought he tried not to take that four-run freebie. And I’m not sure it’s fair to discount his talent or his drive. They’re part of the package and with Stokes, even more than the average sportsman, you see a blur between his strengths and his weaknesses. The fire in the belly is apt to flare up into a blaze of fury.Ben Stokes is trending on Twitter. “Stokes should know that language like that is bad,” says Cosmos. “These days you simply cannot mock the myopic.”Ah, shame. They’re off for the light, which doesn’t seem all that bad, but then it’s hard to tell on the telly. That may well be that for the day. If so, it’s been a day of two sessions, and two halves: the afternoon belonged to England, the evening to South Africa. For the first time in a decade, England started their first innings with a hundred partnership for the umpteenth time in any period you choose to mention, they collapsed. And Ben Stokes, so often the hero in the past year, may have become the villain after using some seriously bad language to a spectator.54th over: England 192-4 (Root 25, Pope 22) Pope cracks Philander square, and only gets a single for it. He’s been so positive, riding the wave of his good form.Here’s more on that moment with Stokes, from the eagle-eared Mike Lyle, who heard Stokes “arguing with a fan” as he left the field. “He had barely stepped over the boundary rope when he said, ‘Come and say that that to me outside the ground, you fucking four-eyed cunt!’” Wow. If that is confirmed, it’s bad.“That guy really has some serious anger issues, no doubt he will get away with it without punishment but if that happened at my local club he would be facing an immediate ban.”53rd over: England 191-4 (Root 25, Pope 21) Root plays a cover push for a single which wouldn’t be worth describing if it were not the 500,000th run for England in Tests, a first for any country. It’s only taken them 143 years. Things get more interesting later in the over as Hendricks bowls a gem of a bouncer to Pope, jagging in and following him as he tries to sway out of the way. He ends up on his back, but smiling.52nd over: England 185-4 (Root 24, Pope 16) A single to each batsman off Philander, which may sound comfortable enough – except that Root’s comes off an inside edge into his groin. It’s been a bad day for the most sensitive part of a man’s anatomy. 51st over: England 183-4 (Root 23, Pope 15) A few more singles. The commentators are chuntering because there are inviting gaps in the infield – the South African strategy feels like neither one thing nor the other, neither attacking nor defending. Still, it’s worked a treat since tea.“Re: Hubert O’Hearn’s query (over 47),” says Jon Taylor, “all Test sides are prone to batting collapses, the difference is the terminology. When England collapse, we refer to it as ‘an embarrassing capitulation’. When our opponents collapse, we call it ‘an unplayable spell from Stuart Broad’.” Ha.50th over: England 180-4 (Root 22, Pope 13) Philander returns, to be treated with due respect by Pope, who picks up a single with a cut.“I just switched onto the Sky coverage,” says Thomas Atkins. “Did I just see them accidentally playing and rewinding Stokes going up the tunnel and someone saying a very, very bad word indeed?” I suspect you did. I was a bit busy cursing myself as we’ve been having some technical troubles too.49th over: England 179-4 (Root 22, Pope 12) Root picks up a one and a two off Paterson. There are still, in theory, 16 overs to go tonight, which means we may well be going through to 6.30pm, or 4.30 in the UK.“Oh Kim!” says Brian Withington (38th and 44th overs). “... Make that a howl of impending existential despair!”48th over: England 175-4 (Root 19, Pope 11) Pope shows his class with a dreamy straight drive for four off Nortje, followed by a merely commanding cover drive for two. If you didn’t know, you might think it was Pope, not Root, who had just reached 7500 runs in Tests.47th over: England 167-4 (Root 18, Pope 5) Root plays a front-foot pull, which might alarm Silverwood, but shows confidence in himself and the pitch, and gets him four.“Only been following cricket about a year,” says Hubert O’Hearn on Twitter, “so this is honest, not trolling. Are England collapses, um, normal among Test sides? It’s like some strange vibration goes through them and cool, pro athletes all spasm. Like football’s Phil Jones.” Ha, yes. And like the man who was once the next Duncan Edwards, they do quite a lot of things very well in between.46th over: England 161-4 (Root 13, Pope 4) Ollie Pope, England’s new star, begins with some nice crisp leaves and then cashes in with a tuck through midwicket. That at least makes sure that not every batsman has made fewer than the one before, but the stark fact remains that, from Sibley to Stokes, England lost four wickets for 50 in 12.3 overs.Stokes slashes at a full fast ball from Nortje, angled across him, and van der Dussen takes another cool calm catch. Ladies and gentlemen, out of nowhere, we have a good old England collapse.45th over: England 157-3 (Root 13, Stokes 2) Stokes, also watchful, blocks a few from Paterson before taking a single, which is his 1000th run against South Africa – a quarter of them in one innings.44th over: England 156-3 (Root 13, Stokes 1) Root, who’s been watchful, tries to get out of the way of a snorter from Nortje and ends up edging it for four. That was the opposite of playing-and-missing: leaving-and-hitting.“I see Kim Thonger’s faux pessimism,” says Brian Withington, “and raise him a nervous chuckle.”43rd over: England 152-3 (Root 9, Stokes 1) I wonder if Denly, seeing Crawley and Sibley do so well, decided that the blocker he’s been for the past year was suddenly no longer needed. He ended up playing the sort of top-three innings Trevor Bayliss believed in and Chris Silverwood doesn’t.Gone! Third time unlucky for Denly as he fences at a good ball from Paterson and gives a straightforward catch to first slip. He finishes with a very typical Denly score, made in a very untypical way.42nd over: England 149-2 (Denly 27, Root 7) Another stroke of luck for Denly, who goes back to Nortje when he should be forward and gets away with a squirt through the vacant third slip. He then pulls, expansively, and is dropped again – this time at midwicket, a hard chance that leaves Dwaine Pretorius nursing a sore finger.41st over: England 142-2 (Denly 21, Root 6) Denly clearly has a plane to catch. He cover-drives Paterson for four, glides for two, then inside-edges for four more. His strike rate today is 72 per hundred balls, as against 39 in the rest of his Test career.40th over: England 131-2 (Denly 10, Root 6) Undeterred, Denly cracks Philander for four off the back foot, then takes a single to slip into double figures, as he has done every time he’s batted in this series. Michael Holding has some advice for the bowlers: “Get him coming forward – he’s a lot more uncertain.”39th over: England 125-2 (Denly 5, Root 5) That said, it’s good to see Denly going for his shots. He’s going to keep getting out for 30 if he just comes to the party as a stone wall.Denly, facing Paterson, goes for another ambitious square drive, off the front foot this time, and Malan at point makes a great attempt to cling on, ing to his right.38th over: England 122-2 (Denly 4, Root 3) Better from Denly, who waits for the top of the bounce, off Philander, and plays a handsome back-foot drive for three.“Would you regard me as overconfident,” asks Kim Thonger, “if I say I think that England have a decent chance of getting to 200 before they are all out?” The experts at Sporting Index have England down for something in the 380s. They could do with a Thonger.37th over: England 118-2 (Denly 1, Root 2) Denly, who always looks such a natural strokeplayer, has somehow found a way of becoming a barnacle. He blocks and blocks as Hendricks probes, and would be gone if du Plessis had posted a short leg. 36th over: England 117-2 (Denly 1, Root 1) So the young openers finally show their inexperience by getting out, to ordinary deliveries, in quick succession. One more wicket and South Africa will be right back in this. Not that Faf seems to realise it: he greets Joe Root with a cover sweeper, when he should surely have a second gully.Just when he was looking so good, Crawley goes and blows it with a pointless waft at the first ball of a new spell by Philander, and gives a simple catch to first slip. That cluster of wickets may be under way.35th over: England 116-1 (Crawley 66, Denly 1) Hendricks decides that the short ball which did for Sibley is worth another go, and Crawley pulls it, off the front foot, for four. Coming after all those mistimed pulls, that may well be the shot of the day.34th over: England 110-1 (Crawley 61, Denly 1) Denly gets off the mark with a nudge to leg off Paterson, while Crawley keeps cruising along with a couple of singles. And Philander, shying at the stumps, manages to hit Paterson in the small of the back, which rather sums up South Africa’s day so far. To my untrained eye, this pitch is like a quicker version of Headingley – there’s plenty in it for everyone, and you could well see wickets falling in clusters.33rd over: England 107-1 (Crawley 59, Denly 0) Joe Denly starts as he means to go on, with a couple of leaves. Can he see his Kent team-mate to a first Test hundred?The breakthrough! Hendricks digs it in, from round the wicket, and Sibley, fencing, can only nick it down the legside. That’s Hendricks’ first test wicket, and a rather bathetic end to a fine opening stand. 32nd over: England 106-0 (Crawley 58, Sibley 44) Faf du Plessis goes back to Dane Paterson, who was the best of the bowlers this morning, not that it’s saying much. He starts tidily before handing Sibley a gimme, too short and wide of off. “When you’ve got Sibley scoring behind square,” says Shaun Pollock, “you know you’ve missed your areas.”31st over: England 102-0 (Crawley 58, Sibley 40) Beuran Hendricks reopens the proceedings and immediately beats Crawley, who flashes at a back-of-a-length ball outside off. Faced with a similar delivery later in the over, he pulls for a single, showing again that he’s not the type to be once beaten, twice shy.A good question from Eddy Richards, to go with a cup of tea. “Have England gone from zero openers to three in the space of a couple of months? In the interests of irony, no doubt we’ll suddenly lose all our all-rounders!”30th over: England 100-0 (Crawley 57, Sibley 39) Crawley takes a single off Nortje, and Sibley clips for four through square leg to bring up the hundred partnership. That’s lunch – a suitable way to round off a dream of a session for England, and their first opening stand of a hundred in 70 Test innings, since Cook and Jennings found a decent response to India scoring 750 just over three long years ago. It’s been a case of Sibley, Crawley, quickly but surely. See you shortly.29th over: England 95-0 (Crawley 56, Sibley 35) As if a blow to the groin wasn’t bad enough, Sibley is in some discomfort against Hendricks. The left-arm-over angle has him falling over to the off side, which leads to an LBW shout (not out, pitching outside leg) and then a near-yorking as Sibley trips himself up. With feet like that, he could get a game for Manchester United.28th over: England 89-0 (Crawley 56, Sibley 29) After several minutes, Crawley takes a new helmet from Jonny Bairstow and re-enters the fray. I do hope he’s all right. Nortje greets him with another bouncer, in the great tradition of the nasty fasty, but it’s so high that it’s called a wide.Meanwhile Ian Forth has a thought about England’s sudden surplus of top-order batsmen. “Though Denly has been admirable in the last year, I wonder if he is the most likely to give way, given age and limitations, leaving a Sibley, Burns, Crawley top 3 for the next few years. Of course, it could easily be Jennings, Hameed, Duckett in a year’s time - what do I know?”Mid-28th over: England 88-0 (Crawley 56, Sibley 29) At last, a well-aimed bouncer from SA, bowled by the pacey Nortje. It’s rather too well-aimed for Crawley, who plays a hook, misses, and takes a blow flush on the helmet, above his eyes. He’s still standing, and seems OK, but there’s a delay for the usual concussion tests. “You seem to be forgetting,” says Paul Haynes, “that most of us have no access to viewing the cricket, which is why we follow it via your live reporting. Exciting cricket is terrible, as we non-viewers are missing out on the action, but if it’s a bit boring, then the investment of refreshing or checking every 10 minutes gets a fair return. A boring century is thus better for the OBO enthusiast who doesn’t need to watch it. Personally, apart from the 2019 World Cup final, I haven’t seen a game of cricket since 2005!” That is quite a record.27th over: England 88-0 (Crawley 56, Sibley 29) Beuran Hendricks returns after making a decent start to his Test career with the new ball. But he too comes bearing gifts – a half-volley which Crawley punches back past him with great confidence, and a short one which Crawley can’t quite time or place. If he had played the pull as crisply as the drive, he’d be on 80 by now. 26th over: England 83-0 (Crawley 51, Sibley 29) A couple of singles off Nortje, whose over ends with Sibley taking a nip-backer in the groin. He winces, and the whole world winces with him.25th over: England 81-0 (Crawley 50, Sibley 28) Sibley celebrates his mate’s landmark with an on-drive for four as Pretorius gets too floaty again. One of the hopeful signs for this new-look England is the pleasure they take in each other’s achievements. Sibley and Crawley will soon be competing for one slot as Burns’s opening partner, but they’re not letting that get in the way of the team’s interests.Zak Crawley goes to his first Test fifty with a single to backward point off Pretorius. It was a leading edge, so perhaps his worst shot of the day. More importantly, he has nine fours and “has got his tempo spot-on,” as Nasser says. And he won’t be 22 till next week.24th over: England 75-0 (Crawley 49, Sibley 23) Nortje goes wide on the crease and beats Sibley, poking uncertainly at a lifter. When you see Sibley play outside off stump, you wonder how on earth he managed to score a Test century.23rd over: England 74-0 (Crawley 49, Sibley 23) And... ACTION! Pretorius, who has at least been frugal so far, suddenly hands out some freebies. Crawley thumps one half-volley through the covers, another past midwicket, and a third back past the bowler. The second one took Crawley to 45, his highest Test score. He just keeps going up, so no wonder he likes it at altitude. “Over 18, Dane and Dwaine bowling together...” says Dan Silk. “Please say they’re bowling dibbly-dobblies? At the very least we need Dwaine’s Dibbly.”22nd over: England 62-0 (Crawley 37, Sibley 23) Back comes Anrich Nortje, after a bad start and a stint on the Nortje step. He does better, stringing a few dots together and then squeezing a semi-false stroke out of Sibley, who fends awkwardly close to gully and gets a streaky four.“I’m sure,” says Alan Shillitoe, “there’s a Red Dwarf joke to be had from Dwaine-Sibley somewhere, but I can’t quite find it!”21st over: England 57-0 (Crawley 36, Sibley 19) An edge! As Paterson bowls Crawley something resembling a leg-cutter, and it doesn’t carry to slip. Both the ball, and the stroke, could have been flown in from Port Elizabeth. Crawley then takes another single with a pull, to round off the most exciting over I’ve covered today.20th over: England 56-0 (Crawley 35, Sibley 19) Another single for Crawley. That’s 19 off the last ten overs, following 37 off the first 10. We may have a new world record time for a Test match going to sleep.19th over: England 55-0 (Crawley 34, Sibley 19) Paterson gets away with a half-tracker to Crawley, who can only help it round the corner for a single. SA have managed to dry up the scoring, but what they really need is a wicket.18th over: England 54-0 (Crawley 33, Sibley 19) A change at the other end as Pretorius replaces Philander. It’s a maiden, to Sibley, but more interestingly we have a Dane and a Dwaine bowling together. And neither has a middle name.

Where’s the danger now? And will we ever get over the shock?Everything you know is a lie. Yesterday, the world was shaken to its very foundations when a video of Justin Bieber taking part in James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke revealed that the whole thing is a sham, and James Corden doesn’t actually drive the car – rather, it’s towed by a truck.Frankly, from this point onwards, up is down and down is up. Who knows what to believe any more? If Corden doesn’t really drive the car on Carpool Karaoke, then what else has he been lying to us about? Did he really write Gavin \u0026amp Stacey, or did he use a ghostwriter? Are the 1,000-year-old eggs he uses in Fill Your Guts or Spill Your Guts really 1,000 years old? Next he’ll be telling us that he isn’t even really a hideous dancing CGI cat. How dare he? The man, quite honestly, deserves to spend the rest of his days sitting on a throne of fibs at the summit of Porky Pie Mountain.And before you accuse me of overreacting, let me point out that I am by no means alone in my shock. Once the pictures hit the internet, all hell broke loose. “I feel lied to,” raged one presumably former Corden fan on Twitter. “Haven’t felt this betrayed since finding out Santa Claus isn’t real,” screamed another, angry enough to punch the head clean off the next cardboard Peter Rabbit cinema standee she saw. The world is on my side here. We’re hurt and angry.Oh, sure, there have been other fakery scandals in the past. In 2007, BBC One’s controller was forced to resign after a documentary edited footage of the Queen to make her look slightly more grumpy than she actually was. The BBC’s Frozen Planet wildlife series was partly filmed in a zoo. The X Factor used to film its contestants flying business class to Los Angeles, before shunting them off to economy once the cameras stopped rolling. But that’s fine. You expect lies from BBC One and David Attenborough. But James Corden? Impeccable torch of moral virtue James Corden? No. Never.There will be those who will try to defend this scandal, claiming that it is simply standard practise for the TV industry and that it probably wouldn’t have been that safe for him to be so distracted while driving, but it’s too little, too late. The joy of Carpool Karaoke was never the singing. The singing part is terrible. Nobody wants to watch a professional singer drowned out by Corden howling and shrieking like a burning witch. That’s awful. It’s offensive on every level.But now, what’s the point? All this time – with Adele, with Mariah Carey, with Paul McCartney, when he let Stevie Wonder have a go at driving – Corden has been snuggled up all tight behind a tow truck. It’s heartbreaking. Never at any point was Corden ever in danger of accidentally mowing through a crowd of tourists and wrapping his car around a lamppost. Still, at least we’ve finally worked out how he got car insurance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d569df7c28a1c6e9e91b30d1a092b9da2d3cea09/76_119_5454_3274/master/5454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2262e18571c63103c755e81e1a8d4da","title":"church of england urged to apologise for windrush racism","story":"Synod to debate motion proposing inquiry into whether church is institutionally racistThe Church of England should apologise for its “horrible and humiliating racism” towards people of the Windrush generation, many of whom were turned away from parish churches, and it should consider commissioning an independent report on institutional racism, a member of its clergy has said.The church’s ruling body, the General Synod, will debate a motion next month calling on it to “lament the conscious and unconscious racism experienced by countless black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) Anglicans in 1948 and subsequent years”.The motion also calls on the church to “stamp out all forms of conscious and unconscious racism” and to commit to increasing the representation of BAME Anglicans.The Rev Andrew Moughtin-Mumby, who is proposing the private member’s motion, said on Friday there was an urgent need for the church to “get our house in order”. He said he had become “more and more angry that we don’t hear from our church standing in solidarity with victims of racism”.Some of the Windrush generation found a warm welcome in parish churches, he said, but many others experienced appalling racism. A paper to be submitted to the synod includes an account from Doreen Browne, who arrived in the UK in 1956 aged 16. She described her mother being turned away on the steps of St Peter’s church in Walworth, south London, “due to the plain fact of the colour of her black skin”.Moughtin-Mumby said: “We know that many people did not find a home and simply left the C of E – a scandal for us.” He said Browne’s mother had experienced “horrible and humiliating racism from a priest who should have been welcoming her”.The church should apologise and should consider commissioning an independent person to investigate whether it was institutionally racist, he said.“In terms of the number of ordained clergy, the picture is good, but in senior leadership it’s not good, and that has an effect on the whole church,” he said. “We need to admit that the church is in some ways institutionally racist because we have not managed to create a space in which everyone can flourish.”However, the retirement of John Sentamu, the archbishop of York and the most senior BAME figure in the church, will leave just three minority ethnic bishops out of a total of about 120. All three are suffragan bishops, junior to diocesan bishops."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150194.1579878155!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"clamping on dublin city streets increased by 8 last year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOver 7,300 vehicles were clamped after their paid parking had expired by over the “grace period” of 10 minutes, while around 4,280 vehicles were detected parking on a clearway. File photograph: Alan BetsonThe Dublin’s Mespil Road is the city’s worst blackspot for the clamping of illegally parked vehicles.New figures on parking enforcement activity in the capital last year show 911 vehicles were clamped on Mespil Road.Figures published by Dublin City Council show the overall number of vehicles clamped in the city last year rose by almost 8 per cent with an average of 127 offending motorists getting caught each day.Mespil Road, which is located along the Grand Canal between the bridges at Baggot Street and Leeson Street, had consistently been the most likely location in Dublin city to be clamped for many years before being overtaken by the South Circular Road in 2018.However, a 19 per cent increase in the number of vehicles detected as being parked illegally on Mespil Road last year has seen it back again in top position as a clamping blackspot.More than half the vehicles clamped on Mespil Road are for the offence of parking in spaces reserved for buses and coaches.The South Circular Road had the second highest level of enforcement activity with 642 vehicles clamped followed by Waterloo Road where 549 were clamped.The main street in Ranelagh has emerged as a new location where vehicles are likely to be clamped if parked illegally – up from 87 in 2018 to 537 last year – the fourth highest total.Overall the number of vehicles clamped in Dublin city last year was up by over 3,400.The clamped vehicles would generate revenue of over €3.7m if all their owners paid the standard release fee of €80.Vehicles which are not removed within 24 hours are towed away and impounded leaving their owners having to pay a release fee of €160 plus a daily storage charge of €35 to have them returned.The the other city streets where most vehicles were clamped in 2019 were Burlington Road (470), Parnell Street (437), Merrion Square South (422), Ormond Quay Upper (415), Merrion Square West (369) and Townsend Street (365).Obstructing cycle tracksDublin City Council signed a new five-year contract for parking enforcement last September with a company controlling Dublin Street Parking Services which has been operating clamping services in the capital since 2004.The new contract is worth approximately €36.7m over the five years.A spokesperson for Dublin City Council said total income from parking in 2019 had not yet been calculated but the figure was €32m in 2018 consisting of €29m in parking fees and €3m from clamping.Although there are approximately 30,000 on-street parking spaces in the city, the council said the number of parking spaces fluctuated in the past two years due to suspensions, new schemes and construction projects.The most common reason why vehicles were clamped last year was due to the failure to have valid paid parking which accounted for approximately a third of all offences.Over 7,300 vehicles were clamped after their paid parking had expired by over the “grace period” of 10 minutes, while around 4,280 vehicles were detected parking on a clearway.A total of 465 motorists had their vehicles clamped for parking in a space reserved for disabled drivers without a valid permit, while 227 vehicles were detected obstructing cycle tracks.Dublin City Council figures show the most common time of the day to be clamped is between 11am and 12 midday.Thursday was the day of the week when the most vehicles were clamped, while the fewest number were clamped on a Sunday.Somewhat surprisingly, more vehicles were clamped on a Saturday than a Monday, despite fewer parking restrictions being in place in some parts of the city at weekends.Due to the extended holiday period, December was the month when the least number of vehicles were clamped – just 2,492. It was around half the level of enforcement activity in the busiest month – May – when 4,798 vehicles were clamped."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150281.1579882500!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"primary principals call for suspension of irish language requirement rule","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Irish Primary Principals Network’s annual conference in Dublin  heard that many schools are struggling to source substitute teachers to cover short-term absences. Photograph: Alan BetsonPrimary school principals have called for the Irish language qualification requirement for teachers to be suspended to ease the “crisis” in teacher supply.Under existing rules, all new primary teachers need to have a minimum of a H4 grade (60 to 69 per cent at higher level) in Irish in the Leaving Cert or an equivalent Irish diploma.The Irish Primary Principals Network’s (IPPN) annual conference in Dublin heard that many schools are struggling to source substitute teachers to cover short-term absences.“Recruiting surplus teachers from Northern Ireland is an attractive option, particularly for our border counties, as is recruiting teachers trained in other countries whose first language is English,” it said, in a statement.“While it is very difficult to gauge the numbers, it is likely that there is a significant number of foreign-trained teachers who are not currently teaching, as they cannot fulfil the Irish language qualification requirement.“While the substitute scarcity continues, these teachers should, on a temporary basis and provided they have conditional Teaching Council recognition, be allowed to teach in short-term mainstream positions.”The conference also heard of major concerns relating to special needs, including a new system for “frontloading” special needs assistant (SNA) posts from next September.Pilot projectThe IPPN called for a pilot project to be fully completed and for lessons learned taken into account before changes to SNA allocation are implemented in schools.“ We were dismayed to be notified, during a recent briefing on the new guidelines, of the intention to implement the new model in all schools this September, despite the fact that the feedback from the pilot has not yet been assessed,” it said.“We have yet to hear how appeals are to proceed where schools feel the allocation is insufficient, or where there is a significant intake of children.“The supports promised over two and a half years ago, when the previous model was introduced, are still not in place so, again, how can we have faith that it will be different this time?”The network also said school leaders need to know what formula is being used to frontload the SNA model.In addition, the conference heard that the new model “vastly increases” the burden of responsibility on principals, as the allocation of resources to inidual children will switch from a special education needs organiser to the principal.Total inclusion modelThere is also a “high level of anxiety” in a debate over a new total inclusion model, which would place all special needs pupils in mainstream schools .This could see the closure of special schools and would ensure all special needs pupils – regardless of their level of ability – would be taught in their local school.The National Council for Special Education is exploring this issue and is due to issue a recommendation on this to the Department of Education later this year.In a statement, the network said every child should be educated in the setting that is most appropriate to their needs.But it added: “ IPPN will not support any proposals for change until the current system is fit for purpose . . . We are extremely concerned that we are now two years on from the current model being introduced and it still hasn’t been fully resourced. How could we even contemplate any change until it has been?“The bottom line is that children must be protected, especially our most vulnerable children, and we cannot allow for any possibility that they could be short-changed by the system.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Mallon served as deputy to John Hume for two decadesParty says corruption and weak governance are at the centre of scandals in IrelandFormer OECD employee was a controversial  of his grandfather\u0026rsquos writingsTemporary move may ease teacher supply \u0026lsquocrisis\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash Irish Primary Principals NetworkJudge notes no lasting effects as offer linked to incident at Kettles Country House in Swords approvedCourt told businessman and wife owed \u0026euro1.128m in arrears on 2008 mortgageAn average of 127 motorists clamped each day with Mespil Road worst blackspotGroup call for State pension age to be restored to 65 years of ageKeane (59) to quit as BBC News Africa editor because of illnessCourt told men entitled to presumption of innocence and State cannot keep remanding in custodyCourt heard catalogue of physical, verbal abuse by woman who locked up children for protracted periodsVaradkar admits people have \u0026lsquofrustration\u0026rsquo over health and housingMr Justice Donald Binchy says nothing to preclude him from allowing Eamon Harrison\u0026rsquos surrenderNarconon Trust took the case after An Bord Plean\u0026aacutela said Co Meath site was nort exemptTwo died when trawler Alize sank off Hook Head on January 4thJury returns not guilty verdict on murder charge in trial of Mark Tims over death of Anthony TimsProposed service to include early drop-off and late collection times"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150173.1579877164!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bbc s fergal keane treated for post traumatic stress disorder","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFergal Keane has been with the BBC for more than 30 years and has reported from some ofthe worst conflict zones in the world most notably during the Rwanda genocide. Photograph: Rolf MarriottBBCPA WireBBC News Africa editor Fergal Keane is to step down from his role as he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Mr Keane (59), who has been with the BBC for more than 30 years, has reported from some of the worst conflict zones in the world most notably during the Rwanda genocide.His reporting from there won him both the Royal Television Society journalist of the year award and the Sony Radio Reporter award.In a statement sent to BBC staff by head of news gathering Jonathan Monro, he confirmed that Mr Keane, who was brought up in Dublin and Cork, has decided to “step back from role” as BBC News Africa editor.The reasons given are personal. Mr Munro went on to the state: “For several years, Fergal has been dealing privately with the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, stemming from several decades of work in conflict zones around the world.“He has been supported throughout this time by friends and colleagues in news as well as well receiving professional medical advice.“However, he now feels he needs to change his role in order to assist his recovery. It’s both brave and welcome that he is ready to be open about PTSD.”‘Atmosphere of terror’In an article in  responding to suggestions that the media had not properly covered the Rwandan genocide, Mr Keane responded: “ I arrived in late May 1994. It was still a traumatising place. A week before, the BBC’s Geoff Spink and Andy Kershaw were caught in an attack and hunted through the bush by members of the Interahamwe.“They were lucky to escape. It simply is not possible to convey the atmosphere of terror for those of us who tried to cover the genocide. For some of us, it has left an enduring mark, a sense that we failed, not so much as journalists, but as human beings, because we saw things we were powerless to stop.”Mr Munro said Keane will remain with the corporation on different platforms across news and current affairs.Mr Keane also comments regularly on Irish history. He made a five part series for the BBC on the subject in 2011. His book Wounds about his family history in the Irish revolution wont the Christopher Ewart-Biggs memorial prize in 2017.In recent weeks he waded into the debate over the now postponed Royal Irish ConstabularyDublin politan Police.Pointing that his great-grandfather Patrick Hassett had been an RIC man in Co Clare, Mr Keane wrote in The : “One of the great liberations of the post-Troubles era was to shift the consideration of Irish history away from battles between nationalist and revisionist. The silencing of the guns made it easier to acknowledge the complexity of the past.“The age of social media does the opposite. Slogans replace intelligent appraisal. We risk descending into the arid wilderness of name calling.“These are perilous times. Taking a step back to the spirit of conciliation that marked the end of the Troubles in the North seems impossible to imagine. But without that kind of flexibility the centenaries of the next few years threaten to drag us onto ever narrowing ground.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150370.1579886298!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"social democrats propose us style vetting process for senior officials","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDeputy Catherine Murphy, co-leader of the Social Democrats, said the Official Secrets Act as currently framed is at odds with the culture of whistleblowing. File photograph: Cyril Byrne An American-style Oireachtas committee vetting process for senior appointments to public bodies should be introduced, the Social Democrats have suggested. The party has proposed that ministerial discretion in making major appointments should be limited and the process should be more open and transparent as a result. In the United States senior appointments such as judges, heads of federal agencies and ambassadors have to be scrutinised at the committee stage in the Houses of Congress. The party has also proposed an independent anti-corruption unit to tackle white collar crime. A ban on meetings without minutes, reform to the Official Secrets Act and making government officials accountable for decisions made are all contained in the party’s document Honest Politics. It suggests “inadequate governance and accountability systems are at the heart of cost overruns involving massive amounts of public resources that could be spent elsewhere”. Co-leader Catherine Murphy said the issue of honesty in Irish public life comes up after scandals, but lessons are not learned. She said €500 million has been spent to date on various tribunals investigating aspects of Irish life. Ireland, she suggested, cannot afford not to set up an anti-corruption unit with real teeth. “One of our greatest assets is also one of our greatest weaknesses - which is our informality,” she said. She maintained the Official Secrets Act as currently framed is at odds with the culture of whistleblowing. “We need people to come forward in relation to wrongdoing or malpractice,” she said. She suggested that all meetings involving public money and public decisions should be minuted. “You can’t have accountability without transparency without keeping a record of how decisions are made.” The party is proposing that the Ministers and Secretaries Act be reformed to make senior civil servants accountable for their actions. The party has also proposed the establishment of an Irish Electoral Commission to be headed up by a chief electoral officer of Ireland. He or she would administer all elections in Ireland and referendums. Their remit would include voter registration boundary isions campaign oversight political financing voter education and political online advertising.Politicians would have to declare all significant liabilities as well as assets and salary top-ups for committee chairpersons and whips would be abolished.Ms Murphy said a more transparent expenses process for TDs and senators will be needed. The party has two TDs in the outgoing Dáil, Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy, and hope to add a third through Gary Gannon who is standing in Dublin Central.

He won’t do government with Fine Gael. The question really is does Micheál Martin do government. Will he next be saying he won’t go into government with Fianna Fáil?” She said had never seen such “a cantankerous approach” at a time when people desperately needed leadership and solutions.Ms McDonald, who was canvassing with Kerry candidate Pa Daly, said no sensible person would think it appropriate for someone who wanted to be taoiseach to spend his time running down and criticising another party and excluding the people who support Sinn Féin.Smear testsAnnouncing her party’s policy on the cancer screening programme CervicalCheck, Ms McDonald said smear tests should never have been sent abroad for analysis and that Sinn Féin in government would bring this responsibility back to Ireland over time. “It is vitally important that we have our own national screening laboratory service for CervicalCheck,” she said. “We will allocate €16 million to this, placing a focus on recruitment and training of specialist staff and equipping labs to the highest possible standard.”Ms McDonald said there had been “a huge human cost to the CervicalCheck scandal” and that “we owe it to the women affected” to change the system for the better. “The priority must be to ensure that women have the highest level of confidence in the screening process and we can achieve this through common-sense reforms.”TributeMs McDonald paid tribute to outgoing Kerry TD Martin Ferris, who is not seeking reelection, and his daughter, former councillor Toireasa Ferris. Ms Ferris ruled herself out of running to hold her father’s Dáil seat last summer and later announced she was giving up her seat on Kerry County Council. Local Sinn Féin activists say they are growing in confidence that Mr Daly will be able to retain the party’s seat in Kerry, which Fianna Fáil is hoping to gain having added Tralee councillor Norma Foley to its ticket.Mr Daly is well known locally due to his work as a solicitor and the fact Labour is not running a candidate in Kerry, a constituency where it held two seats a decade ago, is regarded as favourable to his cause.

Photograph: Jack Power Solidarity-People Before Profit has called for a general strike to “bring the country to a standstill” until increases to the pension age are reversed. The State pension age was increased to 66 in 2014, and a further planned increase to 67 next year has become a major issue of the general election campaign. Speaking on Friday, Solidarity-PBP TD Richard Boyd Barrett said the party was calling for the increase to be scrapped and the pension age returned to 65. The changes were brought in by the Fine Gael-Labour coalition government and meant in some cases when people were forced to retire at 65, they had to claim Jobseekers Allowance until they were eligible for the State pension. Under the legislation the pension age will increase again up to 68 on January 1st, 2028. Mr Boyd Barrett said his party had opposed the changes at the time and had consistently called for them to be reversed. “We have every reason when they’re talking about increasing the pension age to 68 to get people out on the streets, the same way we did with the water charges”, he said. Mr Boyd Barrett, who is seeking to retain his Dáil seat in the Dún Laoghaire constituency, said Solidarity-PBP were calling for a general strike on the issue. “We would like to see people bring this country to a standstill in order to prevent further increases in the pension age and to bring it back to where it should be at 65,” he said. Dublin Mid West TD Gino Kenny said a mass strike was “the only way you will put manners on this Government,” and was critical over the lack of industrial action from trade unions on the pension issue. “We have to ask why did the unions let it go this far in the first place, and we in the progressive left have been flagging this issue about the pension age for a long, long time,” he said. The party were launching its election policy on the cost of living, outside the central Revenue office on Cathedral Street, Dublin city centre. The policy called for the minimum wage to be increased to the living wage of €12.30 per hour for Universal Social Charge to be abolished for those earning less than €90,000 a year, and for workers to get four extra public holidays a year. Other policies included abolishing the Local Property Tax in favour of a wealth tax, and the introduction of a State owned not-for-profit insurance company to offer cheap premiums. Sandra Fay, who is standing in Dublin South-West, said Minister for Children Katherine Zappone had “absolutely” failed to tackle the high cost of childcare.

For some it was a moment to lament the Brexit process, while for others it was a time for celebration. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen (left) and  President of the European Council, Charles Michel sign the agreement in Brussels, Belgium.Photograph: European CommissionPA WireThe presidents of the European Council and the European Commission have formally signed the Brexit withdrawal agreement ahead of Britain’s departure from the EU next week.Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen put their signatures to the document in Brussels after the Queen gave royal assent to the legislation implementing the agreement on Thursday.The European Parliament is now expected to vote to approve the agreement on Wednesday, paving the way for the UK to leave on Friday next week, January 31st.It will mark the start of an 11-month transition period, during which the UK will continue to follow EU rules, before the final break with Brussels at the end of the year.British prime minister Boris Johnson has said that he wants to negotiate a comprehensive free trade deal with the EU by the end of the year.However, Ms von der Leyen and other senior EU figures have warned the British government’s stated intention to end the UK’s alignment with EU regulations means it will be impossible to achieve within such a tight timetable.Mr Johnson, however, remains upbeat, insisting Britain can now move forward after years of wrangling over Brexit.“At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we’ve done it,” he said.“Now we can put the rancour and ision of the past three years behind us and focus on delivering a bright, exciting future.”–PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Peter SummersGetty ImagesJust days ahead of Britain’s exit from the European Union, both sides claim to be well prepared for the forthcoming negotiations about their future relationship. Downing Street says Boris Johnson would happily start the talks the day after Brexit Day, if only the EU didn’t have to wait until February 24th to agree its negotiating mandate.Whitehall sources recall that the EU complained that Theresa May’s government was never clear about what it wanted, adding that Johnson’s approach would present no such problems. Britain wants a Canada-style free trade deal, they say, citing the Conservative manifesto’s promise that the future arrangement should involve no “political alignment”.The EU is unsure, however, what London means when it says it wants no alignment, and some in Brussels wonder if Downing Street itself knows.We will get an idea of the EU’s approach to the negotiations in the days after Brexit Day, when the European Commission publishes its “negotiation directives”. These will be the commission’s proposals for the negotiating mandate that must be approved by the 27 member-state governments.If Downing Street thinks the commission’s proposals represent an outlandish opening bid that will be substantially watered down by the member states, it is likely to be disappointed. Michel Barnier, who is leading the EU’s negotiating team, has been consulting the 27 governments to ensure that the commission’s proposals contain no surprises and the directives he publishes are likely to be close to the final negotiating mandate.Johnson will outline Britain’s approach in a speech in early February, which could also sketch out what he hopes to achieve in a trade deal with the US.Scaling downDespite warnings from Brussels about the tight timetable for the negotiations, both sides agree that it is possible to agree a deal by the end of this year, although the EU insists that such an agreement will have to be very limited. This could involve a dramatic scaling down of ambition a few months into the negotiations, prioritising progress in those areas where a cliff-edge at the end of the Brexit transition period at the end of December would be most damaging.Britain and the EU have a mutual interest in securing a free trade agreement covering goods and a security arrangement that allows them to continue to share information on criminal suspects and to extradite them with ease.The EU believes it is making Britain a generous offer of zero-tariff, zero-quota access for goods to its market of 450 million people. What it demands in return is a commitment from Britain to maintain a “level playing field” on state aid, social and environmental standards and taxation.Speaking in Davos on Thursday, chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid said Britain was leaving the single market and the customs union to gain control of its rules and laws.“We will be a sovereign and independent country, not a rule-taker. But we’ll always protect the interests of British businesses throughout this process and we’ll maintain high standards – not because we are told to, but because we want to,” he said.Voluntary arrangementJavid’s remarks reflect a view in Downing Street that Britain can voluntarily maintain high standards but it cannot agree to anything that would mean automatically adopting new rules set in Brussels. This rules out “dynamic alignment” with EU rules but it does not necessarily exclude a commitment to “non-regression” by maintaining at least the same high standards when the transition period ends in December.In May’s deal, which the EU regards as the starting point for negotiations, Britain agreed to dynamic alignment on state aid rules but only to non-regression on social and environmental standards. On taxation, Britain agreed to remain aligned with a number of directives.In reality, Britain spends much less on state aid than other big European countries, so a major expansion in its support for businesses would probably be possible even if it agreed to non-regression with the EU. EU member states watched with alarm Johnson’s swift intervention to rescue the airline Flybe and they will want any free trade agreement to include a cast-iron commitment on limiting state aid.Despite Johnson’s wish to de-dramatise the negotiations, they will inevitably hit turbulence, particularly on issues such as fish, which raise passions in a number of countries, including Britain. Any deal which is agreed within the few months available this year is certain to be a narrow one with major costs to Britain’s economy and to some member states. But neither side has yet adopted a position that makes a deal by December impossible.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

So far, 14 people tested for coronavirus in Britain have been given the all-clear but checks are still ongoing on ‘a handful’ of new cases, and an expert at Public Health England (PHE) said it was ‘highly likely’ the virus would reach the UK.Speaking after Cobra, which was chaired by the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Prof Witty, said: “We think there\u0027s a fair chance we may get some cases over time.“Of course this depends on whether this continues for a long time, or whether this turns out to be something which is brought under control relatively quickly.“I think we should definitely see this as a marathon, not a sprint we need to have our entire response based on that principle.”The Department of Health said most people who develop symptoms will get them after leaving the airport and so it was essential they knew what to do if they became ill. When asked why no physical tests were carried out on arrivals into the UK from Wuhan, before flights had stopped, Mr Whitty said: Every country does this slightly differently, that\u0027s always been the case.”He said that after a meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group of Experts, it was concluded: The screening would not really provide any appreciable increase in benefit for the UK public.How the coronavirus spreadsDr Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director for Public Health England (PHE) said: “There are no positive cases in the UK as yet, but we will go on testing and those numbers will of course change,” he told Radio 4’s Today programme. “I think it\u0027s highly likely that we will have cases in the UK, and of course every so often we do get new infections coming from the animal kingdom such as this one.”All the people tested in the UK are thought to have visited Wuhan and four out five patients tested in Scotland were from China, Downing Street said.Dr Cosford said anyone returning from China who experienced symptoms should avoid ‘pitching up’ at hospitals or their GP, and instead contact NHS 111.But he said that the majority of people would probably recover if they contracted the virus.The Chinese city of Wuhan is rapidly building a new 1,000-bed hospital to treat victims, while Disneyland Shanghai and parts of the Great Wall of China have been closed to visitors.Almost 30 million people and 10 cities in China are now facing travel restrictions and some hospitals are now reporting medical shortages.Private school groups are advising their members to consider planning for the possibility that pupils may not be able to travel during upcoming half term holidays in mid-February.A spokesperson for The Girls\u0027 Schools Association said “We are monitoring the situation carefully and are advising schools to consider planning for the eventuality that some pupils may not be able to travel home, or may choose not to travel home, for the half term or Easter holidays”.China sends more students to UK fee-paying schools than any other nation, data shows.The World Health Organization (WHO) is still refusing to declare an international public health emergency, which some experts said is ‘surprising.’In the past, the agency has been accused of overreacting to emerging pandemics, such as its response to bird flu in 2009.Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the University of Leeds, said:  The proportion of severe cases appears high. My hope is that this is not a decision that we might come to regret.Peter Piot, professor of global health and director at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the outbreak is in a ‘critical phase’ in which intensified international collaboration and more resources was crucial.Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Withdrawal Agreement Bill signed by European CommissionFrench unions promise months more strike action despite falling numbers as pension reform is finally unveiledSlimmers on 5:2 diet lose twice as much as weight as those trying \u0026#39Paleo\u0026#39Death of baby after emergency delivery was \u0026#39wholly avoidable\u0026#39  Michaela Strachan reveals she saves her dirty bathwater to flush the lavatory, as she urges others to change their behaviour to save the planetMadrid police bust €2m unlicensed Chihuahua-breeding pit in a cellar, rescuing 270 dogsEarl launches bid to save British beef cow which was favourite of the NormansHeated cushions for zero carbon churches as Bishop praises \u0026#39brilliant\u0026#39 Extinction Rebellion SNP Health Minister accused of \u0026#39trying to reshuffle herself out of a crisis\u0026#39 at Scotland\u0026#39s largest NHS board as special measures extendedComment: Militant activists have left us with a dangerously poor understanding of trans issuesNational service – should it be brought back?Chinese New Year 2020: Rats, luck and why you should avoid medicine, laundry and crying childrenWuhan woman \u0026#39cheated\u0026#39 coronavirus checks to fly out for Michelin-starred meal in FranceFriday evening news briefing: Cobra committee crisis talks on deadly virus outbreakFrance to protect crowing cockerels and smelly cows in law enshrining \u0026#39sounds and smells of the countryside\u0026#39Australia Day 2020: why the British sent convicts Down Under - and how they named the countrySalvini\u0026#39s hard-Right League on the brink of political earthquake in Left-leaning Italian heartlands Comment: The passing of the Brexit bill is a constitutional milestone.

My mission to make our house more sustainable starts with thinking about making it warmer this week, I’ve been mostly thinking about thermostats.Given my day job is technology editor here at The Independent, it’s the technological solutions that seem most immediate. And starting with the thermostat seems an obvious one, given how much money and emissions are wasted on central heating.We recently got a smart thermostat, after struggling with a decidedly un-smart timer on our boiler. There was of course nothing green about that, given that it spent much of the time coming on when we weren’t even in. And there was plenty that wasn’t comfortable about it, either, since it would often be on when the house was too hot, or not in as we shivered in the cold. (In the end we gave up and mostly turned it off and on manually.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe have the Nest Thermostat E. (Nest, which is now owned by Google, are probably the most famous of the smart home companies, and the thermostat is probably their most famous product the E supposedly stands for a variety of things including “easy” and “energy-saving”, but basically means that it’s the cheaper version.) It works by getting your location and learning how you tend to like your heating, setting up a smart schedule and turning the heating off when you’re not there.So since the beginning of the year I’ve been thinking about how best we can optimise the amount of energy that thermostat uses. Though it is smart, it still works on what you tell it as such, you can change what sort of temperature you want it to be.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

So the main thing I’ve done is turn the heating down before we get into bed, ensuring that we aren’t wasting heat that will only be around once we’ve gone to bed. (Another of my personal pledges for 2020 is to ensure that I pay full attention to my sleep, after reading Matthew Walker’s luminous book on the subject, and this helps with that too.)Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThe Nest gives you a leaf when you’re being energy-\u0026nbspand eco-conscious by having the temperature lower than it might expect. And I feel generally rewarded, too: while there’s no real way to know the impact this is having on our own gas usage, it feels like we almost certainly are saving energy.Smart thermostats – or, if you are like me and didn’t have a non-smart one before, any kind of thermostat – feel like a wonderful symbol of how easy it can be to be more efficient. As it turns out, we aren’t much colder our house is still heated when we need it. It’s just that it won’t be heated when we’re not there, or when we’re already warm enough. Saving money and emissions on heating has actually made life easier.Getting one is expensive, of course: the Nest Thermostat E is £199, and you’ll have to pay for installation if you live in a confusing, complicated house like ours. But most people probably won’t need to, and there are plenty of deals and discount schemes from energy companies that should make it a little more easy to swallow.I suspect, as we head through the year of making our house more sustainable, that not all the changes we make will be quite so seamless, comfortable or sacrifice free. But I certainly hope so, because this feels like the kind of change that is incredibly nice to make, not only helping save the world in the tiniest way, but also saving money, and saving us from being cold.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market if the merger hadn\u0027t happened and compete with Just Eat - so it\u0027s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers.

It was the first time since August 2019 that it had registered above 50 points, which marks the line between expansion and contraction.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIHS\u0026nbspMarkit\u0027s chief business economist, Chris Williamson, said: “It seems likely that the rise kills off the prospect of an imminent rate cut by the Bank of England, with policymakers taking a wait-and-see approach as they assess the performance of the economy in the post-Brexit environment.The results of the survey, which is based on reports from managers in offices and factories, were the highest in 16 months and signalled a moderate expansion of business activity across the UK private-sector economy.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

A third of FTSE-listed retailers issued warnings in 2019.The figures came as the retail industry said shops shed 57,000 jobs in 2019 as employment in the once-vibrant high street and shopping centre contracted for the fourth successive year.The British Retail Consortium said the total number of retail employees fell by 1.8 per cent in the final three months of 2019 compared with a year earlier. Full time employment fell by 3.0 per cent and part-time by 1.2 per cent.This was the 16th consecutive quarterly fall, which the BRC said was “proof” that the transformation of the retail industry was ongoing.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive said it was essential the government used its review of the business rates system for a reform of a tax that fall disproportionately heavily on retailers.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also hinted that it may relax\u0026nbspits focus on tackling high inflation as it deals with a combination of slowing productivity and an ageing population, as well as the legacy of the financial crisis.“As our economies are undergoing profound changes, it is the time for a strategy review to ensure we deliver on our mandate in the best interest of Europeans,\u0026nbspECB president Christine Lagarde said on Thursday.Interest rates in the eurozone have been close to zero for the past four years as inflation has stayed below the ECB’s 2 per cent target for almost all of the last nine years. Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But eagle-eyed royal fans spotted a mistake in the trailer for the third season. When Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II is shown celebrating her 1977 Silver Jubilee, the voiceover gets the date of the Queen’s coronation wrong by a year, saying the Silver jubilee was 25 years after the Coronation. It was actually 24 years, as her coronation took place on June 2, 1953.  The ITV fish-out-of-water detective drama stars Rob Lowe as a US police chief who moves to the UK to take up the role of Chief Constable with East Lincolnshire police. He wears four medal ribbons – Diamond Jubilee Medal, Golden Jubilee Medal, Queen\u0027s Police Medal and Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. The trouble is not only are they in the wrong order, but he shouldn’t be wearing any of them. He’s an American who hasn’t previously served in the British police.Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) states that his sister Samantha was abducted by aliens but his recollections of it are contradictory. During hypnotherapy regression therapy, he says he was unable to move at the time, but during flashbacks, he is perfectly able to do so. Mulder is also seen wearing a wedding ring in the season five episode “Travellers. Why had he never mentioned being married? In reality, Duchovny had recently got married. But it added a big change to Mulder’s past.How old is the Doctor? In the classic-era he states he’s anywhere between 500 to several thousand years old. But in the revived series, David Tennant’s Doctor claims he is 904 years old. Unless he’s lying, somewhere along the line, the continuity has slipped up.During Ralphie’s death scene in his kitchen, Tony Soprano is almost blinded by a can of spray, but knocks Ralphie to the floor and kills him. The scene was meant to end with Tony putting his hands on the counter and gasping for air but James Gandolfini, who brilliantly plays Tony, accidentally put his hand down on the oven’s lit burners. The cry of pain was real – but this mistake worked perfectly for the scene.622 Game of Thrones The greatest oops moment in GoT’s was in the final season when a stray Starbucks cup is sitting on a wooden table next to Emilia Clarke’s character Daenerys Targaryen. Did nobody spot it? There were also plastic water bottles near Samwell Tarly’s and Ser Davos’s feet in the final episode.When Marge tells Homer she is pregnant with Maggie in the episode “And Maggie Makes Three”, which first aired in 1995, a picture of Maggie can be seen hanging on the wall of the living room – a right clanger – considering this is before she is even born.The second season of the TV drama is set in October 1984 – a year after the first season. Considering the show trades in nostalgia, you would have thought they\u0027d get the soundtrack right – but they didn’t. Mistakes include The Smith\u0027s song There is a Light That Never Goes Out playing in the background during a flashback between Will and Jonathan. Trouble is, this particular Smiths song wasn\u0027t released until 1986. There was also a motoring error: Barb\u0027s Volkswagon Cabrio was actually made in 1988. In the first season’s episode Provenance, it seems that the actors got a bit lazy, referring to characters by their real names, not their character’s name. Dean appears to call his brother “Jared”, when the character’s name is Sam Winchester and an extra calls the character Dean Winchester “Jensen”, which is again the name of the actor who plays him. It’s one of those shows in which fans searched for hidden clues and meanings. But they picked up on more than intended. In the plane crash scene in the first episode, right before the turbine explodes, a mysterious dark object sweeps upwards only visible to fans sifting through the scene frame by frame. Was it an early manifestation of the smoke monster? No, according to producers, it was just a CGI error.More name mix-ups occur early on in the long-running US sitcom. The aspiring actress Penny, played by Kaley Cuoco, refers to her dad as “Bob”, but once he’s introduced on the show, he is called “Wyatt”. Also there is a plot mistake regarding the broken elevator in the apartment building. When they lug the time machine up the stairs in season one, Leonard explains to Howard that the elevator has been broken for two years. But Howard should know this considering he was there when Leonard blew it up. This is revealed during a flash back in a later episode, where it also states that the event took place five years ago, not two.The BBC hit drama had a continuity error when its star Suranne Jones is seen drinking a glass of wine in her kitchen. As she gulps the wine and texts from her phone, the fridge door in the background is open, then closed, then open – all by itself.1322 Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season one establishes that vampires have no breath – it\u0027s confirmed when Angel is unable to perform CPR. But the vampires talk, pant and even smoke – all which require breathing – while Spike is even tortured by drowning.During a scene in season nine, episode 15 (“The One with the Mugging”), Jennifer Aniston was replaced with a stand-in while her character Rachel was still in shot. She sits at the table at the edge of the frame and is even wearing a different top. In another scene, Phoebe, is chatting to her friend  Monica, but it’s not Monica. It’s Courteney Cox’s body double who has been left carelessly in the shot.Fans laughed out loud when Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) finds Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) injured on the pavement and picks up her mobile to call emergency services. She managed to do it without touching the screen, unlocking her phone or dialling any numbers.1622 Malcolm in the MiddleIn the US sitcom about a dysfunctional family, when Lois walks out holding her ruined dress that is soaking wet to confront her kids, there is a crew member crouching in the hallway holding a bucket.The heartthrob paediatrician Doug Ross, played by George Clooney, had a son prior to his romance with Carol – or did he? Although he mentions the son a few times in season one, he claims later in the series not to have any children.In the first episode of this sci-fi series, the steering wheel has disappeared from the set of the spaceship. Serenity’s pilot Wash, played by Alan Tudyk, can be seen improvising with his hands around an imaginary wheel. It’s hard to believe this mistake wasn’t caught.The mistake actually ended up changing the plot of the series. Supposedly, David Lynch accidentally caught the crew member Frank Silva on camera when his reflection appeared in a mirror in a scene when Laura Palmer was shown screaming. Lynch liked it so much that he decided to keep it in and cast Silva as the character Killer Bob, a dark spirit who haunts Laura.2022 Two and a Half Men Charlie Sheen is seen talking on an upside down iPhone while sitting in a flash red car with a sexily clad woman next to him.The whopper of a mistake did not happen on screen, but in a promotional shot posted online. It was a surprise to see a plastic water bottle perched on the mantle piece behind the Earl of Grantham and Lady Edith considering the series is set in the 1920s. Other mistakes onscreen include a TV aerial on top of a house and double yellow lines on the road.More name mix-ups occur early on in the long-running US sitcom.

Traditionally, fish balls were made of local fish species once widely available in Hong Kong waters. However, due to over-fishing and the industrialisation of food production, the iconic snack is now said to contain only 20 per cent fish or less, with substitute ingredients such as flour, chemical enhancers, pork and lard sometimes making up the bulk of the product.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market if the merger hadn\u0027t happened and compete with Just Eat - so it\u0027s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage - and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Following a well-received show in LA last December, which marked their first performance since 2012, they began announcing a series of other gigs. \u0026nbspA video titled “The Offering” was posted to their Twitter account on 20 January, showing skeletal figures gathering at a forest clearing.

Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London.

Five frozen raw cookies were already up there.Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano was the master baker in December, radioing down a description as he baked them one by one in the prototype Zero G Oven.SpaceX to send Nasa astronauts to space soon, Elon Musk saysThe first cookie — in the oven for 25 minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius) — ended up seriously under-baked. He more than doubled the baking time for the next two, and the results were still so-so.The fourth cookie stayed in the oven for two hours, and finally success.So this time, I do see some browning, Parmitano radioed. I can\u0027t tell you whether it\u0027s cooked all the way or not, but it certainly doesn\u0027t look like cookie dough any more.Parmitano cranked the oven up to its maximum 325 degrees F (163 degrees C) for the fifth cookie and baked it for 130 minutes. He reported more success.Additional testing is required to determine whether the three returned cookies are safe to eat.As for aroma, the astronauts could smell the cookies when they removed them from the oven, except for the first.That\u0027s the beauty of baking in space, according to former NASA astronaut Mike Massimino. He now teaches at Columbia University and is a paid spokesman for DoubleTree by Hilton. The hotel chain provided the cookie dough, the same kind used for cookies offered to hotel guests. It\u0027s offering one of the space-baked cookies to the Smithsonian Institution\u0027s National Air and Space Museum for display.The reminder of home, the connection with home, I think, can\u0027t be overstated, Massimino said. From my personal experience ... food is pretty important for not just nutrition but also for morale in keeping people connected to their home and their Earth.Eating something other than dehydrated or prepackaged food will be particularly important as astronauts head back to the moon and on to Mars.Nanoracks and Zero G Kitchen, a New York City startup that collaborated with the experiment, are considering more experiments for the orbiting oven and possibly more space appliances. What\u0027s in orbit now are essentially food warmers.There\u0027s an added bonus of having freshly baked cookies in space.We made space cookies and milk for Santa this year, NASA astronaut Christina Koch tweeted.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The scientists hope to have a pilot factory producing the batteries within five years at the Berkeley site.The ultimate aim is to have a factory based at one of the former power stations in the South West that takes Carbon-14 isotopes directly from the graphite blocks for use in diamond batteries. This would significantly reduce the radioactivity of the remaining material, making it easier and safer to manage,” said Professor Tom Scott, director of the South West Nuclear Hub.With the majority of the UK’s nuclear power plants set to go offline in the next 10-15 years this presents a huge opportunity to recycle a large amount of material to generate power for so many great uses.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They shine so intensely that they challenge traditional astrophysical models, which have been unable to account for such a bright star.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow scientists think they have found the cause of the blazing brightness coming out of\u0026nbspSN\u0026nbsp2006gy. And they hope that it could shed light on where other such superluminous supernovae get their intensity from.The new breakthrough came when researchers discovered that the star gained its intense brightness when a normal supernova crashed into a shell of material that surrounded it.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

They suggested that vast amounts of iron could account for that particular line, as researchers call it – and when they tested that scenario, it worked.Scientists detect ‘unknown’ burst of gravitational waves in spaceIt became even more exciting when it quickly turned out that very large amounts of iron was needed to make the lines - at least a third of the Sun\u0027s mass - which directly ruled out some old scenarios and instead revealed a new one,\u0026nbspsaid Anders Jerkstrand from the Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University.The researchers suggest that before SN 2006gy\u0026nbspbecame what it is today, there was a double star made up of a white dwarf as big as Earth, and a huge hydrogen-rich massive star the size of our solar system. As the bigger star became even bigger, the smaller one was caught up in it and fell in towards the centre.When it got there, the white dwarf exploded into a Type Ia supernova – a normal supernova. That then collided with the envelope surrounding it, creating the giant collision that sent the light streaming across the universe.That a Type Ia supernova appears to be behind SN\u0026nbsp2006gy\u0026nbspturns upside down what most researchers have believed, says Anders\u0026nbspJerkstrand.That a white dwarf can be in close orbit with a massive hydrogen-rich star, and quickly explode upon falling to the centre, gives important new information for the theory of double star evolution and the conditions necessary for a white dwarf to explode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The police are only contacted if the user requests help, or does not answer their phone.If it is accidentally triggered, the alert process can be stopped by entering a code. However, there is still the risk of false requests.“The false positives, believe me, we took them into account,” said Match chief executive Mandy Ginsberg. “If someone doesn’t respond, worst case someone shows up and knocks on the door. It’s not the worst thing in the world.”Grace Millane’s killer ‘quite taken by morbidity’ says Tinder dateOther new safety features planned for Match’s suite of dating apps include photo verification and an updated in-app safety centre.A recent investigation by ProPublica and Columbia Journalism Investigations found that Match Group did not have a uniform safety policy across its apps and claimed it allowed known sexual predators to use them.The dating giant admitted at the time that it would not know if registered sexual offenders were using its platforms, as it did not collect enough personal information.“As technology evolves, we will continue to aggressively deploy new tools to eradicate bad actors,” a Match Group spokesperson said at the time.Bars and restaurants have previously offered low-tech ways of raising the alarm, including asking for a pseudonymous staff member to alert workers to dangerBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

The petition, addressed to Mr Trudeau, reads: “Canadians wish the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, all the best as they seek financial independence. That goal is important because Canadian taxpayers shouldn’t have to cover the couple’s bills.”The Canadian island rallying to protect Meghan and Harry’s privacyAaron Wudrick, federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, a campaign group “dedicated to lower taxes, less waste and accountable government” told The Independent there was no personal animosity aimed at the royal couple, who are living in the town of North Saanich, 20 miles north of Victoria, the largest town on Vancouver Island.“In the last two weeks I received lots of phone calls from people saying the couple were welcome here, but that they did not want to pay for them,” said Mr Wudrick.\u0026nbsp“I think in recent weeks, that feeling has become more clear. Canada is a welcoming country, but some people excited they are here are viewing them as wealthy celebrities, rather than official members of the royal family where there is a protocol.”Meghan Markle’s father accuses daughter of quitting royal family for moneyHe added: “They are coming here because they want to leave the royal family, but part of that is paying their own bills.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While having offered them a warm welcome, and even helping them avoid media scrutiny, there is a view Canadians should not pay.“I think the point is, they are either private citizens or members of the royal family,” said Bruce Welsh, 70, a former musician and radio show host in Sidney. “If they are private citizens, they should not need security guards.

A petition will not make any difference,” she said.Michael Phillips, 73, who moved to Canada from Britain three decades ago, described himself as an arch anti-royalist. He said he thought the media should leave the couple in peace, but said Canadians should not bear the cost of that privacy.“Canadians should not pay a single cent,” he said. ‘The royal family should be disbanded and they should all be allowed to live their own lives.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University. She had flitted easily between both sides, up until recently, when she moved to Shanghai. “I think the situation in Hong Kong is quite sensitive now, which is easy for people to have conflicts due to different political stands,” she says. “That’s why I’ve decided to leave Hong Kong to work and get away from the intense environment.”Even though the protests in Hong Kong show no sign of abating, Ke remains optimistic unity will overcome ision. She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the contrary, it is an abdication that has sadly plunged him into turmoil.He is a man pulled in opposite directions, torn between patriotic duty and his deep love for his we, between his loyalty to the monarchy and his desire for a new, less constrained role.That explains why, throughout the recent crisis that he and Meghan inflicted on the House of Windsor, his stance has been so confused and contradictory.He speaks of his devotion to Britain but seeks a fresh start in Canada.He expresses his desire to serve but gives up the commitments that go with his position.He trumpets his yearning for privacy, yet he and his we appear keen to set themselves up as a millionaire celebrity couple - hardly the way to avoid attention.He continually wails about media intrusion, yet he resigns as Captain-General of the Royal Marines so he can spend more time on his social media accounts.He and the Duchess endlessly talk about their need for emotional support, yet they have shown little concern for the needs of their own families.Those inconsistencies were graphically exposed in the speech he made on Sunday night at a charity dinner in London to try and justy his recent conduct.His address was given in the immediate aftermath of the deal reached at Sandringham, where he and Meghan agreed to the loss of public funding and the use of their titles infor their independence.It was clear that the saga had exacted a heavy toll on him. In a voice often cracking with emotion, he told his audience that they would “hear the truth from me”.But what they actually heard was a catalogue of embittered anguish.As often, he moaned about the press, which he painted as a sinister, powerful force which needs to be curtailed.Unfortunately, despite all his professed love of Britain, Harry appears to have no understanding that a free, open media is essential to our democracy.He has proved unable to handle any criticism at all – even when it is justied, as in the hypocrisy of his green campaigning while indulging in the use of private jets.It is ashe thinks the media should be filled with fawning sycophants who never scrutinise but just lavish him with praise.That is the kind of regime that belongs to a totalitarian dictatorship, not traditionally liberal Britain.Much of Harry’s hostility to journalists stems from their relationship with his mother. But, however understandable, this is another myth.Princess Diana was not naïve when it came to the press. She was a shrewd, sometimes ruthless operator, who was quite willing to exploit the newspapers when it suited her.With some indignation, he complained that the Sandringham deal was not what he wanted. But it was foolish of him to believe that he and Meghan could have semi-detached Royal status, enjoying its privileges without its obligations.The Queen could never have tolerated that, especially because any commercial deals reached by the Sussexes could have badly compromised her family, just as their cherished fashionable causes could have undermined the Crown.Royalty cannot be a vehicle for self-enrichment or political posturing.The Duke’s inner agony was at its most obvious when he spoke of his regrets for the le he is leaving.Having revealed that he and Meghan were excited to “fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride”, he referred to his “great sadness” at the step they have taken.Yet he claimed that they had “really no other option”. It was another moment of self-deceit, for there were certainly other courses open to them.They could have either stuck to their Royal positions without creating such a psycho drama about themselves, or,they really wanted freedom without scrutiny, they could have retired to live quietly as ordinary citizens, as some other members of the Royal family have done in the past.But such modesty would not have fulfilled their ambitions to be globe-trotting celebrities.It is this craving for fame that highlights the emptiness of Harry’s language about his devotion to service. “I will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his le to supporting the causes, charities and military communities so important to me,” he declared at the charity dinner.Yet this is the same man who was revealed to have touted his we’s voiceover skills to Disney bosses at the London premiere of the Lion King last summer.In the eyes of their critics, the real dedication that Harry and Meghan will probably soon show is to TV deals, book advances, and brand partnerships.In a further attempt to justy their actions, Harry implied that they had been suffering for a long time through the crushing restrictions of Royal le.The final move had been made, he explained, “after so many months of talks and so many years of challenges.”He and Meghan have only been married for  months. A true model of stoical determination, the Queen has been on the throne for almost  years without any public complaint.That just illustrates Harry’s lack of perspective. Insulated by privilege, he has little understanding of the lives of ordinary British citizens, many of whom have endured far greater struggles than anything he has ever experienced.After the Queen had been so publicly generous about him and Meghan in her statement from Sandringham at the weekend, saying that “they will always be much loved members of my family,” it was bad manners of Harry to complain about the deal he had just accepted.He should have responded to his grandmother’s generosity in the same spirit.But what’s done is done. Our monarchy has survived its latest crisis. The moment for recriminations has passed now that a new chapter is about to begin.As he settles in Canada, Prince Harry is bound to miss aspects of his old le in Britain, which even now he describes as “my home and the place I love.And the British public will miss him. At his best, he brought a lovable humour, spontaneity and lack of convention to the Royal Family.We can only hope that now, after taking this drastic decision, he finds the peace that he and Meghan crave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which makes Hall’s defence of the licence fee even more ridiculous.In an era of multiple-choice subscription TV it is absurd for one broadcaster to be funded by a tax enforceable by criminal penalty.It is even more laughable to claim it “ensures independence­ . . . obliges us to serve everyone and reflect every part of the UK”.Hall’s BBC spent his entire tenure turning a deaf ear to half the UK. Hence its shock at last month’s Tory triumph.Hall’s decision to rob over-s of the free licences he agreed to in  was equally outrageous.The idea that the £million cost will harm vital BBC services, when so much of its content amounts to needless competition with commercial rivals, is fatally flawed.His successor must run a smaller Beeb, more in touch with the public, less in the grip of suffocating “wokeness”, focused not on gratuitous expansion but the high-quality shows it does best.This new chief should accept that non-payment of the licence must be decriminalised and the levy finally replaced with a voluntary subscription.Only then will the BBC join the st Century.THE problem with Harry saying he and Meghan had no option but to move abroad to avoid our “powerful media” is that not a word of it is true.It is sheer paranoia to say the Press has done anything but legitimately scrutinise a publicly-funded couple.And the reality is they do not want to avoid media. They want to avoid criticism.Indeed they crave media attentionit meekly writes their PR puff pieces. Corbyn’s Labour is the same.As for having no choice, what drivel.They could have grown up, developed a thicker skin and done their royal duty as they first promised.To pretend that dark forces made them seek a vast fortune as A-list celebs in the LA sunshine is self-serving cobblers.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Prince Charles will see to that.Harry will continue to receive £million from his father, but although Charles has amassed a personal fortune of over £million, the money might not be coming from that closely guarded pot.The prince could instead be paying him through a outdated racket called the Duchy of Cornwall.Charles could claim this as a business expense which means he can reduce the amount of tax he pays. The public would be paying for Harry by the back door.Harry of course has no connection with this sprawling property company called the Duchy, but that has never stopped Charles benefiting from its special tax status.The status of the Duchy has been contested for decades and while Charles insists it is private, thats strongly disputed by others.Charles has also claimed as business expenses the cost of  personal staff to pamper him – butlers, valets, gardeners.He had the cheek to argue that Camilla’s personal costs even before they married were a Duchy expense so claimed for her staff, her travel, her jewellery, and the stabling of her horses.And he got away with it. The line was only drawn when he tried to claim his polo ponies as business expenses.In my time in Parliament I saw plenty of MPs claiming for duck houses, moat cleaning and the like. Is this dferent So what is this Duchy  Well it’s not just in Cornwall where it has land. Its tentacles stretch far and wide. It even owns the Oval cricket ground. Extra cover for the Prince as he hits the taxpayer for six.The Duchy turns in a profit of over £million a year. That is money that many argue should go straight to the Treasury. Instead it becomes pocket money for the Prince.He has reluctantly agreed he should pay tax on this money but the vast array of creative expenses he conjures up means in a recent year when the Duchy made £.million, only £.million was paid in tax at  per cent.That can only be explainedhe dreamed up more than £million in expenses.Charles says the Duchy is a “private estate” — which it is legally, but it acts like a public body that reverts to the Crown when theres no Duke of Cornwall.It has had notices served on it by the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency and they can only be served on a public body.It is the harbour authority for the Isles of Scilly. The Information Commissioner has ruled it is public.But by insisting it is private means the Duchy’s accounting practices can be hidden away. No right of access for the National Audit Office. No freedom of information.If you go cap in hand and bow and scrape, they might let you see some old Duchy paperwork. On the other hand, they might not.In this medieval throwback, Charles scoops up the property of anybody who dies without leaving a will. The general right for a King or Queen to do this was abolished in . But not in the Duchy.Yet this so-called private estate suddenly becomes public when it suits Charles. Unlike any other private estate in Britain, it doesn’t pay any corporation tax or capital gains tax.No wonder Charles is worth over £million.Suddenly the private Prince becomes a public figure, demanding – and getting – the right to change government legislation that affects the Duchy in a way he doesn’t like.To be fair, he does pay the market rent for the vast property he occupies at Highgrove. He pays it to the Duchy which then s the money to him, tax-free, as the Duke of Cornwall in a sort of merry money-go-round.He got Duchy employees to grow trees on Duchy land and then sold the timber to... The Duchy. Charles pocketed £.million tax free for this racket.The Duchy of Cornwall is not some hobby growing a bit of organic lettuce here and there. Nor is it a small collection of twee cottages as you might infer from the pictures the Duchy uses in its publications.No, it is a hard-headed ruthless property company with advantages in tax and law that no other company has.It is a massive money-making machine for Prince Charles, money that rightly belongs to us all but that he erts to himself.It’s time for this medieval monstrosity to be sorted out.

You have to be creative and aggressive and think two steps ahead of the celebrity.”And therein lies the rub. Largely stripped of his royal status, Harry is now a common-or-garden celebrity who has to take his chances with the rest of them in the jungle of hustling for work amid bustling premiere crowds.Then there’s news website TMZ and its myriad wannabe imitations. They’ll be dogging his every move with a video camera, hoping to catch a magical clickbait moment.Its website — together with a frenzied voiceover — is already jokingthat Meghan might sign up for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.As a former actress on cable show Suits,Meghan was of little interest to the Hollywood glitterati and the parasites that feed off them.But now  She’s gold-dust — particularly as her inner circle includes A-listers such as the Clooneys, Serena Williams, Oprah and the Obamas. And therein lies yet another rub. If you attend premieres of movies you’re not in, holiday on rich people’s jets and yachts and hang out at members-only clubs where the hoi polloi are only allowed in to clean up after you . . . then you are wilfully choosing a “celebrity le” and, with that, comes media attention, particularly from the Wild West of online.They need you for clickbait, and you need them to maintain the “popularity” upon which you trade and, without which, you are nothing .Unless, of course, you have a God- given talent like Meryl Streep, Judi Dench, Gary Oldman, Benedict Cumberbatch etc, etc — all of whom put on a suit frock when they have a film to promote but otherwise live a perfectly normal, unremarkable and, therefore, largely “peaceful le” unbothered by the media.Or a member of the British Royal Family who can retreat to one of their many estates for a spot of fishing and contemplation.So . . . “a more peaceful le” outside the protective environs of the monarchy  Dream on.But then, deep down, one suspects that Harry and Meghan both know that and are simply using it as a smokescreen for the real story.His we was homesick, found royal duties restrictive and dull and wanted toto her old le with royal knobs on.And because Harry loves her: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”Good luck to them. Genuinely. But let’s not pretend they had no other option because of something this country did or didn’t do.HARRY and Meghan might be forced to ditch their proposed Sussex Royal brandThe Queen sees it as cashing in on their former royal status.As they’ve already registered it for everything from magazines to mugs, dropping it altogether could prove expensive.So perhaps a little tweak — to  Sussex Royle — might be an easy and appropriate compromise As the incomparable Jim Royle, aka Ricky Tomlinson, might say: “Have their cake and eat it  . . My a***.”SHORTLY after actor Laurence Fox’s sterling, anti-PC performance on Question Time last week, he was predictably hosed down on Twitter by the usual virtue-signalling suspects.Including this from singer Lily Allen.“Sick to death of luvvies like aLawrence Fox going on TV and forcing their opinions on everybody , when he’ll never have to deal with what normal people have to deal with in his gated community.“Stick to acting mate. Instead of ranting about things you don’t know anything about.”Lily, for those in blissful ignorance, is a former public school girl fond of forcing her opinions on everyone  from the comfort of, among other locations, her former mansion in the Cotswolds which, according to Vogue, was: “Hidden away down a deliciously long drive.”That, folks, is what they call irony.Or should we now call it Alleny ROSIE Huntigton-Whiteley says she looks this way because most days she doesn’t eat past pm.She adds that, since having her two-year-old son Jack: “Things don’t sit where they used to, but I’ve come to terms with it.”Yep, I think I could also come to terms with things not sitting where they used tothey sat whereRosie’s things do.EVERY so often, amid all the headlines of gloom and despair, we are bathed in the warm glow that comes from a small slice of humanity.Remember when little Oscar Saxelby-Lee needed a le-saving stem cell donation and thousands  of people from his home city of Worcester queued up to seethey matched Ultimately, a crowd-funding campaign raised £k to send him to Singapore for pioneering treatment and, this week, it was announced that he’s free from cancer.Or what about the two Tesco workers in Southend, Essex, who, upon noticing that a regular customer hadn’t been in, looked through her letterbox and found her lying unresponsive in the hallway.Thanks to them giving a damn, she is now recovering in hospital.Local heroes, every last one of them.THE Duke and Duchess of Cambridge hosted African leaders and our own PM at Buckingham Palace. Is it just me, or do they look like a weight has been lted from their shoulders LABOUR leader hopeful Rebecca Long Bailey was introduced on stage last week as: “Our next Prime Minister.”It took me back to early December, when an avalanche of leaflets cascaded through my letterbox bearing the prediction:  “Jo Swinson: Britain’s next Prime Minister.”And look how that turned out.A SIGN put up by maternity staff at Yeovil District Hospital has angered parents.It reads: “Mummy  Daddy . . . please look at ME when I am feeding. I am much more interesting than your phone.”At first hand, it might seem a little nanny state.But recently a friend whose daughter wasn’t talking much took her to a specialist who told her that children develop the skill to speak from watching their parents’ mouths as they talk.Sowe’re looking at a screen instead of them, chances are they’ll be slower to learn.  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last year .million Chinese and foreign tourists had attended over five days.The Tanzhe Temple Scenic Area, Jietai Temple Scenic Area, and Miaofeng Mountain Scenic Area in Mentougou District will also be closed.Locals in Wuhan, which has a population of  million, have been told not to travel, to avoid crowds and minimise public gatherings despite Chinese New Year being tomorrow.The World Health Organization has yet to declare the virus outbreak as a global health crisis.Beijing is responding to the rapid spread of the virus by building a ,-bed hospital dedicated to patients with coronavirus.Pictures show construction diggers moving earth to lay the foundation for the hospital that officials say will be completed by February .Wuhan authorities said the facility will be on a , square-foot lot and will be modelled on the makesht Xiaotangshan SARS hospital built in in Beijing in .Police, SWAT teams and paramilitary troops have been out on the streets in Wuhan patrolling the railway stations as authorities have banned travelling on subways and ferries.The Sun Online travelled to the deadly epicentre as cases rapidly have continued to skyrocket.Officials have not said when the lockdowns will be lted.John Spencer, chair of Urban Warfare Studies at the US Military Academy Modern War Institute, said it is impossible to shut an entire city down.He told Wired: “It would be nearly impossible to be effective, evenyou threw the entire Chinese military at it.“You’d have to have a coast guard, a military. It’s just not feasible to seal in a major city in the modern age. It wasn’t even feasible before.”Xiao, , a primary school teacher in Wuhan, told : When I saw the news when I woke up, I felt like I was going to go crazy. This is a little too late now. The government’s measures are not enough.Others criticised local authorities on the social media  Weibo as #PrayforWuhan was trending.One said: It’s been a month since the first case was discovered and only now do they think of closing the city  This Wuhan emergency response is a little slow, right   Another added: The government needs to address this. If things become too expensive, people will definitely panic and when people feel unsafe, terrible things happen. Right now people are fighting over supplies, soon they may just be fighting.”Locals have shared images of their stockpiles of instant noodles and snacks on the social media  Weibo.One wrote: No more going out... so I won’t get sick. Hope Wuhan can get some support soon.Supermarket shelves have been left empty as residents have started stockpiling goods to avoid having to leave home and put themselves at risk of contracting the virus.Local authorities are demanding that residents wear face masks in public places, but pharmacies have sold out of the protective gear, while images shared online show food prices have spiked in Wuhan.Cake Liu left Wuhan last week after visiting her boyfriend there and said that while everything was normal then, the situation has since changed rapidly.She said:didnt sleep much yesterday. He disinfected his house and stocked up on instant noodles. Hes not really going out.

It follows a nationwide Wetherspoon policy, which inidual managers can choose to enforce.The poster read: As part of our licensing it is our responsibility to ensure that we are protecting children from harm.Therefore adults in charge of children will be allowed to have one alcoholic drink and a further alcoholic drink with a sit-down meal.It went on to add after the limit had been reached staff would have the legal right to refuse service of alcohol to customers.The boozer said the policy had not been followed rigorously in the past, but it would be taking the ban seriously this year.Being drunk while in charge of a child under the age of seven in a public place is illegal according to the  licensing act and drinkers can face a fine or even a month in prison in more severe cases.The poster has sparked debate on social media.Customer Jonjo OConnell said he agreed with the rule in principle although warned it could be open to abuse.He said: Considering the type of parent it is aimed at, a pub is not a creche and I think some parents seem to forget that!Although I anticipate the rule will be circumvented by some just going around the corner to The Goose and staying there or ing later to the Pocock when a dferent sht arrives.A JD Wetherspoon spokesman said: The manager took the decision to put the poster in the pub to emphasise to customers that she would not allow parents to drink while their children were running round uncontrolled in the pub.The notice had a positive effect, with mostly good feedback."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc boss accepts change london elite","story":"THE bloated BBC is finally sipping expensive champagne in a last-chance saloon surrounded by ­Corbynista socialists.Boris Johnson stands within touching distance of enacting Tory revenge on the Blatantly Biased Corporation, which his genius sidekick Dominic Cummings has been quietly plotting for  years.But an early departure this week by Director-General Tony Hall gives the Beeb one final chance to hire a boss who accepts it must change.A boss who believes its news coverage must represent more than the London remoaning media elite.A boss who knows it is only fair for the BBC to fund the licence fee for those over .A boss who accepts it’s wrong to send people to jail for failing to pay the BBC’s poll tax.It was under those circumstances I apprehensively switched on Newsnight on Monday night to watch nearly the entire show dedicated to navel-gazing about the corporation’s future.Here was the chance to finally prove its news arm could provide fair and critical coverage of the BBC’s very obvious ­weaknesses.So how did they do  Even worse than I expected.In truly bewildering circumstances, BBC presenter Emily Maitlis interviewed four long-time BBC defenders — ista political editor Nicholas Watt, its greatest presenter David Dimbleby, former chairman Michael Grade and unfunny comedian Katy Brand — about how untouchable the BBC is.That propaganda droned on for  ­minutes.When the BBC’s critics finally got a chance, near the end of the show, they got exactly half the time to make their case — just eight minutes and  seconds.Astonishingly, the producers had managed to book three so-called critics who actually seemed to quite like the ­organisation, none of whom called for the abolition of the licence fee.It’s this sort of tone-deaf programming that makes it obvious why BBC News ­completely missed the surge towards Brexit in  and the historic Northern “blue wave” that voted Conservative for the first time last month.The Government is right to ban ­ministers from appearing on Radio ’s increasingly irrelevant and out-of-touch Today programme.Of course, our top politicians should be held to account. Which they are on ­commercial rivals like Nick Ferrari on LBC or Julia Hartley-Brewer on TalkRADIO.At least those stations don’t start from a position of: “Brexit is evil and a majority Tory government isn’t much ­better.”No one is proposing for a single second the BBC be axed. But the poll tax that funds it should be.Its websites that write clickbait about TV shows like Love Island — well ­covered by other online outlets — should be stopped too. Not to mention its recent push into the already saturated podcast market.The BBC’s job is not to be a monolith, shutting out commercial organisations and dominating the entertainment and news industries.That’s what makes yesterday’s decision to axe Victoria Derbyshire’s BBC programme ridiculous.Her award-winning morning show is one of the only news programmes on the ­corporation to properly cover the working class.It is unbiased, feisty, fair and will cover entertainment stories or whatever happens to be the splash of The Sun that day, without the snobbery of the rest of BBC News.That sort of non-commercial show is just the type the Beeb should be making. But — of course — under its latest cuts, it is the first to go.The next Director-General must be an outsider who understands the madness of the BBC’s current priorities and is ­prepared to enact real change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Far East firm plans to pump in £.billion but could also axe  jobs - though unions stressed “signicant numbers have recently left the business”, meaning any new redundancies are likely to be minimised. The unions said in a statement: “Over the past  days there have been detailed discussions and a lot of back and forth between the unions and Jingye but we have reached a point where there is an outcome regarding employee pay, terms and conditions.  “These discussions have been extremely challenging but with British Steel in liquidation it is clear thatthe business is to survive change is required.” They added: “The sale to Jingye is now firmly in sight and we would encourage all stakeholders in the business to focus on reaching a positive conclusion.” Some , people work at the Scunthorpe plant, with another , people employed in the supply chain.

Dad-of-three Michael Carter, , was found unconscious on January  at his Pallister Park, Middlesbrough home. He was rushed to hospital but died in the intensive care unit the following day.An inquest is yet to be heard on the circumstances around his death, but the family believe Michael took his own le, reports Teesside Live. Michaelaposs family believe he was wracked with grief over the recent loss of both of his grandmothers who he was very close to. He had been in prison when his nanna Jean died in July last year. And despite his pleas to attend the funeral and supporting letters from his family, they said he was refused permission to say his final goodbyes. The family is convinced this had a profound impact on his mental health. And while he always had their love and support, Michael would often keep his feelings locked away. The son of Michael and Janice and brother to Joanne, Lyndsey and Jak, Michael grew up in Pallister Park and worked as a steeplejack and was a much-loved member of a very tight-knit family.  He had a gorgeous partner, a good job, nice house and three lovely babies, said Lyndsey. Youaposre just asking questions over why it happened. Joanne, , added: We think a lot of it stemmed from prison and not attending nannaaposs funeral. I do think there should be more support for people in prison and for their rehabilitation. But Michael kept everything to himself, he was a very private person, he wasnapost on social media. He was quite self-conscious and would have been mortied by all the posts for him on social media. I donapost think he realised just how much everyone loved him. Lyndsey agreed.  He wouldnapost do anything to hurt anyone and he wouldnapost have wanted us worrying about him, she said.  We would all have been there for him but I think he just didnapost want us to know about his heartache. We will never get over it. The family believe there is still a lot of stigma around mental health issues, particularly concerning men who are most at risk of suicide Suicide is the biggest single killer of men aged under  in the UK and men are more at risk than women. It is thought they may be more vulnerable because they may feel a pressure to stay strong. Michael was the adored father of Kacie, , Bailee, aged seven, and three-year-old Mason. He lived with them and his partner of  years, Jade, and the couple lived just around the corner from his mum, who he was very close to.  She has been left distraught by her sudden loss, Jade also said there were no signs that Michael was suffering. They had a brilliant Christmas with the family and had just booked a holiday to Spain.    Our Kacie absolutely worshipped him, said Jade. She broke down last night saying she misses her dad and just wants him to come home.   Bailee loved playing games with him. He is a lot like his dad. Jade and Michael got together as teenagers at Keldholme School and were together ever since. I remember we had the last dance at the school disco, said Jade. He was my first love and my last love.  The family are supporting each other and taking comfort in their treasured photos, kind messages of condolence and the sharing of memories. My mam always said Michael was the most accident prone of us all, said Joanne. She said he was never out of hospital and probably broke every bone. Lyndsey laughed as she remembered how Michael could be absentminded at times. He was so laid back and could be a little bit docile, she said. One time my mam sent him out to get fish and chips and he came back saying, aposWhat did you want again, a Gazette !apos  He was beautul, he took mamaposs eyes and we called him Mickey Blue Eyes. Michael was also the joker, they recalled. Joanne told how, after a couple of drinks, he would call himself aposAunty Michelleapos. And when his mum came back from a holiday to Mexico, Michael slathered himself in fake tan so he would still have the best tan. Jade said: He was so orange I said to him, aposIf Rudolph is ill on Christmas Eve this year, at least you can guide Santaaposs sleigh!

Macy Foley-Speakman, from Warrington, Cheshire, used to be so self-conscious about her skin that she avoided looking at herself in the mirror.Her skin first started to crack and flare up when she was just three months old - and it sometimes becomes so inflamed it turns purple, the Liverpool Echo reports.Her mum Maxine, , said strangers stare at her daughter in the street and make rude comments about her, causing the youngster to become embarrassed about what she looks like. However, Macy has overcome the challenges caused by her condition and is now the face of an eczema-friendly MS clothing line. Her mum Maxine said people used to stop and askher daughter had chicken pox. She added: People donapost realise how hard it is. Macy would ask why people are staring and then she stopped looking in the mirror, she would just refuse to look at herself.Macyaposs eczema became so bad that mum Maxine gave up her full-time job as a nursery nurse to care for her daughter. The hands-on mum has since spent the last eight years learning as much as she can about the condition, even creating a Facebook page in the hope of educating others.Macyaposs dad Andrew, , also suffers with the condition and like his daughter, often has to go to hospital for treatment. In a bid to control her eczema which can sometimes become so inflamed her skin turns purple, the schoolgirl has have lotion applied seven times a day.  She also requires special zinc bandaging to soothe the inflammation during flare-ups. At school the pupil is allowed to wear a cotton unorm rather than polyester and her school friends, who have known her since reception, even help the youngster not to scratch her skin. Maxine, who has been moved to tears by how kind and supportive Macyaposs classmates are, said: Her school and headteacher have been really understanding and she has never been bullied. Her friends even hold her hands when sheaposs itchy to stop her from scratching. But the real turning point for Macy was when she was at home, watching TV and said to her mum no-one looks like me.Which is when, instead of becoming down about her condition, Macy decided she wanted to take it in her stride and try to become a model - championing eczema. And when the Eczema Outreach Support charity came into her school she took the opportunity to approach the team, who reached out to MS - who advertise eczema-friendly clothing line DreamSkin. Macyaposs great-grandmother Jean Guinan, who was a model for MS in the s, passed away in . Mum Maxine told the ECHO how her daughter would love getting dressed up for her Nana Jean to keep her spirits up in hospital and said she would be so proud to see her now.

Mandeep Singh Chatha’s off-licence has become a tourist attraction in Wolverhampton after he erected the sign in orange lettering. Customers have been lining up to take selfies outside his Singh’sbury Local that – some say – looks like a Sainsbury’s. But former sandwich delivery driver Mandeep, , insists there is an innocent explanation, saying: “I decided on the name. My name is Singh and it’s on Bushbury Road. It’s just a coincidence. I think the nearest Sainsbury’s is a couple of miles away so it’s not exactly close and we are certainly not competition. “I am just a small business owner trying to make a living.“People keep stopping in their cars to take pictures with the sign and I’ve had many nice comments. “I have heard nothing from a supermarket which has a similar name, so I see no problem with it. “It’s a dferent logo, a dferent colour, a dferent company. Its a completely dferent.  The former sandwich delivery driver, who opened the store last month, has even registered ‘Singh’sbury Local’ on Companies House. In  businessman Jel Singh Nagra renamed his North Tyneside shop Singhsbury’s. After Sainsbury’s threatened legal action, he renamed the store Morrisinghs – and Morrisons backed the idea.

Saleswoman Michele Kobke says she has been in love with the -tonne jet for the past six years - even describing it as the love of her le. The -year-old German is now planning to wed the Boeing - after first locking eyes on the aircraft through the window at Berlinaposs Tegel airport. Michele says she was first attracted to the Boeingaposs wings, winglets and thrusters. But she has only managed to meet aposhimapos twice, admitting when she canapost be close to the plane she cradles its components in bed at night. But the besotted romantic has an affectionate nickname for her mechanical aposfiancéapos -  aposSchatz,apos which means aposdarlingapos. After six years of only being able to aposmeetapos the aircraft through the glass window of the airport, in September , she was finally able to get up close. In September , she was able to kiss it and even stand on one of its wings in the hangar. And now her dreams are likely to come true as her thoughts turn to marriage. Unlike a traditional wedding, Michele doesnapost want to wear a white gown and veil. Instead, she imagines wearing black trousers and a black blazer on her big day.  She has plans to meet the plane again in a hangar in Amsterdam, on March , . While her friends and family have accepted her relationship, her family are not interested in meeting Schatz and she wants her wedding to be an intimate affair. The time in the hangar was the most beautul moment of my le and when I was with him, we enjoyed our time together, we kissed and I caressed him, Michele said. The hangar is home for Schatz and me we can enjoy our time together undisturbed there. I plan to move into the hangar one day and my biggest dream is to be with Schatz and to live with him. I also want to marry him in the hangar and spend the whole night with him. I wouldnapost want to put on a white dress, but dress really smartly with black trousers and a black blazer. I want to have someone to marry us and say, aposdo you want to marry your -apos and I say, aposyesapos, we kiss and then Iaposm immortalised with him and we can be together forever. Michele has met him twice so far - both times last year. She spends time with parts of the Boeing to stay connected to aposSchatzapos while they are apart. I sleep with my darling every night, either with real components like the spoiler, flap track fairing and tank valve or five-foot-two model intimacy is part of our relationship.  Experts call this type of love affair objectophilia, where a person is attracted to an inanimate object. People with this preference may have strong feelings of attraction, love and commitment to certain items or structures of their fixation.

Twitter user Kimberley Harrington tweeted screenshots of the ad which quickly went viral as people were stunned at the mumaposs ambitious list of requirements.aposLook I know what day it is and where I’m posting this but I still challenge you to find ANYTHING more bananas bat sh*t than THIS. I DARE YOU,apos Harrington wrote.  The ad didnapost identy the CEO or the company she runs in San Franciscoaposs Silicon Valley.However it noted she is based in city Menlo Park, home to the headquarters of countless start-ups and tech giants including Facebook.The job description shared by the CEO included a formidable list of desired qualities. Major responsibilities are keeping the household family and staff and its processes and programs well organized, cooking organic foods that meet our allergy requirements, planning vacations, camps and after school activities, errands, and spending time with the kids,apos the job description reads.   Whoever gets the position will have to agree to a scheduleof five days a week aposapproximately .am to .pm Sunday- Thursdayor Monday-Friday apos. aposMom is a CEO and needs to relax on weekends. Weekends are busy with sports and play dates. Live-in option is the full kitchen, one-bedroom pool house.apos The ad said the CEO was looking for an intelligent multi-tasker with a university degree or equivalent, who will also need to help her children with homework and play maths games with them. An example of a maths game the nanny would be expected to play was included in the ad: aposHow much fish should we buy today for five of us apos  The nanny would also be expected to organise the familyaposs vacations, alongside budgeting and organising the housework using spreadsheet tools. aposConduct research into domestic and global vacation options based on criteria, populate information into a simple Excel spreadsheet, recommend and book vacations, track vacation expenses in Excel including track vacation home deposits getting ed.apos The nanny was also expected to organise the childrenaposs social lives and chores.

Others suggested anyone qualied to meet all her requirements deserved a six-figure salary. While another joked they thought the ad was going to end with: This is an unpaid internship.  Naima Cochrane wondered whether the perfect candidate even existed, writing: First of all, this is an actual IMPOSSIBLE list of qualications - literally impossible.

Brooklyn Ann had another theory, writing: I bet you the mother wrote this to prove a point to her husband when she askedthey could hire help and he probably said something dismissive of her parenting household work like, Fine, but I donapost see why you need any help.

What should have been the happiest day of her le was completely ruined because she spent the day knocking back detox shakes, resulting in disaster when she gambled on a fart and lost in a big way. She ended up ruining her £, dress, but refused to let that get that stop her from having a first dance with her husband in front of their nearest and dearest. But things went from bad to worse and ended up with the couple feeding each other wedding cake with poo-stained hands. The wedding planner was first alerted to the issue when she heard the dreaded words we have an issue over her headset. She took to Reddit to share the horrying details, which she admits still make her cringe. Her post has attracted more than , comments with most users being pretty grossed out by the turn of events and others labelling her a hero and a champ. Things didnapost exactly start well, and the planner claims the bride had been quite the bridezilla from day one. She wanted the reception to take place in a historic barn at one of the family properties, which caused numerous issues.  It had no water or electricity, leaving the planner to arrange for a bank of generators, buckets of water, additional auxiliary tents - as the barn wasnapost big enough to house all the guests. After hearing what had happened the planner told guests there would be a short delay before heading to the loo to help her poor assistant, who was cleaning the bride off with toilet paper. She claims the bride had let out a substance no human body should emit. She writes: Iaposm just looking at her manicured nails. Residue of diarrhea are just embedded in her nail bed. I start trying to scrape the poo out with a fabric stain wipe.  But the bride insisted the show went on. Despite the stench that she brought out of the bathroom with her - which the groom noticed - the newlyweds took their place on the dance floor to start the choreographed number. The planner writes: As the groom spun his bride around, hand on her waist, he is squishing the poo up the insides of the waist trainer, up and out the back waistband. To our horror, we watch as a oily stain spread across the mid back of the gown. As we are still cringing from this, the groom sets his hand firmly in the middle of the poo stain.

Kharn Lambert, who lives in Wuhan, is concerned about his -year-old grandmother, Veronica Theobald, who has COPDand is visiting him from the UK. She is running low on medication and is unable to travel home because flights out of Wuhan have been grounded until further notice. The PE teacher, from Lancaster, Lancashire, left his home for the first time in days on Friday to buy food, and he wore a mask and immediately washed his clothes and had a shower when he ed from the largely deserted streets. The -year-old said panic and fear had settled over the city of million people, which has been locked down in a desperate bid to control the SARS-like virus that has killed at least  and infected more than  others. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. Mr Lambert said the cityaposs normally bustling streets are now dead with public transport halted and people forced to stay in Wuhan during the Lunar New Year holiday, which is usually filled with public celebrations and feasts. Residents have been told not to travel and the streets are largely deserted, creating an eerie scene that is like something out of a Hollywood film. Mr Lambert, who has been teaching in Wuhan for six years, toldfrom his home: Itaposs hard to describe the feeling really, itaposs not like anything Iaposve experienced before, knowing that youaposre in a city that is essentially a no go zone seems like something from a movie. At the moment I donapost have any personal fears, I am doing what I can to keep myself safe.  My only fear is my grandmother, she is  and visiting me here in Wuhan, she has COPD and is very vulnerable. She was due to fly home next Monday, but her flight was cancelled. She has enough medication to last her another week or so, but I am worried about how I am going to get her more medication. However, I am in contact with the British Embassy to resolve the situation, and hopefully get her more medication or evacuate her from the city. Mr Lambert said he left his home for the first time in days on Friday to stock up on supplies and he took a number of precautions to protect himself. He said: I left the house for the first time today. I had to go and get some food shopping, but as soon as I got home I wiped down all the packaging with disinfectant, threw all my clothes straight in the wash and showered.  I was scared that I might bring something into the house that would infect my grandmother. Essentially I just wore my every day clothes and a mask, I just made sure that I didnapost come into close contact with other people while I was out. Describing the mood in Wuhan, he said: The atmosphere is very sombre, Wuhan is normally a vibrant city, but I think people are starting to understand the seriousness of the situation now and only leaving houseabsolutely necessary. The majority of restaurants, bars, entertainment centres are closed, those that are open are empty. Yesterday, there was a sense of panic and fear, but I think that was caused by the way the lockdown was handled. News about the lockdown started to trickle out around am in the morning, eight hours before the lockdown started, but most people were in bed at that time so essentially they only had three or four hours to prepare for it when they woke up.Thataposs where the panic or fear set in for most people and thataposs why we saw people dashing for the supermarkets and we saw all of these scuffles.But I went to the supermarket today and the atmosphere as I said is very sombre now. Mr Lambert is hoping his grandmother will be able to fly back to the UK soon, and he isnapost surehe will join her. He said: I am unsure about what I will do at this moment. I think I will keep an eye on the situation and listen to the advice of the Foreign Office and my employers. About  to  Britons live in Wuhan, he said.  The Foreign Office had advised against all but essential travel to the city. Mr Lambert hailed the medics who have been run off their feet working on the front line to treat infected patients and prevent the virus from spreading. He said: Itaposs easy to bemoan and criticise the response from the government here in China, but this really couldnapost have happened at worse time for China, and I donapost think they could have contained it any better than what they have.People have been travelling for weeks and weeks preparing in advance for the Chinese New Year, so I want I just want to say I am with Wuhan, and I want to thank all those on the front line that are dealing with this crisis. Earlier, an Irish teacher living in Wuhan told how he had been holed up in his flat for two or three days as the outbreak unfolded. Ben Kavanagh, who is on a break from work due to the Lunar New Year holiday, said he would have to leave his home soon and venture out into the ghost town to stock up on food.  When he does, he will wear a surgical mask over his mouth and nose and swimming goggles over his eyes to protect himself. Mr Kavanagh told RTE Radio’s Morning Ireland:“You are allowed out, but there are so many rumours and people are worried, it’s better not to. “It’s almost like a ghost town.” Mr Kavanagh said there were fears the virus can spread through contact with the eyes and as a result people were wearing eye protection in addition to masks. He added: “I have enough water for a few more days, but I will probably have to head out to the shops for food.” The teacher plans to wear a mask over his face and swimming goggles over his eyes when he leaves his flat.  “I have no idea what to expect,” he said. He said a dual carriageway near his home is normally very busy but is now quiet, and Mr Kavanagh has heard that the price of some items at the supermarket, including celery, had tripled amid the panic in Wuhan. A British teacher working in Wuhan said he has been told not toto the city after he left earlier in the week to go travelling. The former Leeds University student, who asked to remain anonymous, said he lives near the live animal and seafood market where the outbreak is suspected to have occurred. He told the PA news agency: Iaposve been told not toto China as itaposs in lockdown around the city and my school is closed.  I plan on continuing to travel past my planneddate by a couple of weeks and thenthe place is still a no go, go back to the UK andwhen I can. Itaposs a pain as all my stuff is in my flat and Iaposm really sad as I love my job and hope to be back as soon as possible. If I hadnapost been out the country when I heard about the lockdown - a few hours before it happened - I would have got out the city with all my stuff and come back to the UK. He said the outbreak started before Christmas but it took several weeks before panic started to spread: There wasnapost any visible panic but the parents of kids were wanting information from anyone before the government released any. Then all the information was released New Yearaposs Day and in the early hours of the morning they closed down the market. I walk through that market daily. It was your typical Asian meat market, with everything on display from legs of meat to crabs and fish. The Chinese government have said that illegal sales did occur inside which is where the source is but there was no indication of this from the outside.  Most of my mates are out of the city for the spring festival but a couple are still there and feeling scared mixed with concern. Itaposs mainly inconvenient for them as they canapost do anything at all whilst theyaposre there, apart from stay inside. I donapost know whataposs happening with the jobs or businesses that wonapost be doing anything. He said he was hoping toto the city at the end of Februarythe city reopens. Videos have emerged on social media showing people with suspected cases collapsed in the streets or on floors at hospitals and clinics. Another clip allegedly shows three dead bodies on the floor of a Wuhan hospital as a corridor is packed with patients wearing masks and staff in protective suits. The virus has killed at least  people and infected more than  others during in China, where at least ten cities are on lockdown, essentially trapping more than million residents. The new strain of the flu-like virus has started to spread around the world, with confirmed cases in the US, Singapore and South Korea, and more than a dozen people being tested in the UK after they showed signs of the disease. In China, Lunar New Year celebrations have been cancelled and entertainment venues, including Shanghaiaposs Disney resort, have been shuttered in a desperate bid to prevent the disease from spreading even further. A section of the Great Wall of China has also been closed to tourists. In a statement, the Shanghai Disney Resort said: In response to the prevention and control of the disease outbreak and in order to ensure the health and safety of our guests and cast, Shanghai Disney Resort is temporarily closing Shanghai Disneyland, Disneytown including Walt Disney Grand Theatre and Wishing Star Park, starting January , . We will continue to carefully monitor the situation and be in close contact with the local government, and we will announce the reopening date upon confirmation. The theme park had planned a Year of the Mouse celebration to coincide with Lunar New Year festivities and the beginning of the Year of the Rat.  It is one of the busiest weeks of the year for Shanghai Disneyland. There are fears the new coronavirus will spread rapidly as hundreds of millions of Chinese residents travel domestically and abroad for the seven-day Lunar New Year holiday, which began on Friday. Hospitals in Wuhan - where the outbreak began late last month - are running out of masks, goggles and protective suits as the number of cases soars. At one overwhelmed hospital, a tent city has been set up in a car park to treat patients because there is no room inside, and workers in Wuhan are racing to build a ,-bed hospital in less than a week to cope with the crisis. In Hong Kong, a couple who fell ill following a trip to Wuhan were caught trying to flee a hospital where they were being put into isolation. It is believed the virus was passed from animals to humans at a market in Wuhan in central China. The market, which traded in illegal wildle and has since been shut down, sold live animals and seafood and many of the first patients had either worked there or visited.

Hospitals in Wuhan have been overwhelmed by the crisis, with hundreds of patients arriving every day to be tested. At least  people have been killed so far and more than  others have been infected, according to Chinaaposs official figures, but the toll could be much higher. Some hospitals have run out of beds - forcing them to set up tents in car parks to treat new patients - and most are running out of supplies, including masks, goggles and suits, as medics are run off their feet. One video posted on social media in China allegedly shows medics and patients walking around three dead bodies on the floor of a hospital struggling to cope with the crisis. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. The outbreak began late last month in Wuhan, a city of million people, and it is believed to have originated at a market that sold live animals, including illegal wildle, and seafood. Some experts believe the virus may have been passed from snakes to humans, and the snakes may have been infected by bats. Wuhan has been locked down, with residents being told to stay put at home while flights out of the city are grounded and train, bus and ferry services are cancelled.  With hospitals and clinics struggling to keep up, Wuhan is building a new ,-bed hospital and it wants to open it within six days. Builders have set the ambitious target of completing the hospital by Monday. The new hospital is being built around a holiday complex originally intended for local workers, set in gardens by a lake on the outskirts of the city, the official Changjiang Daily reported on Friday.  Prefabricated buildings, which will have , beds, will be put up, it said. Building machinery, including  diggers and  bulldozers, arrived at the site on Thursday night, with the aim to get the new facility ready by Monday, the paper added. The construction of this project is to solve the shortage of existing medical resources, the report said.  It added: Because it will be prefabricated buildings, it will not only be built fast but it also wonapost cost much. China State Construction Engineering, one of the companies building the hospital, said on Friday it was doing all it can and would overcome dficulties to play its part, adding it now had more than  workers on the site. Images on state television showed a flurry of activity at the muddy building site with dozens of diggers painted in multiple colours hard at work preparing the ground, as a stream of trucks ferried in materials and equipment.  It emerged on Friday that  military doctors and nurses have been sent to the intensive care unit at Wuhanaposs Lung Disease Hospital to help overwhelmed staff.

Footage shows the woman holding the bat with enormous chopsticks and nibbling on its wings. Bat soup is a delicacy in the country and a popular dish in Wuhan, where the virus originated. While the woman appears tentative about her meal, her partner gets stuck in, removing the bataposs skin and and pulling the meat from bones. A man can be heard telling the woman in Mandarin: Eat the meat! [Donapost] eat the skin. He added: apos[You] should eat the meat on its back. The couple appeared to be sharing a large pot of bat soup, placed in the middle of the table. Coronavirus first broke two weeks ago, claiming  lives in the country so far and affecting  people. Other suspected cases have been reported in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, UK, the US and Vietnam. Researchers in China claimed the fatal strain of coronavirus shares a common ancestor with a virus found only in fruit bats.In a statement, the researchers said: “The Wuhan coronavirus’ natural host could be bats … but between bats and humans there may be an unknown intermediate. Bats are popular in Chinese medicine, believed to cure a range of illnesses like malaria and and coughing.  Its faeces is thought to cure eye ailments. The disease is little understood and scientists now claim the virus could stem from snakes. The WHO on Thursday declared the outbreak an emergency for China but stopped short of declaring the epidemic of international concern.Dr Tedros, the director-general of WHO, said: We know that most of those who have died had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease, that weakened their immune systems.

I think in this league teams can be inconsistent and, probably, Dundee have been like that themselves throughout this season,” he added.“Hopefully, I can come and help that. I’ve been in the league before with Raith and in the play-offs, too. I’ve been there and done it all before.”Although keen to kick on and help the Dark Blues this term, Callachan is just happy to be playing again after enduring a long spell out of the team at Saints.He only made four appearances for the Perth men this season, the last coming in September, and is enjoying feeling wanted again.“I’m hungry to play, do well and help the team,” he said defiantly.“I want to get games under my belt because it was frustrating at St Johnstone.“You’re sitting in the stands and you feel you can help the team but the manager thought otherwise.“I’m just happy somebody wants me here and I feel like I’ve fitted in right away.“Hopefully, I can go and play and show what I can do.“The initial attraction was Dundee were interested in me. My head was turned right away.“Obviously, not playing at St Johnstone made me want to come here.“The plan is to help the club get to where it wants to be, back in the Premiership.“We’re in the play-off spots now so, hopefully, we push and climb up to second.“Dundee United are going to win the league so the main thing for us is getting to the play-offs and going up that way.“We want to finish as high as possible.”Playing alongside and learning from quality players like Graham Dorrans is another reason why Callachan was happy to make the switch up the A, across Tayside.And he was delighted to see his team-mate sign a new deal this week.“He’s, obviously, played at a right high level and you can tell he’s a good player who can help the team.“Him signing a new deal can only be good for us.“It’s good for everyone we have that competition.“It’s good for the club and for the boys, competition is always good.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e184ad61963d8.69056156.jpg ","title":"dee closing in on wigan wide man ollie crankshaw","story":"Dundee are looking to bolster their squad with the loan signing of Wigan youngster Ollie Crankshaw.The -year-old winger is set to check in at Dens Park until the end of the season as Dee boss James McPake seeks to increase his options in wide areas.With Josh McPake and Josh Todd having now left the club, Crankshaw would come straight into the first-team picture – something the Latics are keen for him to do.The Championship side want him to cut his teeth at a higher level with his only previous experience coming in non-league football with the likes of Curzon Ashton, Colne and Clitheroe.Gaffer James, meanwhile, has heaped praise on one man he has already got in on loan – Ross Callachan.The St Johnstone midfielder made his debut in dark blue in the - Scottish Cup loss to Motherwell at the weekend.Despite a poor performance overall, James was happy with his new charge, saying: “He’s really short of match practice but he added a dferent dimension to what we’ve got.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

But what it will be is something that is modular that we can add ontowe need to for capacity and we will want to talk to the community about what  we might want to put into that site.A consultation will take place asking for local feedback on community space and the possible provision of health and social care.She added: ldquoSome people have said to me that they want to knock all of the school down including the fairly new bits, realistically that wonrsquot happen and itrsquos not the right thing to do. I think itrsquos important that we make sure people understand the parameters within which we are working so we can have some sensible conversations and that we try and accommodate as much as we can in there.Meanwhile, a major operation is underway to get the students back to their classrooms at the beginning of February.The Chief Executive said: ldquoWe put in arrangements for  plus pupils to be accommodated at locations in Peebles, Galashiels Academy and the Langlee complex.ldquoThat has been generally very successfully and the feedback from that has been positive. I absolutely acknowledge that itrsquos not perfect but it has done the job we needed it do to.Senior students are currently sitting prelim exams in the Sports Complex and this will continue until the end of January.Temporary classroom units are being erected within the school grounds and pupils are to be accommodated in unaffected areas of the building.ldquoThere are still huge amounts of work going on and we will go right up to the wire but Irsquom confident we will achieve it, added Ms Logan.The Council has decided on a phased approach with S to S students starting on Monday, February  and S to S working from home and ing the following day.Ms Logan said that there has been ldquocompromises in the education offer over the last few weeks but is assuring parents that from the beginning of February it will be ldquobusiness as usual.Demolition work on the damaged building has been completed and restricted access has been implemented.The council boss has assured parents that children will only be able to access safe routes throughout the school building.Ms Logan added: ldquoOne of the things we did lose in the fire was the vast majority of pupil toilets so what wersquove now got on site is the long term temporary arrangements supplemented over the course of January.To ensure pupil safety, traffic will enter the site from a new access via Craigerne Road located at the back of the school.Ms Logan is meeting with insurers this week to discuss a settlement figure which will help form the direction of the future of Peebles High School.She added: ldquoAll of what we are doing is going to be sustainable for whatever we do in terms of the proper rebuild.\"What Irsquom trying to reassure you is that wersquore not doing things that are very temporary, whatever we do, we will be looking to the future.Community councillor Graham Mackie commended the local authority on doing a ldquoremarkable job and said any criticism of the Council during this trying time was unnecessary.He said: ldquoIt has been thought for several years that we needed a completely new high school but possibly therersquos a silver lining here in that we can end up with a high school that will meet the needs of the current population.\"But the council chief told members that ldquoessentially this is the replacement.She explained: ldquoWhen it comes to looking at high schools and replacement we would always look to retain what is still workable.\"In the case of the bits we are talking about in terms of Peebles High site they are really not that old. The Millennium Wing meets the standards that would be required in a new building. There would be very little point in wasting money knocking down something that works really well.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters.

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year.

Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum.

Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat.

No, we donrsquot have a high-value economy any more, like Irelandrsquos or Norwayrsquos, largely because of being a backwater in the UK for the last half century. But Scotland could still offer the national income of Portugal with the population of Slovakia.:Nicola Sturgeon to set out plan for Scottish independence referendum next weekSo, we can forget the  nonsense about going to the end of the queue or being blocked by Spain. There is now a reservoir of goodwill, especially in the European Parliament, following Scotlandrsquos determined resistance to Brexit. Wersquod be back in, probably within - years according to Kirsty Hughes of the Scottish Centre on European Relations.However, there is one small problem. Scotland would have to be fully independent first. Unless Scotland has a referendum in this transition year there is no longer any prospect of Scotland, as it were, remaining in the European Union as rUK leaves. We may still be under the same regulatory environment as Europe in the transition period, but donrsquot think that can just be extended as in Northern Ireland.Mentioning the Irish backstop is not the way to get a sympathetic hearing in the European Union. Many states are unhappy about Northern Ireland being allowed to remain, effectively, in the European single market without being part of the EU or the EEA.It breaks all the rules. And Scotland can forget about being given similar treatment. Speaking to Brussels officials this week confirms that there will be no read-across to Scotland from the Northern Ireland protocol. They wonrsquot even discuss it.So, there is no half way house. Scotland needs to take the leap into full independence. That means having a central bank and an autonomous currency before Scotland could become a candidate for accession. There are two problems here, but they arenrsquot insurmountable.Scotland would have to formally agree to the Maastricht Treaty, and membership of the euro. It is most unlikely that Scotland would get a formal opt-out from the euro, but it could drag its feet for a very long time, like Sweden. Whether Scotland would want to is another matter. Euro membership has worked well for many small countries.A more dficult issue is convergence. Scotland would have to show that its economy meets the terms of the stability pact, which means having a deficit of less than three per cent. At present, according to the GERS figures, Scotland has a deficit of more than twice that.However, after independence these numbers would almost certainly change. There will be a lot of fiscal give and take between Scotland and the rest of the UK over assets and liabilities.But Scotland would have to show that it is capable of harnessing its currency to the euro, evenit doesnrsquot actually join it. Currency autonomy might be hard to establish , as in the Scottish Governmentrsquos scenario, Scotland keeps using the pound for a decade after independence.: In post-Brexit Britain, Nicola Sturgeon cant keep telling her troops that Indyref is round the corner. It isntIf a nominally independent Scotland were still subject to interest rates operating in a country that is outside the European Union, that would be a dficult sell. The EU is very good at finding novel ways to get round problems like this. But it might take a few years.There may be a trade deal on regulations between the UK and the EU that solves some of Scotlandrsquos accession and border problems. We just donrsquot know. This is one of the imponderables of Scottish independence. It is actually very dficult to make a clear prospectus for indyref when we donrsquot yet know how the UK is going to stand in relation to the EU.But there is a bigger question than all of these: would Scotland necessarily want to rejoin the European Union  Nicola Sturgeon takes it as read, but there would be a debate at the very least. Around a million Scots voted for Brexit and many of them were supporters of independence.Brussels has had some bad press in the last decade. Austerity policies were imposed after  which were worse than in the UK and caused problems across the Mediterranean states. Its behaviour toward Greece during the sovereign debt crisis would have shamed the British Empire at its worst.Brussels stood idly by while one member state, Spain, imposed draconian repression in Catalonia, breaking heads and locking up elected politicians. There was scarcely a word from Brussels, let alone sanctions. Then there is fish.Many in the independence movement believe the EU is a neoliberal club ndash which it is ndash and would be happier with an arrangement like Norwayrsquos which has control of fishing grounds, is not subject to EU rules and has a managed economy. The case for a referendum before Scotland rejoined the EU would seem to me to be unanswerable.At the very least, the SNP could not take it for granted. Unionists will continue to argue that it makes little economic sense for Scotland to leave the Union with the UK, which is where the majority of Scottish exports go. There would be a hard border, currency controls, possibly tarfs.Ms Sturgeonrsquos problem is that the very arguments the SNP used against leaving the European Union ndash freedom of movement, zero tarfs, regulatory harmony ndash apply equally to leaving the United Kingdom. Theyrsquoll come winging back. Aversion to Boris Johnson may not be enough to persuade Scots to take the biggest leap in  years.Read more: Sturgeon cant keep telling her troops that Indyref is round the corner"},{"url":null,"title":"helen-mcardle-disappointing-see-evidence-bias-conflicts-interest-hidden-data-science","story":"It is interesting then that in the past week two separate papers - in respected journals, the Lancet and BMJ - have highlighted shortfalls blighting the reliability of clinical trials and studies.Neither attracted much coverage outside of the science press, which is a pity as this is an important and neglected issue. But sadly not a new phenomenon.: Dental attendance rates at record low in ScotlandThe Lancet study - by Oxford University researchers - found that fewer than half of US clinical trials have complied with the law on reporting results, despite regulations brought in three years ago that stipulated a one-year deadline.Non-reporting of clinical trial results has been well documented since the s, especially in trials which found no evidence of effectiveness for the treatment being tested.But failing to disclose disappointing trial results distorts the overall evidence base: evidence of ineffectiveness is equally important - it is just less potentially profitable.The authors say that the high rates of non-compliance found in the new study likely reflect the lack of enforcement by regulators, despite laws allowing them to charge up to , a day in delay penalties.Dr Ben Goldacre, who led the study, said: ldquoPatients and clinicians cannot make informed choices about which treatments work best when trial results are routinely withheld...Our study has identied over , trials breaching the rules, but to our knowledge the FDA has never levied a single fine.\"Meanwhile, the BMJ study - published yesterday - looked at the funding of patient groups by the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.

.m cubic metres out of .m cubic metres - was for horticultural use and the rest for other uses such as animal bedding, domestic fuel, whisky production and mushroom compost.But there remains uncertainty about the true extent of extraction in Scotland.Scottish Natural Heritagevideo highlightingthe benefits from restoring peatlandsA letter seen by the Herald sent to all heads of planning at local authorities across Scotland in November highlights concerns relating to peat sites that are either classied as dormant or where no extraction has taken place for some time while confirming plans to phase out the use of peat for horticultural purposes.\"In such cases, there is potential uncertainty around the future intentions of the operator and the status of the land,\" said John McNairney, the Scottish Government local government and communities directorate chief planner.In , it was estimated that there were  sites in Scotland known to be actively extracting peat but reviews have revealed there are a number of sites with an unknown status.\"The Scottish Government resisted further legislation in this area because it believes that the existing order making powers available to planning authorities are sufficient to deal with the issue,\" said Mr McNairney.:Call for urgent action to protect and restore important peatlandsPlanning authorities have powers to ban the resumption of minerals developmentno development has been carried out to any substantial extent for a period of at least two years and where, on the evidence available, it appears that development is unlikely to resume.\"The intention of these orders is to establish without doubt that minerals development has ceased, to ensure that development cannot resume without a fresh grant of planning permission and to secure the restoration of the land,\" said Mr McNairney.\"The Scottish Government believe that existing prohibition order making powers provide the due process for extinguishing planning permissions and that wider use should be made of these powers in respect of peat sites where resumption of development is unlikely,\" he said.\"Compensation is less of an issue with prohibition orders since the value of the mineral that cannot be worked is not taken into account when calculating the amount of compensation payable.\"Current Scottish planning policy only permits commercial extraction in areas suffering historic, signicant damage through human activity and where the conservation value is low and restoration is impossible.But a  review of commercial peat extraction in Scotland carried out by the International Union for Conservation of Nature seen by the Herald states that the Scottish Government does not hold up-to-date information on peat extraction planning permissions.And Mr McNairney in his letter to planner said future work in the phasing out plans \"would greatly benefit from a better understanding of the location and scale of existing planning permissions for peat extraction\".Sarah Robinson, director of conservation with the Scottish Wildle Trust said: ldquoWe support the call to end peat extraction in the UK as one important step towards addressing the climate emergency and the bioersity crisis.ldquoThe majority of peat produced in Britain is taken from raised bogs in central Scotland for use in horticulture.\"Currently more than a dozen sites are being exploited in Scotland, many of which could still be restored to ing, wildle-rich bogsaction is taken quickly to begin to reverse the damage. We have already lost % of Scotlandrsquos raised bog habitats in the last  years. Protecting and restoring those that remain should be an urgent priority.ldquoAt the same time, we need to encourage both professional and amateur gardeners to use the peat-free products which are readily available. Ending extraction in the UK without tackling demand for peat-based compost will only lead to further damage to peatlands in other parts of Europe.Scottish Natural Heritage video highlighting some of themethods they have used to restore peatlands in Scotland.The CCC calling for major and urgent changes to how land is managed to help the UK reach its legal target to cut emissions to net zero by  said there should be a ban on \"damaging practices rotational burning on peatland and peat extraction\".And it suggests there should be an \"obligation\" for water companies and on landowners in areas of sites of special scientic interest to restore peatland on land they own.The CCC also suggests fth of agricultural land needs to be taken out of production and freed up for natural methods of storing carbon such as more woodlands and trees, the first in-depth report on land use from the committee urges.Encouraging people to cut the beef, lamb and dairy they eat by a fth - which the committee said was a \"modest\" reduction within Government health guidelines - will help cut greenhouse gases and free up land for storing carbon.Around , hectares or  million trees a year need to be planted from  up to mid-century, a signicant increase on todays levels of planting, which were around , hectares last year.A system similar to the subsidies which have boosted renewable energy in recent years, with auctions for contracts for planting and guaranteed long-term payments for land managers, could deliver the required increase.An alternative method would be a carbon trading scheme, and either policy could be paid for by greenhouse gas-emitting industries such as fossil fuel providers or airlines, the report suggests.Public money should also go to creating and managing woodlands, planting trees and boosting hedgerows which deliver other benefits such as flood prevention and wildle habitat.All the changes outlined in the report would cost around pound. billion a year in private and public funding up to , but would deliver pound billion in annual benefits, the committee said.Some % of the UKs total greenhouse gas emissions came from the way land is used in the country in , but with the right support for farmers and land managers, that could be cut by almost two thirds by , it said.The report is being published as land management policies are undergoing a huge shake-up as the UK quits the EU subsidy regime and, in England, shts towards payments for \"public goods\".Lord Deben, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, said: \"Changing the way we use our land is critical to delivering the UKs net zero target.\"The options we are proposing would see farmers and land managers - the stewards of the land - delivering actions to reduce emissions.\"Doing so can provide new revenue opportunities for farmers, better air quality and improved bioersity, and more green spaces for us all to enjoy.\"But he said the changes could not be delivered in the normal course of business, and warned: \"We are in a race against time, theres no doubt urgency must be the hallmark of what we are doing here.\"Achieving emissions reductions should not be at the expense of producing less food in the UK and increasing imports, the report said.Committee chief executive Chris Stark said British beef and lamb has some of the lowest rates of emissions in the world but greenhouse gases from livestock still needed to be cut.He said it was a question of eating \"a little less meat, but when you eat it, you should know you can go for high-quality produce in the UK and know it has lower greenhouse gas emissions than imports\".Measures to sht diets could include increasing plant-based options, better labelling and,needed, subsidies and taxes to encourage lower carbon eating, the report said.A Government spokesman said ministers would consider the reports recommendations closely, and added: \"Tackling climate change and the impact on our environment is both a national and international priority, and the UK is already leading the fight against it by delivering on our world-leading target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by .\"Thats why were reforming farming policy to reward environmental actions, reviewing our food system to ensure it is more sustainable, taking steps to accelerate tree-planting and peatland restoration, and introducing a

The rise follows similar increases in previous reports. Politicians celebrate, a new data point is plotted on a graph, workers keep on slogging and the country moves on, apparently more buoyant and prosperous than it was three months ago.But behind such figures is a truth that is becomingly increasingly hard to ignore: that the measures of old mean little in todayrsquos unequal, poverty-marred society where work no longer pays and jobs for le are few and far between. We might be going out to work of a morning, but it no longer follows that wersquore paid enough to live on, that our work is secure and dignied, or that wersquoll still be going to the same job next week, month or year. Rises in employment are little cause for celebrationthey donrsquot take account of the kind of employment they measure.Take, for example, the most recent ONS statistics on zero-hours contracts, which show , people in Britain employed with no guarantee of any work at all. These figures show an epidemic when compared to the , people on such contracts in . What they donrsquot show is the impact that such insecurity and precarity has on someonersquos le: shts cancelled with an hourrsquos notice no way to plan ahead financially in direct competition with colleagues for work, and little possibility of taking on a second job when yoursquore permanently at the whim of your first one. The top-line success of Britainrsquos employment figures includes these people.It also includes, when you dig deeper, a record increase in women working full-time, thought to be driving the overall growth. With feminists having long decried the low-paid, part-time work women find themselves locked in, and the undervaluing of domestic work and care, you might expect this to be welcome. But within the rise are the nearly four million so-called Waspi women affected by changes to the state pension age which mean they will have to work until  instead of . According to the campaign, many report struggling to continue in their previous jobs due to health issues ndash in many cases, caused by the dficult work theyrsquove undertaken for more than  years.And crammed into this figure alongside them is a fall in the number of working-age women out of work to care for children and relatives. Many of those young children and sick relatives havenrsquot gone anywhere instead, women across the country have chosen between this low or unpaid care work and a job that just about covers the costs of paying someone  to do it. Not to mention that analysis by the Fawcett Society suggests that many of these full-time employed women will effectively stop earning in mid-November thanks to the countryrsquos enduring pay gap.In Scotland, the rise appears to have been driven by men gaining work. But a similar increase has also occurred in the nationrsquos levels of in-work poverty, with  per cent of those in poverty also in employment, a figure that has continuously increased since . Low wages, insecure contracts and unscrupulous practices have conspired in Scotland just as where to create a situation where social security may be more lucrative than employment, and where the person who sells you ingredients for your dinner may well be reliant on a food bank for their own.Such blunt figures on employment clearly donrsquot tell us the whole, important, story about work in Scotland and the UK. But even by their own standards, they may not be entirely accurate. In October last year, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Developmentreleased research suggesting the UKrsquos real unemployment figure may be around three million higher, with ldquohidden unemployment ndash those who report themselves economically inactive for reasons such as health, caring or early retirement ndash re across the country. The OECDrsquos assessment serves to show how the cold, hard statistics to which we attach so much weight can easily become just as subjective as political spin.And while the uncomfortable reality of the UKrsquos employment landscape presents a compelling case for dropping our hero worship of black-and-white statistics, itrsquos only one example. Just as governments like that of Scotland and New Zealand have made the case for GDP being a blunt measure when it comes to quality of le, the oversimplied metrics we use to assess the likes of productivity, educational attainment and crime can preclude us from engaging with a range of dferent experiences and interpretations.We will always need data when done well and using the right metrics it can uncover, illuminate and emphasise a range of dferent aspects of our society. But we will also always need a critical eye with which to view it, and a genuine interest in the people and stories behind the numbers. Out of context, statistics are nothing more than pixels on a screen or ink on paper.If we were to devote the same energy to improving the landscape of work across the UK as we do to celebrating largely meaningless statistics, many of these problems could be addressed. But it would require stronger legislation on insecure contracts and poverty wages, and the creation of high-quality, long-term and unionised jobs. It would require restoring the power that has been ripped from the trade union movement and rebalancing the relationships between workers and bosses. And it would mean paying less attention to inaccurate and oversimplied numbers and more to the harsh realities we might be more comfortable ignoring."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-address-dim-sum","story":"THERE will be two good reasons to get merry and misty-eyed in Scotland tomorrow, with both Burns Night and Chinese New Year bumping into each other on the social calendar.

One time, it was because I caused a scene over a stolen jacket, but usually, it was because I was drunk and being a bit of an ****. One thing I can say, though, is that Irsquove never been thrown out of a nightclub because of my beliefs.But this is what appears to have happened at the Polo Lounge in Glasgow. The Polo is a LGBT venue in the centre of town, and according to a video on social media, a woman was kicked out of the club recently for wearing a T-shirt bearing the logo ldquoLGB Alliance. Some people are said to have complained the T-shirt was anti-trans and the woman was told to turn it inside-out or she would have to leave.The womanrsquos reaction to the situation was pretty much the reaction of everyone whorsquos ever been kicked out of a club: it wasnrsquot me. ldquoIrsquove just been removed, she said, ldquobecause trans people, who I didnrsquot even see, said I was threatening to them... Donrsquot I have the right to support lesbians, gays and bisexuals  Trans people, she went on, had the power to have her kicked out because they didnrsquot like an acronym on a T-shirt.:We must fight against the rolling back of trans rightsI realise the street outside a nightclub in the early hours of the morning is not the best place for nuance, but I wish we had more subtlety in this debate. My sympathy ndash instinctively and empirically ndash is with the nightclub I am a supporter of the right of trans people to identy their gender and to have all the rights of that gender. But I also dislike the idea of people who do not agree with a particular view being excluded from a public place.That said, I understand why many LGBT people dislike the LGB Alliance. Take their horrible website for a start. Therersquos nothing critics of trans reform seem to love more than pictures of trans women who do not ldquopass as women, which may explain why the LGB Alliance website is full of pictures of beautul, thin people and women who conform to traditional feminine images ndash they ldquolook like women in other words.Therersquos an unpleasant air of supremacy about the pictures and they make me deeply uncomfortable.Some of the language on the site is also worrying. I was speaking to Michael Cashman, the co-founder of Stonewall, the other day, and, although we didnrsquot talk about the Glasgow case specically, what he said on trans rights was interesting. Young peoplersquos attitudes to gender are in advance of older peoplersquos, he said, but he also believes some of the ways in which trans people have been portrayed are similar to the way gay men used to be portrayed ndash as a threat to children for example. ldquoDangerous to children is a phrase that appears on the LGB website, along with multiple uses of the word ldquothreat. We have been here before.The fact that some gay people have signed up to the LGB Alliance does not change its flaws.They do not explain, for instance, in what way the right to self-identication is a ldquomortal threat to gay rights. They also do not appear to acknowledge that legislating for equality involves a balancing of rights and risks. And they certainly do not explain on whose authority they seek to remove the T from LGBT. They do not have that right.: Scotland can learn lessons from Canada on trans best practiceIrsquom not saying their views are extreme ndash far from it, opposition to trans equality is not an unusual opinion, which is why we should take a nuanced view of the woman who was thrown out of Polo.What she was doing was insensitive and many people will have found her shirt offensive and unpleasant, but in Britain you are allowed to be insensitive, offensive and unpleasantyou want to be.My advice to the woman, had she asked me, would have been to get over herself and not to go to a gay bar wearing that shirt, because why would you want to upset people in a place where they feel safe But my advice to the club would have been to let her stay. Anyone who goes to a gay bar and claims therersquos no T in LGBT is being insensitive and provocative, but the gay bar can be better.It can say: we are a liberal, mature and progressive place we are tolerant and we tolerate even you."},{"url":null,"title":"1917-succession-hand-glasgow-economy-12-5m-boost","story":"Glasgow Film Officesaid big-budget Hollywood films including oscar-nominated  - co-written by Glasgow-born Krysty Wilson-Cairns - and award-winning tv dramas such as Succession - which features Scottish actor Brian Cox - setting up filming in the city ldquogenerated signicant economic activity.:Lets have letime bans for gobby cinema and theatre goersIt comes as Glasgow is set to take a starring role as Gotham City in the latest Batman adaptation starring Robert Pattinson.Council leader Susan Aitken said: ldquoThese latest figures point to the continuing attraction of Glasgow as a location for film production and, crucially, the successes of the councilrsquos Film Office in facilitating that.ldquoMajor productions like  and Succession not only generate signicant economy activity within the city but they profile what Glasgow has to offer to the film and broadcast industry, from our locations to our crews and facilities.:Glasgow screenwriter given Oscar nodShe added: ldquoThis approach has been so successful that I am sure we can look forward to hearing some super news about more major productions coming to Glasgow in the very near future."},{"url":null,"title":"euro-chiefs-sign-brexit-withdrawal-agreement-paving-way-britains-departure-eu-weeks-time","story":"Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen put their signatures to the document in Brussels after the Queen gave Royal Assent to the legislation implementing the agreement on Thursday.Following the formalities in the Belgian capital, the agreement was being taken to London by diplomatic bag for Boris Johnson to sign.

impressions show a widened high street bustling with le, outlining how the area could look in ten yearsrsquo time ndash albeit with an optimistic view of Scottish weather.Suggestions for the townrsquos revamp include repurposing the Paisley Centre shopping hub into a new residential quarter with ground-floor retail, as well as introducing a European-style food hall housing independent bars and eateries.Public spaces for outdoor activity could also be introduced, alongside lanes and streets creating new views and routes to lsquohiddenrsquo parts of the town centre.Meanwhile, vacant historic buildings such as the Liberal Club, YMCA building and TA Building could be brought back into use, and a high street cinema opened to attract visitors.Parts of university and college campuses could also be relocated into the heart of the town centre.SNP Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said the study ldquorepresents another signicant milestone in the regeneration of Paisley and is further evidence of the ambition and commitment of the local community and partners.She said: ldquoA huge opportunity now exists to use this collaborative vision to create more positive change in the town, as well as sharing learning which can benefit other town centres and communities across Scotland.The lsquoVision for Paisley Town Centre rsquo study is the result of a unique collaboration between Renfrewshire Council, the Scottish Government and Scotlandrsquos Town Partnership, and uses Paisley as a test case for a series of bold ideas which could also be implemented where.It aims to build on the momentum created by the townrsquos unsuccessful bid to become UK City of Culture .This includes a pound million investment in its venues and outdoor spaces, including turning Paisley Museum into a world-class destination.Renfrewshire Council leader Iain Nicolson said towns everywhere are struggling with the same issues around empty retail spaces.He said: ldquoWe canrsquot turn the clock back but we can consider how we could change to attract new le and footfall in future ndash and thatrsquos what Paisley is doing.ldquoItrsquos important to stress these are not concrete plans ndash they are a set of ideas designed to spark a conversation about what might be possible over the next decade.ldquoPaisley town centre is already changing for the better ndash the number of new cafes and restaurants and new housing built in recent years shows it is recognised as a good place to live and invest.ldquoCurrent and future council investment will make Paisley even more attractive to the private sector, but change of the scale imagined by the Vision could not be achieved by the council alone ndash so we want to hear from developers who could make that next stage of the journey happen.Phil Prentice, chief officer of Scotlandrsquos Towns Partnership, added: ldquoPaisley has a rich tapestry of heritage and culture, is steeped in industry and tradition, and has many major assets.ldquoWe hope this exciting blueprint can create a high street fit for st century citizens and Paisley can become an exemplar for other large towns across Scotland.Alan Anthony, managing director of Threesixty Architecture, who authored the new study, said it showed ldquoa people-first approach that reconnects the whole community to their town centre.He said: ldquoAs a lelong Paisley

Rationing also generated thousands of enquiries, and bureaux persuaded the government to grant extra clothes coupons to pregnant women. The first CABs in  were in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Stirling and Dundee.Post-war period: Against expectations, the end of the war brought an increased demand. CABs dealt with more enquiries than at the height of the blitz. Housing problems and family breakdowns increased. To meet this demand, the number of CABs began to prolerate.The advent of Legal Aid and the NHS led to a surge in enquiries.s: Housing problems continued to grow as people struggled with the housing shortage, overcrowding, and the end of rent controls.Hire purchase promised le on the ‘never-never.’ For many this led to mounting debts.s: Rents were rocketing, yet many people were still living in slum conditions and homelessness was rising. By  housing problems accounted for a quarter of the . million problems dealt with by CABs across the UK.Divorce reform too led to a surge in enquiries, with family problems representing  per cent of the CAB workload.s: Family, housing and benefit problems remained the top priority, but the consumer boom saw personal debt soar too. Industrial change saw an increase in redundancies and workers’ rights issues.s: Consumerism brought with it two recessions and debt and benefit cases doubled. Employment enquiries rose by  per cent. But debt, stemming from easy credit, became the biggest CAB issue.s: Social security became the top issue and sharp rises in VAT didn’t help.

In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Hands-on...Superintendent Sharon Comriehas worked for the SSPCA for an incredible  years.

I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

Currently, it supports communities in northern Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria. Mark said: “Our focus is enabling people to rebuild their livelihoods. We do that by offering skills training in everything from computer skills to bee keeping. That one struck me as odd but it turns out everyone loves honey!“Embrace the Middle East also supports intercommunal peace building. The charity is led by local partners and shows how changes, big and small, can make a dference.”While many Iraqi citizens have chosen not toto their homeland, Embrace is there to help those who do.Mark added: “Their homes and agricultural land have been damaged. Our focus is future-proofing their ability to stay in their communities.“We’re not an NGO which is there for a short-term fix – we are there for the long term.”As well as working for Embrace the Middle East three days a week, Mark is an honorary fellow at Aberdeen University and has also taught social sciences at Stirling and Durham Universities."},{"url":null,"title":"support for social enterprise","story":"Local social enterprise Wood RecyclAbility has received funding support from international firms in a bid to help their expansion plans.Wood RecyclAbility is looking to raise £, to expand and offer more opportunities for adults with learning disabilities.The social enterprise has been providingpractical work experience and training for people with additional support needs for  years and has prevented over , tons of waste wood from going to landfill.The social enterprise makes a range of products such as bird tables, planters and garden benches from the waste wood.The Ellon-based organisation has now received a £, funding boost from CNOOC International as they look to purchase equipment to ersy their work by recycling rigid plastic and mattresses.This comes after BP offered £, last month to support their work, along with a new contract secured with NHS Grampian to create  lockable boxes made from recycled wood.Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin welcomed the funding and said: “I know this money will make a real and tangible dference.”Operations manager Brian Reid said: “This is a fantastic start to our fundraising efforts, to enable us to recycle more rigid plastics and embark on mattress recycling.“As a social enterprise we really appreciate the generosity given to us both in terms of time and funding from CNOOC International.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

I was surrounded by a phenomenal group of kind and supportive people from all walks of le who had me laughing through every mental and physical challenge the wall had to give us.

I made the most amazing memories and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone , I will cherish every moment for the rest of my le and feel privileged to have been had this experience and to have raised funds and awareness for CLAN at the same time.”CLAN head of income generation and business development Fiona Fernie commented: “We are so grateful to everyone who undertakes challenges to raise money for CLAN.“We never underestimate how hard people work to raise money for CLAN and it is rewarding to hear when our supporters have had really positive experiences doing so. CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"ScotRail has launched a new campaign encouraging people to stop and think about their own personal safety while travelling or at work.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial. We must give a voice to our local producers in these trade talks while we still can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Residents will move from the old to the new care home over the weeks ahead.Rachael King, chair of Orkney Islands Council’s Orkney Health and Care committee, said: “Although St Peter’s has served the community well for many years, a new care home for Stromness has been an aspiration for local people.“Hamnavoe House has modern, state-of-the-art facilities and will provide residents with the highest standards of care in wonderful surroundings – with stunning views across the busy harbour to the town.“I think folk will be very impressed when they come along for the open day. All involved are looking to providing a warm welcome for residents and staff when they move to their new home.”Further details and pictures of the brand new facility will appear in The Orcadian on Thursday. vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There will be a particular interest in initiatives that link maths or computer science to real-world problems or inspire a erse range of students to engage with these subjects.Adam Lang, head of Nesta in Scotland, said: “Teachers across Scotland are doing an amazing job of inspiring our young people to engage with learning and we want to champion those taking innovative and creative approaches.“Young people today need to be prepared for a society and a world of work that is changing rapidly. Being able to think creatively and solve problems are essential skills that will help our young people to succeed now and in the future.“In an increasingly tech-driven society, maths, science and computing will be ever-more important, as will the ability to adapt and apply these disciplines creatively to the challenges we will face in the future.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Could he be right  Was she just imagining racism  But then he complained about the appearance of one Sikh soldier for four minutes in the World War One film .I don’t even want to mention his name but I’m going to have to. Sorry. Laurence Fox’s eruption as the love child of Katie Hopkins and Tim Nice But Dim has had a really profound effect on me. Of course I was yelling at the telly and firing off enraged tweets, but it was deeper than that. His outburst made me question everything I thought I knew about what kind of society we live in and myself.My confident public self was screaming rage at him with verve and enthusiasm. But my internal private chatter box was a frightened mess. For embedded deep within most people for colour who have managed to achieve even modest success is a deep sense of insecurity about our place, our station, and whether everyone is just madly bored of us bleating on about our struggles and feelings.When Fox nonchalantly told that woman on Question Time that she was “boring” and that she was playing the race-card, it was the most horrible confirmation that my inner persecuted minority voice was looking for.: Laurence Fox labels “wokeists” as “racist” following backlash over his Question Time appearance: Laurence Fox hits out at successful black and working class actors who criticise industryI heard my mother’s worried words when I was growing up warning me not to pursue a career in something which was not for “people like us” and to be a doctor . I was reminded of people who warned me against talking about my ethnicity when I first started doing stand-up, saying you don’t want to get pigeon-holed, stick with the knob gags for now . It’s taken us such a long time to not feel embarrassed to talk about issues of race and identity – yet now we have to stop because some actor has ennui  But is he right  Is Piers Morgan right  Are we seeing shadows where there are none  Are we imagining racism  I genuinely felt I was going mad for a while. But I guess that’s the definition of gaslighting.Toxic media bubbleOf course our feelings are not imagined. From the murder of Stephen Lawrence to the Windrush scandal to monkey chants at football matches to the only royal of colour being hounded out the country.The thing that upset me most was the fear that Fox and Morgan speak for the majority of the country. A silent majority who hate us. That freaks me out. I don’t know the answer to that question. My Twitter timeline is a fiesta of racist filth. But when I get out and about and meet people away from the increasingly toxic media bubble, like I did in Grantham yesterday, they restore my faith. I spoke to a group of head hunters who are trying to improve ersity in companies and organisations, not because they are all mad lefties but because it’s good for business and that’s what their clients want. They are even giving all their staff training on trying to overcome unconscious bias which we all have. Someone joked with me that Piers Morgan should try it but it could be like painting the Forth Bridge – a job you can never complete.One poor Sikh dudeI don’t want to believe everyone is racist. What a miserable way to live. I’m no bigot. Hey. Some of my best friends are privileged white men I used to make tea for and whose dry cleaning I used to collect. And I don’t want to be that person who screams “Nazi or Fash” at anyone who has a dferent opinion from me. And people on the left are as capable as being as idiotic and cruel as those on the right. The dference is that those people don’t actually have any real power or influence.But when we have reached a stage where to simply call out racism is now a sin or a crime by people who should know better, on mainstream media s, this country has gone backwards. And what a crying shame that is.I was really unnerved by that Question Time incident. Maybe he was tapping into something dark but undeniable  But mercully his stunning stupidity about the Sikh solider in the film  brought me to my senses. The way he banged on about it being institutionally racist made me go see the film as I genuinely thought it was going to be like an episode of Goodness Gracious Me. There was one poor Sikh dude. Who spoke one line and was on screen for about four minutes in a cast of white men. I almost wept with joy. I’m not going mad. The guy is not some social soothsayer. His breeding may be high but his knuckles scrape the floor. Phew.

We are about to find out just how seriously Brexit will affect the economy and le in general in the UK, something that will no doubt play a signicant part in the ongoing Scottish independence debate.For some, independence and the hope of ing to the European Union represent a sensible response to Brexit for others, it is simply a repeat of the same mistake, perhaps a worse one.Whatever the truth of these great, fundamental questions – based on emotion and competing senses of identity as much as anything  – it remains the case that any democratically elected government must still get on with what is sometimes called their “day job” – ensuring that hospitals, schools, the emergency services and so oneffectively.The clash between Nicola Sturgeon and interim Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw at First Minister’s Questions over police funding was a case in point.It came after complaints from a senior Scottish Police Federation official about leaking roofs in stations and the Scottish Police Authority’s vice-chair about a “structural deficit” in the policing budget.Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf then complained it was “unhelpful” to talk about police stations “falling apart”, describing the suggestion as “hyperbole”. A few hours later, the ceiling of a police station in Broughty Ferry collapsed. The timing may have been almost comic, but such issues are no laughing matter.The First Minister’s response was predictable – Carlaw had “a nerve” to even raise the issue, given the reduction in the Scottish Government’s budget from Westminster.That may serve as a political rejoinder in the heat of the moment, but it only has a degree of power when used against a Conservative politician. It would not work against the police officers on duty in Broughty Ferry. It is no answer to them at all.Similarly, pointing the finger of blame at Westminster over serious problems in the health services does nothing to address the concerns of over-worked medical staff or patients struggling to get an appointment or languishing on waiting lists.And it also is no comfort to anyonethe situation south of the Border is worse.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"reimagined princes street gardens would host 15 major events a year under new business plan","story":"A business plan for the long-awaited Quaich Project would see the redeveloped park used as a catalyst to ldquoreimagine Princes Street and the west end of the city in the next few years.There will be no limit on the number of ticketed events which do not restrict wider access to the gardens in future. The cap only affects concerts and other major events which close off all or part of the park to non ticket-holders during normal opening hours.The business plan, which is due to be discussed by councillors next week, would effectively give the green light for major events like the Summer Sessions pop and rock concerts, the Fly Open Air dance music festival, the cityrsquos festival fireworks finale and the Hogmanay concert in the gardens to continue.The proposed limit on events which restrict public access to the gardens is three times the size of a previous official cap, which has been in place for years. It was effectively relaxed when the council decided to treat an extended series of concerts as one event.The business case also raises the prospect of new medium-sized events being staged in the gardens, such as the ldquoSummer Nights events held in Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow. It is thought there would also be flexibility to accommodate large-scale one-off events involving the likes of the BBC, MTV or the Tour de France.The overall vision for the project, which has been in the planning for five years, is to \"create and sustain a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.\"Income from all-ticket events would help subsidise the staging of smaller-scale events in the gardens, such as a Pride event, cinema screenings, showcases for buskers, school prom events and light shows.Other new events could include theatre productions, traditional arts and culture events, live music performances, spoken word events and family activities. Under the vision for the future of the park, which dates back to the mid-th century, ldquoevery Edinburgh citizen and visitor to the city will have experienced West Princes Street Gardens and the Quaich Project. Community groups would only pay a nominal fee, which could be as low as £, for the use of the gardens for their events under the new financial model, with the city council handling bookings from event organisers and promoters.It is hoped up to £, a year could be generated from the hiring out of the gardens for events and income from the new two-storey ldquogateway centre, although running costs for the new-look gardens are estimated to come to up to £, in future.The Quaich Project, a public private partnership being pursued by the city council and a trust set up by Apex Hotels founder and former Edinburgh Playhouse owner Norman Springford, would see the run-down Ross Bandstand, which opened in , replaced by a ldquoHobbit House-style pavilion for performances and an amphitheatre instead of the existing concrete bowl.A two-storey complex featuring a visitor centre, cafe and corporate hospitality facilities would offer direct access from Princes Street and boast spectacular views of events below Edinburgh Castle. The business plan has been published ahead of detailed designs for the revamp of the park being submitted to the council in the spring. A key aim is to deliver ldquoa balanced programme of activities ranging from small scale community events  learning programmes to festivals and major events throughout the year, befitting a capital city, world class visitor destination and much-loved public lsquogarden.rsquoIt states: ldquoWe will curate the use of spaces and activities throughout West Princes Street Gardens to enable a primary focus on community events which reflect the nature of the spaces involved.\"These include school and family events, lectures and talks, garden and nature tours, traditional art and culture, live music and theatre, heritage and historical programmes. The new facility will be offered at low cost for community groups and schools.ldquoWe will also procure and programme a specic number of major events which will provide high profile and high-income streams to create the affordability to community groups.ldquoWe will promote and market the project to a wide range of community bodies, schools and colleges, event and festival organisers to ensure that a healthy balance exists to enable an active yet tranquil and accessible space across the year.It is hoped that the impact of the Quaich Project will help the west end of the city withstand the impact of the new St James development, which is due to open later this year. Work is also due to be finished within months on a new Johnnie Walker visitor centre in the former House of Fraser department store, while there are plans to turn the former Royal Overseas league building opposite the bandstand into a hotel.The blueprint states: ldquoSitting in the heart of Scotlandrsquos capital, the Quaich Project offers a unique  for promoting a wide iety of activity in a spectacular setting, underpinned by a core aim of providing a mix of events and activities that fulfil our mission.ldquoIt also offers a catalyst for the re-imagining of Princes Street and its environs. With the opening of the new St James Centre and the refocusing of retail activity to the eastern end of the city centre, the project has the potential to drive the context of the area ndash cultural, social, wellbeing and environmental themes dominating a space currently occupied by buses and shops.In his report for next weekrsquos culture committee, place director Paul Lawrence states: ldquoThe completion of the refurbishment and development of West Princes Street Gardens in general, and the redevelopment of the Ross Pavilion and the construction of the associated gateway building in particular, is to the benefit of residents, visitors, event organisers and festivals, and Edinburghrsquos reputation.Donald Wilson, the city councilrsquos culture chief, said: ldquoThis is a very important stage in the project to reimagine West Princes Street Gardens.ldquoThe core focus for the business model is on community access and activity by creating and sustaining a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.ldquoThis is a model where big events that involve exclusive access to the gardens are kept to a minimum, but these will make it possible to offer low cost rental of spaces to community or charitable organisations. Crucially, it proposes no more event days than we have at present.ldquoWest Princes Street Gardens are open almost every day of the year, with early closure for events, mainly in the evenings, amounting to less than % of normal opening times. It is estimated that within the new operating model this would continue.ldquoThe proposed new access route behind the pavilion is estimated to reduce event set up and takedown times by at least  per cent, thus reducing the impact on the gardens.David Ellis, managing director of the Quaich Project, said: ldquoOur vision is to improve the entirety of the gardens with a focus on making them a more enjoyable and accessible place for the benefit of Edinburgh residents and visitors all year round. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"raab uk would have acted differently after us refuses harry dunn suspect extradition","story":"The Foreign Secretary has said the \"UK would have acted dferently\" after the US secretary of state refused an extradition request for the suspect charged with causing the death of Harry Dunn.In a statement, Dominic Raab said the rejection \"amounts to a denial of justice\" and said the Foreign Office believes Anne Sacoolas shouldto the UK.The -year-olds parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn were informed of Mike Pompeos decision to refuse the request in a phone call with their constituency MP, Andrea Leadsom, on Thursday.: US diplomats we charged over Harry Dunns deathThe teenager died when his motorbike crashed into a car outside RAF Croughton in August last year.Mrs Sacoolas, , claimed diplomatic immunity following the crash and was able toto her home country, sparking an international controversy.DisappointmentIn a statement, Mr Raab said: \"I called the US ambassador earlier to express the Governments disappointment about this decision.\"We feel this amounts to a denial of justice, and we believe Anne Sacoolas shouldto the UK.

No film-maker has documented UK society as forensically as Ken Loach. The desperation that comes from poverty, the bad choices that often seem like the only choices available, are his stock-in-trade. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another compelling exemplar of what the man is all about.Marriedparents Ricky and Abbie did all the right things. They followed the rules andworked hard and were on the brink of becoming homeowners when the Northern Rockbuilding society collapsed, taking their dreams with it. Now mired in debt, theyare shunted from one shabby rental to another along with surly son Seb andsmart daughter Liza Jane.Ricky’sskills are no longer in demand. Even though he is a “grafter” who has doneevery job under the sun, proper jobs – with set hours, agreeable conditions, anda decent wage – are like hen’s teeth. So he takes a punt, persuades his we tosell her car, and buys a nearly-new van. them. He doesn’t get a wage – he chargesfees. He is a self-employed knight of the road, free to make as much money ashis speed around Newcastle will allow.Theillusion is soon shattered. His boss at the depot is a bullet-headed bruiserwith all the empathy of a shark. That’s because he himself is trapped in jungleof competition with other depots. He may be an apex predator, but he’s only asubstandard quarter away from losing his crown.Thegig economy is sold with promises of self-empowerment and personal agency thereality for Ricky is -hour days, a black box all-seeing eye that has timingsdown to the second, and financial penaltiesa sht is missed # for whateverreason, whether family emergency or personal injury.

When Abbie tells her that her own working day is from .am to pm,Rosie counters with: “What happened to the eight-hour day ”It is a pivotal scene.

This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks!

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I want to make sure the Assembly reflects the new opportunity we have and have said to members both publicly and privately that I have to try and set a standard here of respecting everybody no matter who is in that chamber, they are all equal. The people who vote for them are equal. It’s about respect at the end of the day and I have to earn that as well.”The West Belfast MLA said that his take on the dynamics of the new ing Assembly going forward is that “it’s very important that it rises to occasion”. Having met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnston, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Maskey said that both governments need to “respect that as well”. “We’ve got to respect political dference and we have to manage those,” he said. “I had very constructive engagements with them on Monday, obviously the substance of their visits was dealt with by the Executive.”Impartiality in his role as Speaker is a core element of the post, he said.“I had been pushing very hard on securing the funding that was announcement by the Department for Education for West Belfast schools. When it was announced about St John the Baptist I couldn’t even comment on it as I was in the ‘chair’ and that is the type of thing that your constituency needs to see a result on. There are little restrictions in this role but I will try to manage them."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"andytown ahead of schedule","story":"THE new Andersonstown Leisure Centre is set to open to the public in April, it has been revealed.Speaking at the official opening of the Brook Leisure Centre in Twinbrook, Cllr Brian Kingston, Chair of Belfast City Council’s Strategic, Policy and Resources Committee, said the redevelopment project was “ahead of schedule”.He said: “West Belfast has more to look forward to later this year with the opening of the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, scheduled to open in April.“Herron Brotherstold me they are ahead of schedule.“Both Brook and Andersonstown Leisure Centres will completely transform leisure opportunities and active living access in West Belfast.”The new £ million state-of-the-art facility on the Andersonstown Road will focus largely on water-based family fun, with the newly installed water slides having been visible for months.The centre will also offer a range of dry facilities including a -station fitness suite, exercise and spin studio, café, multi-purpose room and two outdoor G five-a-side pitches."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"best of traditional irish music for belfast","story":"THE Waterfront Hall is set to host the  Gradam Ceoil TG music awards, with globally renowned quintet Beoga playing live at the internationally acclaimed event.Trad sensation Beoga, who collaborated with Ed Sheeran for his  chart topping hit ‘Galway Girl’ will take to the stage, for what is set to be the biggest Gradam Ceoil to date.Gradam Ceoil is the premier annual traditional music awards, with this year’s event set to be televised live on TG and available to stream on BBC iPlayer live from Belfast on Sunday February  thanks to support from Northern Ireland Screen’s Irish Language Broadcast Fund.The band are looking forward to their upcoming performance in Belfast.“We are delighted to be involved in the rdannual Gradam Ceoil TG traditional music awards celebration.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

This obligation of discovery has not been attended to properly by the police.”He acknowledged security forces’ concerns, saying: “They may well feel that they don’t wish to have paramilitary organisations gaining access to material that would explain the way they go about their business.”In , a report by the Historical Enquiries Teamraised collusion concerns around the involvement of an alleged RUC Special Branch agent.It found that now-dead UVF commander and suspected police mole Robin “the Jackal” Jackson had been connected to one of the murder weapons by fingerprint analysis, the lawyer told the court.Mr Sayers said: “It is clear that the issue of subversion within the UDR was debated at a high level.”He said issues with how Jackson was dealt with by police on discovery of the pistol caused concern to the HET in .Mr Sayers added: “It is notable that they said that the HET accepts from the outset that collusion is established by the involvement of UDR people and access to UDR equipment.“I ask you to order that the bundle of Public Interest Immunitymaterial be disclosed to the plaintf with the appropriate redactions.”Kevin Rooney QC, for the security forces, has recently been assigned to the matter.He said: “There was a huge amount of work involved in providing discovery. The documentation is voluminous.”He added that the outstanding documents were almost ready: “The police can have that done by the end of next week, perhaps sooner than that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"limited testing taking place after faults found in mot car lifts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its about hard work and dedication,\" he said of its joint ninth place.Principal of Castlederg High School Elaine McKelvey said she was \"delighted\" it was the highest-ranking non-grammar school in the league table.\"These results are testimony to the excellent provision for learning made at Castlederg High School by a highly dedicated staff, working in partnership with very supportive parents to ensure the best possible outcome for each young person,\" she said.Mrs McKelvey paid tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff during \"a most challenging period for educational delivery within all schools in Northern Ireland, given the shortfall in capital funding and inequitable remuneration for teaching staff\".\"Most of all though, we are tremendously proud of our pupils and their achievements, noting the breadth of opportunity for the future that such excellent exam results have created for them,\" she added.The Department of Education said the information contained in the league table relating to GCSE results \"does not provide a valid basis for comparing performance between schools, since it takes no account of intakes of the schools or of any other factors that may affect pupil performance\".It added: \"No single measurement can constitute a fair or accurate evaluation of a school, and the figures should be considered in the context of other information about schools and their pupils.\""},{"url":null,"title":"charles lays flowers on tomb of grandmother princess alice in jerusalem","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I am sure it was the same standard that was lying on her coffin in St George’s Chapel”.“I asked His Royal Highnesshe could possibly send a new one, and he did, within a year or so. It looks lovely.“He has the old one which we sent to him. He hung it up in his house over his staircase. He said he has both standards of both grandmothers now there, next to each other.“He comes here and he can say a prayer. He knew Princess Alice very well.”After the prayer, Charles had a few moments alone in the vault with James Jones, a retired Bishop of Liverpool and a friend of the prince.Fr Krassovsky said: “For a small period of time they closed the doors, they were there alone. It is something special. It is something that is very personal.“He also has a very strong interest in the Orthodox church, so all this together is quite a special thing for him.” "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/a469a/38891653.ece/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Scotland-protestors-2.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon heckled over snps ira links in scottish parliament","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We had to go to Pennyburn. googletag.cmd.push  Derek McCauley, founder member of Shantallow Community Centre. Photo - Deirdre Heaney, nwpresspics  The move was a big culture shock.I saw a very urgent need to get an organisation together to improve the situation.I felt what was needed was a tenants association.The seeds of the Shantallow Tenants Association were sown when the residents began organising bus runs to Moville and Malin.It was a great opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other and there was a general consensus that more should be done for the young families in the area.In , just before the outbreak of the Troubles, Mr McCauley wrote  to the Belfastasking for help as he knew there were a lot of tenants associations in the Greater Belfast area.Groups from across the North advised him how to go about setting up a tenants association.The Highfield Tenants, Association, Amalgamated Corporation Tenants Asso- ciation, Tullycarnet Tenants Association, Lyne Social Club in Larne, North Belfast Tenants Association and the National Federation of Tenants Associations all wrote to me.I received lots of replies and they supplied me very useful advice.Most of these associations were political and non sectarian and I still have those letters.The main theme of these letters was use your politicians, but dont let them use you.The first meeting was held in a small gun club in the area by founder members, Danny Cooley, Tom Doherty, Sally Fleming and Mr McCauley.Mr McCauley was elected as chairman and Mr Cooley was elected as treasurer and it quickly became clear a community centre was needed.We put a questionnaire around the estate asking would they like a centre and what they would like to see in it and we got a great response.The association met with the Housing Trust  and made their case.We met with a lady called Miss MCCullough. She was a great help to us and I think we struck a chord with her, said Mr McCauley.The reason we were successful was because we were non political and non sectarian.When we went to ask for anything we asked politely and we didnt demand it.The Shantallow Community Centre was the first of its type to be built in the city and cost pound,.Its was only supposed to last  years, said Mr McCauley.The centre was soon a hive of activity and people came from across the city to use it.We had a childrens play group, handicraft classes, Irish dancing classes, piano lessons, a childrens disco and a youth disco on a Saturday night.It was the only disco of its kind in the city at that time we had young people coming from Newbuildings and the foot of Bishop Street for that.You would find them standing outside after and they had no way of getting home, so I would have given them a lt in my big yellow Zephyr.Everyone remembers the Zephyr. If I go to a wake in Shantallow people say to me do you still have that big yellow car The list of activities at the centre continued to grow with gymnastics, rollerskating, indoor bowls and bingo.In  they held a cross community festival for all the churches in the area.It was a good time, said Mr McCauley.It was all young families living in the area and on the summer days you would have thought there was a swarm of bees out on the back square but it would just have been all the children.That was before phones and Playstations.The work of the centre stretched far outside its doors with bus runs, dinner dances, outdoor festivals, sports competitions and luncheon clubs.Mr McCauley dedicated countless hours to it, but he said none of it would have been possible without the support of his we, Rita, who sadly passed away two years ago.She was the most important person, he said.We had six children and she had to rear them all.Mr McCauley eventually retired from the Tenants Association in , but not before he shared his knowledge with community groups across the city. A long list of people gave many volunteer hours to the Shantallow Tenants Association and Community Centre.I would like to wish all future communities the success we had and give a special thanks to all those people who made it so successful. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We had to go to Pennyburn. googletag.cmd.push  Derek McCauley, founder member of Shantallow Community Centre. Photo - Deirdre Heaney, nwpresspics  The move was a big culture shock.I saw a very urgent need to get an organisation together to improve the situation.I felt what was needed was a tenants association.The seeds of the Shantallow Tenants Association were sown when the residents began organising bus runs to Moville and Malin.It was a great opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other and there was a general consensus that more should be done for the young families in the area.In , just before the outbreak of the Troubles, Mr McCauley wrote  to the Belfastasking for help as he knew there were a lot of tenants associations in the Greater Belfast area.Groups from across the North advised him how to go about setting up a tenants association.The Highfield Tenants, Association, Amalgamated Corporation Tenants Asso- ciation, Tullycarnet Tenants Association, Lyne Social Club in Larne, North Belfast Tenants Association and the National Federation of Tenants Associations all wrote to me.I received lots of replies and they supplied me very useful advice.Most of these associations were political and non sectarian and I still have those letters.The main theme of these letters was use your politicians, but dont let them use you.The first meeting was held in a small gun club in the area by founder members, Danny Cooley, Tom Doherty, Sally Fleming and Mr McCauley.Mr McCauley was elected as chairman and Mr Cooley was elected as treasurer and it quickly became clear a community centre was needed.We put a questionnaire around the estate asking would they like a centre and what they would like to see in it and we got a great response.The association met with the Housing Trust  and made their case.We met with a lady called Miss MCCullough. She was a great help to us and I think we struck a chord with her, said Mr McCauley.The reason we were successful was because we were non political and non sectarian.When we went to ask for anything we asked politely and we didnt demand it.The Shantallow Community Centre was the first of its type to be built in the city and cost pound,.Its was only supposed to last  years, said Mr McCauley.The centre was soon a hive of activity and people came from across the city to use it.We had a childrens play group, handicraft classes, Irish dancing classes, piano lessons, a childrens disco and a youth disco on a Saturday night.It was the only disco of its kind in the city at that time we had young people coming from Newbuildings and the foot of Bishop Street for that.You would find them standing outside after and they had no way of getting home, so I would have given them a lt in my big yellow Zephyr.Everyone remembers the Zephyr. If I go to a wake in Shantallow people say to me do you still have that big yellow car The list of activities at the centre continued to grow with gymnastics, rollerskating, indoor bowls and bingo.In  they held a cross community festival for all the churches in the area.It was a good time, said Mr McCauley.It was all young families living in the area and on the summer days you would have thought there was a swarm of bees out on the back square but it would just have been all the children.That was before phones and Playstations.The work of the centre stretched far outside its doors with bus runs, dinner dances, outdoor festivals, sports competitions and luncheon clubs.Mr McCauley dedicated countless hours to it, but he said none of it would have been possible without the support of his we, Rita, who sadly passed away two years ago.She was the most important person, he said.We had six children and she had to rear them all.Mr McCauley eventually retired from the Tenants Association in , but not before he shared his knowledge with community groups across the city. A long list of people gave many volunteer hours to the Shantallow Tenants Association and Community Centre.I would like to wish all future communities the success we had and give a special thanks to all those people who made it so successful. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar. St Finbarrs registration for the  season takes place in Meadowbank on Tuesday, January  and Tuesday, February  at ..

His support has been an immense source of personal pride. I hope that I’ve done him proud in .“Seamus lived for Ireland and worked for all of its people - we are all the better for it.“The pride of Seamus’ le was his dearly loved late we Gertrude, their daughter Orla and granddaughter Lara.My thoughts and prayers are with Orla, her husband Mark, and Lara at this dficult time.

Lyndon Stephens died that morning after battling stoically against illness. His record label, Quiet Arch, was already planning to go into hiatus due to his illness and had planned a farewell gig in the Belfast Empire for that very evening. As fate would have it, it became his wake. I am a firm believer in the human spirit being how people remember you and I prefer to gather other people’s memories for things like this. Ryan Vail: “The man that gave me a career in music, toured me around the world, put me on tv, put me on radio, made me a headline festival artist, got me sound tracking, got me remixing, got me producing, got me talking on some of the most important industry , got me the most prestigious funding awards my manager, friend, label partnerLyndon Stephens.“I was his very first signing nine years ago and stayed with him the whole time. We released together, toured together started labels together, found acts together and had hours of phone calls together daily. “To be honest it’s been so so dficult to comprehend. Im really grateful for the memories we shared together.“RIP Lyndon, thank you for changing my le”Ciaran Lavery: “I first met Lyndon Stephens at Output, Belfast. He didn’t know me or owe me anything but kept putting me forward to talk to the local press that were at the event. “After the show, he askedI’d like to chat to him about working together. “Over the course of the next five years we broke down so many walls and glass ceilings. We spoke on the phone three for four times a day every day. I could call him at ungodly hours and he always answered, he was always there, Lyndon loved to talk. He was an incredible human being with a wonderful family and friends circle. “I know that when any friend musician needed advice of funding I pointed them towards Lyndon andhe had the time, he gave it willingly. I have an incredible amount of memories. I will miss my old friend so dearly, but in truth, I am truly blessed to have met Lyndon Stephens”.Francesca O’Connor, from Quiet Arch ,said “Lyndon Stephens, a man who wanted to make a genuine dference to this world, give the underdogs a  to shine and to show the world the incredible talent coming out of Northern Ireland. “He set up an artist management company, Champion Sound Music and record label, Quiet Arch, to put Northern Ireland artists on the international stage. I will forever be grateful to him for hiring me as a trainee artist manager . years ago. “As a young female with little experience but an eagerness to learn, he gave me a chance. I can only take inspiration from his creativity, decisiveness, determination and unwavering passion to succeed to carry on what he started. “Not long ago, he sent me the poem Go All The Way by Charles Bukowski and I cant think of a better way to describe his tenacious spirit.” She concluded: A loving husband, father, sister and friend, Lyndon is undoubtedly one in a million and will never be forgotten”.Ben Magee, also of Quiet Arch said “Lyndon’s biggest strength, and of those he had many, was when he believed in you, you knew about it. He was never one to shower you with praise, butyou had Lyndon in your corner, he made you feel like you could conquer the world. “A profound, hilarious inidual who was always one step ahead of everyone  in the room, Lyndon never spent a second of his le saying goodbye. “He always had his eyes fixed squarely on the horizon, eyebrows raised, a mad cackle dancing on the corner of his mouth. He was a mentor, a confidant, an always open ear and a friend. And I will miss him dearly.”My memories of Lyndon are very similar to Ciaran’s and probably most other people’s. he was always willing to help and preferred to talk over the other means of communication. If I ever went off the deep end with one of my rants at the music scene here Lyndon would message me quickly to calmly explain how things worked and how I might be right but mostly how I was wrong. It always began with a text message but was always swtly abandoned in favour of a chat. Always knowledgeable and always reasonable I will truly miss the advice and am forever grateful for the counsel. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But with our lives being so busy we often forget the simple activities bring the happiest times and memories. As parents, and childminders too, we can also feel under pressure to always be teaching our children, so this week I’ve combined these two themes, baking and learning. The curriculum for our young children talks about three prime areas of learningand these are Personal, Social andEmotional Development - this is all about learning to share, to wait, taking an interest and participating in activities, being responsible for tasks, having opportunity to feel valued and able to contribute, talking about what you are doing together, asking questions and having a special bond etc. googletag.cmd.push Communication and Language - this is about listening, paying attention, being able to focus and concentrate, being able to follow instructions, naming dferent items and actions, speaking in sentences, asking and answering questions, having a two way conversation etc Physical Development - is about small finger movements and large movements too, it’s about being able to use and control items, objects and tools etc and also self care, personal hygiene, having own likes and dislikes, being safe and using equipment safely etc. If we consider these and look at all that baking involves we can see all the learning that is going on from collecting all ingredients, selecting and organising bowls, spoons, whisks etc, washing hands, putting on an apron, then reading instructions, following a receipe, talking about what next, weighing, counting, pouring, breaking, mixing, adding, stirring, smelling, washing implements, waiting for cakes to cook then cool before sharing and tasting! googletag.cmd.push  Recipes For You To Make Together Scones - g oz self raising flour, g oz butter, g oz caster sugar, ml fl oz milk, pinch of salt . Method Heat the oven to C F Gas . Lightly grease a baking sheet. Mix together the flour and salt and rub in the butter. Stir in the sugar and then the milk to make a dough. Put onto a lightly floured work topand knead. Roll out the dough to about cm thick and shape into scones. Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk. Bake for - minutes until well risen and golden. Then leave to cool on a wire rack and add whatever you like! If you want to add sultanas or choc chips before you bake then why not! Cheese Pancakes -   cup flour,  frac tsp baking powder,  frac tsp sugar,   tsp salt,  egg,  cupof grated cheddar cheese - too much cheese will make them too sloppy,  cup milk ,  tbsp melted butter. Method Mix together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Stir the grated cheddar cheese into the flour mixture until everything is evenly combined. Beat together in a separate bowl the egg, milk and melted butter. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just to moisten. Heat a lightly oiled frying pan over medium high heat. Spoon the batter onto the pan, using approximately   cup for each pancake. Cook till brown on both sides and enjoy! Cupcakes - g butter , it’s a good idea to get the butter out of the fridge much earlier so it is soft!,  large eggs, g caster sugar,g self raising flour . Method heat oven to C   F  Gas . Fill a cup cake tray with  cake cases. Whisk together butter, sugar then add beaten eggs bit at a time, whisking in between. Add vanilla extract and sieved flour then pop the mixture into the cake cases and into the oven for about  minutes. If you’d like to decorate with buttercream after they have cooled , then to make the butter cream mix together g butterand g icing sugarthen add  tbsp milk and food colouringyou like. You can use a spoon or fork to add the buttercream to the cupcakes or even use a piping bag! Biscuits… - p vanilla extract. Method Heat oven to C C F Gas  and line a baking tray with baking   greaseproof paper. Put the butter in a bowl and beat until soft and creamy. Beat in the sugar, then the egg and vanilla, and then the sieved flour to make a dough - knead. If the dough feels sticky, add a little bit more flour. Roll out to about   cm thickness and cut out shapes using a biscuit cutter or rim of a cup. If you feel adventurous then gently press some clean toys into the biscuit - car tracks, lego shapes etcor add sultanas to make a face! Then bake for - minutes before eating!

They often neglect to inform the applicant until the application has been in the system for weeks, causing unnecessary delays and obviously frustration.”“It stands to reason thatwe had a passport office in the north, which would be more accessible to residents from Donegal to Antrim, issues would be easier to resolve.”“In the meantime, our office in South Derry has a supply of blank passport forms and we are happy to sign them for everyone.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s just not about buying equipment and supplying resources, said Mr McLaughlin.Don’t get me wrong, the doctors are amazing in the unit and le savers, but as parents you just don’t bond with them the way you do with the nurses.They are there  hours a daycaring for the babies.The McLaughlins endured a dficult time after the birth of their daughters, with two premature babies to care for.The Twin to Twin Syndrome meant the girls had received an uneven blood supply in the womb and because they were also born early they needed help to feed and breathe.The couple spent many anxious hours by their daughters incubators and during that time they saw first hand the work of the nurses in the unit.Good news or bad news, the nurses are there to celebrate with you or to pick up the pieces, said Mr McLaughlin.They prepared us mentally for everything coming and saw us through it.Many times we saw nurses miss lunch breaks and dinner breaks because the unit was stretched.We saw them missing their children’s or husbands birthdays because the unit was understaffed.One thing about those nurses, their patients always came first.Mr McLaughlin said he fully supported the recent strike action undertaken by nurses and health service staff for pay parity and safer staffing levels.Spending nearly two months with them we saw that they have financial commitments and dfi- culties like everyone . It was very upsetting for us to learn they were being treated dferently from their colleagues in England, Scotland and Wales.If the person who makes these decisions walked in the footsteps of our neonatal nurses for a week, they might think dferently.Just before Christmas, Saorlaith and Soairse deliveredpound, of Foyleside Shopping Centre vouchers to the nurses, which was raised through a raffle and quiz night.This year we organised a stand alone event for our NICU nurses simply because they deserve it and we wanted to let them know how much the public think of them,”said Mr McLaughlin.We have received Facebook messages and thank you cards from nurses we have never met so it just showed us how much it meant to them.The night we left over their Foyleside vouchers the strike was a hot topic and it was the perfect time to reassure the nurses they had massive support in our community and that we understood why they were doing it. It was just nice that the community were there for the nurses when they needed a bit of help and support with the strikes and I know they were over the moon with the Foyleside vouchers.In Saorlaith and Saoirses eyes it was mission accomplished.Earlier this month, the twins delivered the latest cheque forpound,. to the NICU.A spokesperson for Western Health and Social Care Trust said: This is the fourth donation the McLaughlin family have made toNICUas a show of appreciation for the great care Saorlaith and Saoirse received during their time there in .The family has raised a total of pound, for the Unit.Staff in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit are overwhelmed by the incredible generosity of the McLaughlin family, the local community and businesses who have been fundraising to support our premature babies and their families who we care for in the Unit.Thank you to everyone who has donated it is very much appreciated. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development.

Pat Havern, Corey Quinn and Donal OrsquoHare did most of the scoring that day, but Tipperary will be a dferent proposition at the weekend.New Tipp manager David Power, who famously led the county minors to an All-Ireland title in , has an abundance of talent at his disposal, but he will have to without star player Michael Quinlivan.The Clonmel Commercials man has decided to go travelling for a year and his absence is a huge loss to Tipperaryrsquos attack and the countyrsquos bid to regain their status in the top flight ahead of next seasonrsquos championship changes.Promotion is also a must for Down as well, as they too have huge aspirations of avoiding competing in the All-Ireland second tier competition.Down have just emerged from an indferent McKenna Cup campaign.Wins over Fermanagh and Antrim were cast aside when Tallyrsquos team were given a reality check by Tyrone in the semi-finals.Mickey Hartersquos experimental side simply over-powered Down and had too much physicality all over the park.Hopefully, Down will have learned from that game, but second guessing Tallyrsquos team selection ahead of Sunday is a dficult job.Definitely missing Sundayrsquos game will be vice-captain Caolan Mooney, the one player in the camp who has the ability to stand out from the rest. His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night.

planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a so-called bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020

The tourism season in Newcastle is now all-year long and we want to keep the car-park open.Cllr Devlin said that the council was ldquoa victim of its own success in being able to attract the numbers of visitors to the town.She questioned the proposalrsquos contention that Newcastlersquos parking demand ldquosignicantly decreases during the winter months.ldquoIt used to be that we would have parking problems during particular times such as the Festival of Flight and bank holidays. But now as long as its dry, Newcastle is busy and parking is a necessary part of the town centre, she said.ldquoWhen the overflow car park is not being used, itrsquos complete chaos and parking can create issues for residents in nearby folds.She asked council officers when the new overflow car-park would be open for business andthe current overflow area could be kept open in the interim to help with parking demand.Michael Lipsett, the councilrsquos director of active and healthy communities, said he envisaged the work lasting three months and promised that once the necessary planning approval was gained, his department would be preparing to tender for a contractor as soon as possible.Slieve Croob Cllr Andrew McMurray queried whether the car-park would be a ldquoblanket tarmac covering andit would encroach on the green space.He was told that the proposal was to use a synthetic grid which would allow grass to show through so it would look green but would also indicate the car spaces available and one-way traffic system planned.Mournes Cllr Harold McKee welcomed the development as a ldquogreat idea and said parking in Newcastle was ldquoan absolute nightmare at any time of the year.Cllr Devlin suggested that the current overflow parking area should be in continuous use until the new facility is opened.However, Mr Lipsett said he currently did not have the budget available to cover this but would investigate and report back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Philip.jpg","title":"Philip and Helen in tandem at Kildare  ","story":"ON a bitterly cold Saturday morning Phillip and Helen Vint were at the start line for the latest in the East of Ireland Marathon series, at Staplestown, in North Kildare, which also provides half marathon and k alternatives, mostly for partners, like Helen who feel itrsquos nice to be there to support your other half, but who feel that running a marathon with them is pushing things a bit too far, . miles too far to be exact.The temperature was -C when they began running and a sultry +C when they finished and underfoot conditions were slippery by virtue of the frozen ice around the route.So, well done to both on completing what they describe as steady runs for their firsts of , Phillip in .. and fth place and Helen in .. and third place respectively.BornRunSaturday saw a big turnout,  in fact, for the sixth of the BornRun Run Forest Run Series.This week the venue was Gosford Country Park which will also host the NI  Ulster Intermediate and Masters Cross Country Championships next weekend.The only distance on offer this week was k and the route headed out in a loop around the start and continued towards the outer boundaries of the forest.The first k was quite level and took everyone into the scenic forest for k where there were a few small inclines, but overall it was a flat, fast course with a good run in the last k down to the finish line.No-one made better use of the terrain than East Downrsquos Jimmy Sloan, who fairly flew round the course in a superb ., which was almost two minutesahead of the second-placed Thomas Carson . with third place filled by Barry McAuley in ..I believe this is Jimmyrsquos first win in club colours and it certainly wonrsquot be his last, given his present form and continuing improvement, which in spite of hearing later that the distance was allegedly  metres short, nevertheless represents a great effort and time.

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year. Thanks should also go to the local businesses who supported and Irsquod like to encourage residents to visit their local business to support Small Business Saturday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves. The vast majority just wonrsquot be able to do this.ldquoIntroducing policy which isnrsquot fit for purpose could have severe consequences. The impact on consumers must be central to discussions on the future of heating, and cost and disruption minimisedsupport for climate change action is to be forthcoming.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in.
