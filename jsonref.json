That was not cool at all.’However Netta has previously explained the reasons behind her look and love of Japanese culture – saying she adopted it as a defence mechanism after being bullied at school.Speaking to  in Lisbon ahead of the contest, she explained it ‘took time to find her niche’ after the way she was treated by her peers when she was younger, and that music also helped her overcome difficulties.It’s common knowledge that the star is a huge fan of the Japanese culture, especially the children’s TV series Pokemon, as she previously claimed her favourite Pokemon was Bulbasaur .Talking to the Independent she answered of her favourite: ‘Bulbasaur because he’s sassy and he’s a good friend and his vines would help me reach whatever I want.’Before adding: ‘Also, Jigglypuff as he can sing and that could help me to sleep, as I’m having trouble sleeping because I’m over excited about everything that’s happening.‘Also he paints on peoples faces when they’re asleep which I’ve done too. Finally… Snorlax. He’s fat and amazing.’While there were those who weren’t keen on her outfit, others picked up on her love for the Japanese culture, and showed their support for the star.Someone wrote: ‘Its not cultural appropriation as long as it is done with admiration of the culture. Netta has said that she chose this theme because it is something that she really loves a lot and she wants to promote it. Context matters!’And another user added: ‘I saw Netta’s performance and the cultural appropriation tweets did not disappoint. But appropriation is when a dominant culture adopts traits of a minority culture. I really don’t consider Israeli culture dominant over Japanese or vice versa.’ have reached out to Netta’s reps for comment. If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the  Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you.MORE: Salvador Sobral hands Netta the 2018 Eurovision trophy after calling Israel’s winning song Toy ‘horrible’MORE: SuRie still has sense of humour as she breaks silence following Eurovision stage crasher ruins performance"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_11988569.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"man ski mask threw acid womans face dated black man","story":"Alma Ponce, 18, was left with burns on her face, neck, arms and chest when she was attacked (Picture: SWNS)A woman has been left scarred for life after a mystery thug wearing a ski mask doused her in acid.Alma Ponce, 18, was attacked with the corrosive liquid during a midnight ambush outside her home on June 18 last year.TV reporter is surprised to suddenly find herself on televisionThe attacker unscrewed a lightbulb on her porch and waited in darkness until she returned from work with her mother Patricia Ponce and brother Luis Ruiz, eight.As Patricia, 45, tried to unlock the front door the attacker raced around the side of the house and hurled acid at Alma before fleeing the scene.Police believe it was a racially motivated attack after her mother found graffiti daubed on the side of the family home which read: ‘Alma n***r loving wh*re.’Alma Ponce, 18, before the attack (Picture: SWNS)Alma, of Oak Cliff in Dallas, Texas, said: ‘I think about this attack every day and it will be something I think about for the rest of my life.‘I wake up every morning and I just hope it was a dream but it never is because then I see my scars in the mirror.‘At night I get scared. I think the could be around that corner waiting for me again.’The sales rep was rushed to hospital with second degree burns on her face, neck and chest, and had to undergo a series of skin grafts.Alma feared for her life when her attacker threw burning acid all over her (Picture: SWNS)Alma said: ‘I just didn’t know what to do, it was just seconds but it felt like a long time. All I could feel instantly was this burning sensation on my neck and face. It was awful.‘It got into my eye so I couldn’t see. It felt like my skin was melting off. I ran down the porch to my little brother’s kiddy pool and I just threw myself in.I really thought I was done, I thought I was going to die. The pain was so bad.’The slur led Dallas Police to believe the attack was racially motivated because Alma had previously dated an African-American.Alma believes the attacker will never be caught (Picture: SWNS)‘We weren’t together at the time. The police never found out who did it,’ she added.Alma now lives in fear the attacker – who has not been caught – will strike again. I’m really not hopeful that they’ll ever catch who did this,’ she said.‘I was unable to tell the police anything about him and it all happened so quickly. At first I was so angry and upset but I realized my anger was pointless.‘Right now I’m just focusing on moving on with my life.’MORE: Tube map reveals cheapest places for commuters to live in LondonMORE: PC who groped women at Christmas party barred for life from the police"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/958035968.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"mohamed salah sets new premier league goal record eclipsing shearer ronaldo suarez","story":"Mohamed Salah scored his record breaking goal against Brighton in front of the KopMohamed Salah has set a new record for most goals goals scored in a single Premier League campaign thanks to his 26th-minute goal against Brighton on Sunday.The Egyptian has been in incredible form this season, scoring 42 goals in all competitions, and has now notched his 32nd goal of the Premier League campaign to break the record for a 38-game season.Alan Shearer (1995-96), Luis Suarez (2013-14) and Cristiano Ronaldo (2007-08) had all shared the record with Salah, but now he has claimed it outright.Salah is the only player to win three Player of the Month awards in a single season (Getty)But not content with being the greatest goalscorer of the modern Premier League era, Salah has made no secret of his desire to break the record for a 42-game season too.Shearer (1994-95) and Andy Cole (1993-94) both netted an astonishing 34 times with Blackburn and Newcastle respectively.Salah has scored, on average, a goal every 91 minutes in the Premier League this season, as well as registering nine assists.Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) – 32 goalsSpeaking about his pursuit of both this season’s golden boot and the all-time scoring record, Salah told Sky Sports: ‘Honestly as you can see, I have had a great season and still some games to go.‘For anyone the most important thing is to play good, to perform good, to score goals for your team.

I will not let you down.’Mrs May stressed the UK would be aligned with Brussels on some issues as there had to be ‘compromises’ after withdrawal.‘Of course, the details are incredibly complex, and, as in any negotiation, there will have to be compromises.’Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer branded Cabinet isions over proposals for a customs arrangement farcical.He told the BBC: ‘I think we are in a farcical situation at the moment, nearly two years after the referendum the Cabinet is fighting over (the) two customs options neither of which frankly are workable, neither of which are acceptable to the EU.”He added: ‘What we propose is a combination, on the one hand a comprehensive customs union, nobody credible suggests you can achieve no hard border (in Ireland) without it and also a strong single market relationship that hard wires the benefits of the single market into the future agreement.’MORE: Donald Trump says North Korea is ‘very smart’ for planning to close nuclear site"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/16/4C0E4F2300000578-5713953-image-a-6_1525966456420.jpg","title":"Behind scenes footage shows Meghan Markle fits giggles set forgetting lines","story":"    Behind-the-scenes footage of Meghan Markle on the TV drama Suits shows the actress dissolving into fits of giggles, dancing around the set and fluffing her lines          Outtakes from the first six series, show the close friendship between the princess-to-be and her co-stars Patrick J Adams and Sarah Rafferty          The off-cuts of the hit series Suits, which can be found on YouTube , under the titles \u0027Blooper Reel\u0027 or \u0027Gag Reel\u0027 give a fascinating insight into Meghan\u0027s personalityWill Prince Harry shave off his beard in time for the big...The hazard of a dukedom: If Harry and Meghan really want to...Meghan and Harry bring New York to a stand still... sort of:...Share this articleBut she does not appear in as many clips as the rest of the cast, showing how seriously she took her big break in the profession.Meghan, 36, who marries Prince Harry next Saturday, joined Suits in 2011, moving from Los Angeles to Toronto.But she has now admitted that she thought she had blown her audition for the role of paralegal Rachel Zane in the show, originally entitled A Legal Mind.In an interview with listings magazine Fan The Fire, she said: \u0027It was just like any other audition.\u0027I was sent the material and was asked to go and read for the producers.

Prince Albert had projected in 2016 that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimateNow with two children of his own, he told People magazine at the time that he purchased the property that he can\u0027t wait to make new memories there with his own children, twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella.\u0027I\u0027m looking forward to showing the house to the kids, sharing it with them, having them see the garden,\u0027 he said. He projected then that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimate.

They have been published in newspapers, magazines and on websites around the world.          1. Photographer Jeff Rayner, camera slung over his shoulder, arrives at the Omega internet cafe at 9.50am on March 27 with Thomas Markle          2.

Mr Markle and the photographer book time to use one of the computers, but are secretly planning to choreograph a photoshootIn all of them Mr Markle appears to be unaware they are being taken. But we can today reveal they were in fact contrived and shot with his co-operation. It is not known if he was paid to take part.The faked images include Mr Markle apparently:Being measured for a suit to wear to the wedding – in fact the ‘tailor’ was an assistant at a party goods shop recruited for the job as the suit hire store the photographer planned to use was closed.Being caught browsing a book of British landmarks in a branch of Starbucks – although he actually arrived at the cafe with the photographer, and set up the shot.Working out with weights to get in shape for the big day – but the pictures appear to have been taken on a waste tip, an unlikely place to exercise but away from prying eyes.The revelation that Mr Markle has been co-operating with a paparazzo behind the backs of his daughter, Prince Harry and Kensington Palace officials will cause huge embarrassment to the Royal Family in the run-up to the wedding. It will be galling for Harry who, in a BBC documentary last year, hit out at the paparazzi for the way in which they pursued his mother, Princess Diana. She was killed in Paris in 1997 after being chased by photographers.And shortly after his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, the Prince made a heartfelt plea for the media to respect the privacy of Meghan and her family.Last night, just hours ahead of our exposé, represenatives of Mr Markle wrote to editors around the world and to British newspaper watchdog the Independent Press Standards Organisation. Editors were told that he was suffering as a result of media intrusion and did not want to participate in photocalls or interviews.          4.

The letter urged editors not to publish pictures of Mr Markle and called on them to stop pursuing him.Mail on Sunday reporters have established that Mr Markle and Rayner, a 44-year-old Los Angeles-based photographer, set up at least four photoshoots.

Jamie Oliver has not appeared on The Sunday Times Rich List for the first time since he debuted on it in 2010BY SEBASTIAN MURPHY-BATES FOR MAILONLINE Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has dropped off the wealth list as his restaurant chain continues to struggle.It is the first time the chef from Essex has been missing from the list since he debuted on it in 2010.His Italian restaurant empire has racked up debts of £71.5million and its staff are owed £2.2million. In January Oliver announced he was closing 12 of his 37 Italian eateries after his food magazine, Jamie, went under last year. The restaurant closures put more than 200 jobs at risk, after creditors pushed through a restructuring plan devised by the chef. A Company Voluntary Arrangement will allow the Italian chain to secure rent reductions on the remaining estate and exit unprofitable stores.  When he closed six restaurants last year, Oliver blamed a combination of rising Brexit cost pressures and tough trading.           The celebrity chef\u0027s restaurant chain has been blighted by problems, which Oliver blamed on BrexitHis chain was stung by the collapse of the pound - which ramped up the cost of buying ingredients from Italy - as well as staff costs and lower footfall. Last month the chef said he could \u0027happily f****** retire\u0027 within the next 12 years as he bemoaned the fact that people blame him for taking away their turkey twizzlers.He told Balance magazine: \u0027I still get “Where’s my Turkey Twizzlers?”.

branding it \u0027crazy\u0027 and warning it would be a betrayal of the referendum vote.There are claims today that half the full Cabinet roster could also be opposed to the proposal - which would see the UK collect tariffs on behalf of Brussels and then offer businesses rebates.  Mr Coveney appeared to endorse Mrs May\u0027s vision of a partnership in an interview on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show.He said the UK had made a clear commitment in last December\u0027s agreed UK-EU text that there would be no physical infrastructure on the border.Boris Johnson (pictured attending Cabinet last week) launched an extraordinary public attack on Theresa May\u0027s post-Brexit trade plans          Mr Johnson responded to Mrs May\u0027s latest comments about Brexit on Twitter today\u0027That means we are not talking about cameras and scanning systems and drones here - it means we are talking about a political solution that allows for regulatory alignment in a way that prevents the need for border infrastructure,\u0027 he said.\u0027We are simply asking that that commitment be followed through on.\u0027Mr Coveney said: \u0027I\u0027m not flexible when it comes to border infrastructure, I never have been.\u0027 Tanaiste Mr Coveney said: \u0027To be honest we don\u0027t take our lead from Boris Johnson in relation to Brexit, we take our lead from the Prime Minister.\u0027She has signed up to very clear commitments, she has written to Donald Tusk (European Council President) confirming those commitments and I believe her by the way, I believe she made those commitments in good faith and I believe she wants to follow through on them.\u0027He said Brexit negotiations would face a \u0027difficult summer\u0027 if the UK Government failed to honour its commitment to agreeing a \u0027backstop\u0027 in the withdrawal treaty.The backstop would mean regulations between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would continue to align post-Brexit, even if a broader trading deal between the UK and EU failed to materialise.This concept has alarmed unionists, who believe it would end up creating trading barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, undermining the constitutional integrity of the kingdom.Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, one of Mr Coveney\u0027s most vocal critics, branded him \u0027belligerent, interfering and Brit bashing\u0027 and accused him of trying to break up the UK.The UK cabinet is currently ided on the issue, with detractors of the partnership concept instead advocating new technology and trusted trader schemes to enable smooth trade with the EU.Mr Johnson has been very critical of the idea of a partnership or shared customs territory, insisting it would prevent the UK taking back control of its trading policies.   What are the options on the table for a customs deal with the EU? With time ticking away on the Brexit negotiations, the Cabinet is still at daggers drawn on the shape for future trade relations with the EU.The government has set out two potential options for a customs system after the UK leaves the bloc.But despite a series of tense showdowns at Theresa May\u0027s Brexit \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 ministers continue to be deadlocked over what to do.Meanwhile, Brussels has dismissed both the ideas - and warned that negotiations could stall altogether unless there is progress by a key summit next month.                  Despite a series of tense showdowns at Theresa May\u0027s \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 (pictured in February) ministers continue to be deadlocked over what to doOPTION 1 - CUSTOMS PARTNERSHIP Under the so-called \u0027hybrid model\u0027, the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.Britain would be responsible for tracking the origin and final destination of goods coming into the country from outside the EU. The government would also have to ensure all products meet the bloc\u0027s standards.Firms selling directly into the UK market would pay the tariff levels set by Brussels - but would then get a rebate if Britain\u0027s tariffs are lower. Supporters of the hybrid plan in Cabinet - including Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Greg Clark - say keeping duties aligned up front would avoid the need for physical customs borders between the UK and EU.As a result it could solve the thorny issue over creating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Mrs May has been advised by the chief whip that the hybrid option could be the only way of securing a majority in parliament for a Brexit deal. But Brexiteers regard the proposal as unworkable and cumbersome - and they were joined by Sajid Javid and Gavin Williamson in criticising it at a tense \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 meeting last week.There are fears the experimental system will either collapse and cause chaos, or prevent the UK from being able to negotiate free trade deals around the world after Brexit.Mrs May has instructed official to go away and revise the ideas. Eurosceptics are braced for her to bring back the plan with only \u0027cosmetic\u0027 changes, and try to \u0027peel off\u0027 Mr Javid and Mr Williamson from the core group of Brexiteers.They are also ready for Mrs May to attempt to bypass the \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 altogether and put the issue before the whole Cabinet - where she has more allies. OPTION 2 - MAXIMUM FACILITATIONThe \u0027Max Fac\u0027 option accepts that there will be greater friction at Britain\u0027s borders with the EU. But it would aim to minimise the issues using technology and mutual recognition.Goods could be electronically tracked and pre-cleared by tax authorities on each side.Shipping firms could also be given \u0027trusted trader\u0027 status so they can move goods freely, and only pay tariffs when they are delivered to the destination country.Companies would also be trusted to ensure they were meeting the relevant UK and EU standards on products.Senior ministers such as Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Liam Fox believe this is the only workable option. But Remain minded Tories such as Mr Clark insist it will harm trade and cost jobs in the UK.They also warn that it will require more physical infrastructure on the Irish border - potentially breaching the Good Friday Agreement. It is far from clear whether the government would be able to force anything through parliament that implied a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  The EU has dismissed the idea that \u0027Max Fac\u0027 could prevent checks on the Irish border as \u0027magical thinking\u0027. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/11/1579796F000005DC-0-image-a-2_1526207005085.jpg","title":"Jamie Oliver drops Sunday Times Rich List time debut","story":"    Jamie Oliver has not appeared on The Sunday Times Rich List for the first time since he debuted on it in 2010In January Oliver announced he was closing 12 of his 37 Italian eateries after his food magazine, Jamie, went under last year. The restaurant closures put more than 200 jobs at risk, after creditors pushed through a restructuring plan devised by the chef.Ex-Hilton hotel chef who was on parole for armed robbery is...Share this articleA Company Voluntary Arrangement will allow the Italian chain to secure rent reductions on the remaining estate and exit unprofitable stores.  When he closed six restaurants last year, Oliver blamed a combination of rising Brexit cost pressures and tough trading.

The 50,000-tonne aircraft carrier is the first to be built and designed entirely in China and is set to become the Navy\u0027s seccond carrier by 2020          The runway on the new vessel models the skip slope design of its predecessor. Though China still lags behind the United States in terms of military might, the Communist government is increasing the country\u0027s dominance in Asia, where only Japan seriously rivals it          The vessel - temporarily named Type 001A - was sent out for sea trials at 7am today as President Xi Jinping pushes ahead with modernisation in the country\u0027s Navy. Experts say that it still won\u0027t be enough to seriously challenge the dominance of the USA within the next 12 yearsCurrently the country only has a retrofitted Soviet-era aircraft carrier called the Liaoning, which was launched in 2012. But CNN reports the new vessel still won\u0027t be enough to rival the United States, but will boost the navy\u0027s standing in Asia.  Sam Roggeveen, senior fellow at Sydney\u0027s Lowy Institute, said: \u0027This is, in and of itself, not designed to be some frontal challenge to US power in the Asia Pacific, because it simply isn\u0027t in the class of America\u0027s aircraft carriers.\u0027          China only has one aircraft carrier (pictured, the ship at its 2007 launch), which is called the Liaoning. It is a retrofitted Soviet-era vessel, showing the marked difference between the communist country\u0027s capabilities as compared with that of the US           The new aircraft carrier weighs 50,000 tonnes and analysis of recent satellite images suggest that modifications have been made for the ship to transport an additional eight aircraft. Unlike the nuclear-powered carriers the United States fields, the Chinese rely on less innovative means of propulsion More than 1,000 feet in length and 246 feet wide, the new ship uses conventional propulsion as opposed to nuclear and recent analysis of satellite images suggests modifications have been made to hold up to eight additional aircraft.Its predecessor was intended more as a training base, but the new ship is likely to be deployed for combat, putting China alongside the US, the UK, Russia and France in its global capability.  Trump\u0027s armada: Huge task force of 12 warships sets sail for...Red alert in the English Channel: Royal Navy\u0027s HMS St Albans...Having a BLAST! Booms ring out across London as HMS Belfast...Share this articleBut it is still the US that fields more aircraft carriers than any other country. As of this year it fields 11 nuclear-powered carriers with \u0027catapult\u0027 technology, in which pistons or electromagnetic rails speed aircraft up as they leave the runway. This gives them an advantage over the Chinese planes, which rely on their own power and the ski-jump designs on both carriers.          China has sent its first home-built aircraft carrier for sea trials as the Communist government attempts to assert its military might on the world stage. Unable to use electromagnetic rails to speed aircraft up as they leave the runway, the ship instead relies on a ski-jump design          The ship is China\u0027s latest attempt to assert its military might and follows a surge of investment from 2010 to 2017, when the Navy\u0027s ship complement increased from 210 to 320. The country is fast developing capabilities to maintain presence in distant waters  Once this latest addition passes sea trials, it will need to be further vetted before it is deemed combat-ready. And plenty can still go wrong during the current trial, as the UK\u0027s HMS Queen Elizabeth proved last year when a leak left it in need of repair.And the US Navy\u0027s newest warship - the USS Gerald R Ford - has been blighted by glitches despite it being the world\u0027s most expensive at $13 billion. The 100,000-tonne vessel\u0027s catapult launcher, the equipment for catching planes upon landing and its radar were all found to be faulty.  Although China is far from catching up with the US, its military budget this year rose by eight per cent as the military pushes for modernisation. The Navy\u0027s ship complement increased from 210 to 320 between 2010 and 2017, with 2016 alone seeing an increase of 18.  American sea power is expected to continue dominating over the next 10 years, but China is fast developing capabilities to maintain presence in distant waters.  Last week US intelligence suggested there is a high probability that the Chinese fired missiles to three artificial islands in military drills.    China\u0027s first homegrown aircraft carrier heads out for sea trial - CNN"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/01/4C28951B00000578-0-image-a-9_1526171811008.jpg","title":"For Futures Sake FFS university group writes MPs stop Brexit","story":"    For Our Future\u0027s Sake is a new collective that represents 60 student unions from different universities across the country.

Pompeo said that Trump and Kim Jong-un would meet in Singapore on June 12 to \u0027see if there is sufficient overlap so that we can achieve the ultimate objective for the American people\u0027 of denuclearization of the Korean PeninsulaThe nation\u0027s top diplomat met with Kim on two occasions over the course of the month, first as CIA director and more recently in his capacity as secretary of state, providing him with greater insight into the 33-year-old head of the hermit nation than any other American, aside from basketball player Dennis Rodman.Pompeo says it is his belief that Kim, who took over from his father in 2011, \u0027understands\u0027 that in order to strike a deal with the U.S. \u0027this is going to have to be different and big and special, and something that has never been undertaken before.\u0027If we are going to get to this historic outcome, both sides have to be prepared to take a truly measures to achieve it,\u0027 he said.As the secretary of state, Pompeo said it\u0027s his job to lay the groundwork for a thawing of tensions.\u0027I think we now understand that there is the potential that there are shared objectives,\u0027 he said.As for his own talks with Kim, Pompeo said, \u0027The conversations are professional...He knows his brief, he knows what he is trying to achieve for the North Korean people. He is able to deal with complexity when the conversation requires it. \u0027He does follow the Western press. He will probably watch the show at some point,\u0027 Pompeo told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. \u0027He\u0027s paying attention to things the world is saying. He too is preparing for June 12th. He and his team, we’ll be working with them to put our two leaders in a position where it\u0027s just possible we might pull off an historic undertaking.\u0027          The nation\u0027s top diplomat met with Kim on two occasions over the course of the month. He said Kim \u0027understands\u0027 that in order to strike a deal with the U.S. \u0027this is going to have to be different and big and special, and something that has never been undertaken before\u0027Any deal with North Korea will only be possible if the foreign government that has an economy crashing under the weight of international sanctions feels its financially worth it.Pompeo on Friday said Pyongyang could look forward to a \u0027future brimming with peace and prosperity\u0027 if it gives up its pursuit of nuclear weapons.The lifting of sanctions would allow American companies to enter into contracts with North Korea to rebuild the county\u0027s national infrastructure. Once it\u0027s off the blacklist, Pyongyang could also be eligible for international aid.Sen. Lindsey Graham on CBS on Sunday said, \u0027If you could really get North Korea to give up their nuclear program than I think there\u0027d be a lot of support in Congress to give North Korea a better life. \u0027Provide aid, relieve sanctions with one condition: that you give up your nuclear weapons program in a verifiable way. When it comes to North Korea, I think there’d be a lot of congressional support,\u0027 he said.Bolton on CNN\u0027s \u0027State of the Union\u0027 slapped down the idea of aid to North Korea, however. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t look for economic aid from us,\u0027 he asserted. \u0027I think what the prospect for North Korea is to become a normal nation, to behave and interact with the rest of the world the way South Korea does.\u0027Pompeo told Fox that he was talking about private-sector investments when he made the remark. \u0027Not the U.S. taxpayer, private-sector Americans helping build the energy grid,\u0027 he said. \u0027They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea, to work with them to develop infrastructure. All the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea so they can eat meat and have healthy lives.\u0027Even if Trump and Kim agree on the contours of a deal during their Singapore summit, it would most likely need the support of Congress. Former President Barack Obama bypassed lawmakers in 2015 when his administration entered into a nuclear agreement with Tehran to the fury of Republicans who said that only Congress has the authority to approve treaty documents.Bolton on Sunday indicated that the Republican administration was considering proceeding the same way now that Trump is the one in office. \u0027Well it’s entirely possible we’d proceed that way, we’re still thinking about the different alternatives, I wouldn’t want to foreclose the president’s options,\u0027 he said of congressional approval. He admitted in the next breath though that \u0027it’s been one of the criticisms of the Iran nuclear deal to be sure...that a deal of that level of consequence was not given to the Senate as many people think the Constitution provided.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/17/4C2E79F100000578-0-image-a-41_1526230355849.jpg","title":"Mushroom hunters two headed fawn Minnesota forest","story":"    Wild Images In Motion Taxidermy positioned the conjoined fawns on a bed of greenery \u0027There are a few reported cases of two-headed ungulate fetuses, but nothing delivered to term.

They have been published in newspapers, magazines and on websites around the world.          1. Photographer Jeff Rayner, camera slung over his shoulder, arrives at the Omega internet cafe at 9.50am on March 27 with Thomas Markle          2.

Mr Markle and the photographer book time to use one of the computers, but are secretly planning to choreograph a photoshootIn all of them Mr Markle appears to be unaware they are being taken. But we can today reveal they were in fact contrived and shot with his co-operation. It is not known if he was paid to take part.The faked images include Mr Markle apparently:Being measured for a suit to wear to the wedding – in fact the ‘tailor’ was an assistant at a party goods shop recruited for the job as the suit hire store the photographer planned to use was closed.Being caught browsing a book of British landmarks in a branch of Starbucks – although he actually arrived at the cafe with the photographer, and set up the shot.Working out with weights to get in shape for the big day – but the pictures appear to have been taken on a waste tip, an unlikely place to exercise but away from prying eyes.The revelation that Mr Markle has been co-operating with a paparazzo behind the backs of his daughter, Prince Harry and Kensington Palace officials will cause huge embarrassment to the Royal Family in the run-up to the wedding. It will be galling for Harry who, in a BBC documentary last year, hit out at the paparazzi for the way in which they pursued his mother, Princess Diana. She was killed in Paris in 1997 after being chased by photographers.And shortly after his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, the Prince made a heartfelt plea for the media to respect the privacy of Meghan and her family.Last night, just hours ahead of our exposé, represenatives of Mr Markle wrote to editors around the world and to British newspaper watchdog the Independent Press Standards Organisation. Editors were told that he was suffering as a result of media intrusion and did not want to participate in photocalls or interviews.          4.

The letter urged editors not to publish pictures of Mr Markle and called on them to stop pursuing him.Mail on Sunday reporters have established that Mr Markle and Rayner, a 44-year-old Los Angeles-based photographer, set up at least four photoshoots.

branding it \u0027crazy\u0027 and warning it would be a betrayal of the referendum vote.There are claims today that half the full Cabinet roster could also be opposed to the proposal - which would see the UK collect tariffs on behalf of Brussels and then offer businesses rebates.  Mr Coveney appeared to endorse Mrs May\u0027s vision of a partnership in an interview on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show.He said the UK had made a clear commitment in last December\u0027s agreed UK-EU text that there would be no physical infrastructure on the border.Boris Johnson (pictured attending Cabinet last week) launched an extraordinary public attack on Theresa May\u0027s post-Brexit trade plans          Mr Johnson responded to Mrs May\u0027s latest comments about Brexit on Twitter today\u0027That means we are not talking about cameras and scanning systems and drones here - it means we are talking about a political solution that allows for regulatory alignment in a way that prevents the need for border infrastructure,\u0027 he said.\u0027We are simply asking that that commitment be followed through on.\u0027Mr Coveney said: \u0027I\u0027m not flexible when it comes to border infrastructure, I never have been.\u0027 Tanaiste Mr Coveney said: \u0027To be honest we don\u0027t take our lead from Boris Johnson in relation to Brexit, we take our lead from the Prime Minister.\u0027She has signed up to very clear commitments, she has written to Donald Tusk (European Council President) confirming those commitments and I believe her by the way, I believe she made those commitments in good faith and I believe she wants to follow through on them.\u0027He said Brexit negotiations would face a \u0027difficult summer\u0027 if the UK Government failed to honour its commitment to agreeing a \u0027backstop\u0027 in the withdrawal treaty.The backstop would mean regulations between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would continue to align post-Brexit, even if a broader trading deal between the UK and EU failed to materialise.This concept has alarmed unionists, who believe it would end up creating trading barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, undermining the constitutional integrity of the kingdom.Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, one of Mr Coveney\u0027s most vocal critics, branded him \u0027belligerent, interfering and Brit bashing\u0027 and accused him of trying to break up the UK.The UK cabinet is currently ided on the issue, with detractors of the partnership concept instead advocating new technology and trusted trader schemes to enable smooth trade with the EU.Mr Johnson has been very critical of the idea of a partnership or shared customs territory, insisting it would prevent the UK taking back control of its trading policies.   What are the options on the table for a customs deal with the EU? With time ticking away on the Brexit negotiations, the Cabinet is still at daggers drawn on the shape for future trade relations with the EU.The government has set out two potential options for a customs system after the UK leaves the bloc.But despite a series of tense showdowns at Theresa May\u0027s Brexit \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 ministers continue to be deadlocked over what to do.Meanwhile, Brussels has dismissed both the ideas - and warned that negotiations could stall altogether unless there is progress by a key summit next month.                  Despite a series of tense showdowns at Theresa May\u0027s \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 (pictured in February) ministers continue to be deadlocked over what to doOPTION 1 - CUSTOMS PARTNERSHIP Under the so-called \u0027hybrid model\u0027, the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.Britain would be responsible for tracking the origin and final destination of goods coming into the country from outside the EU. The government would also have to ensure all products meet the bloc\u0027s standards.Firms selling directly into the UK market would pay the tariff levels set by Brussels - but would then get a rebate if Britain\u0027s tariffs are lower. Supporters of the hybrid plan in Cabinet - including Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Greg Clark - say keeping duties aligned up front would avoid the need for physical customs borders between the UK and EU.As a result it could solve the thorny issue over creating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Mrs May has been advised by the chief whip that the hybrid option could be the only way of securing a majority in parliament for a Brexit deal. But Brexiteers regard the proposal as unworkable and cumbersome - and they were joined by Sajid Javid and Gavin Williamson in criticising it at a tense \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 meeting last week.There are fears the experimental system will either collapse and cause chaos, or prevent the UK from being able to negotiate free trade deals around the world after Brexit.Mrs May has instructed official to go away and revise the ideas. Eurosceptics are braced for her to bring back the plan with only \u0027cosmetic\u0027 changes, and try to \u0027peel off\u0027 Mr Javid and Mr Williamson from the core group of Brexiteers.They are also ready for Mrs May to attempt to bypass the \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 altogether and put the issue before the whole Cabinet - where she has more allies. OPTION 2 - MAXIMUM FACILITATIONThe \u0027Max Fac\u0027 option accepts that there will be greater friction at Britain\u0027s borders with the EU. But it would aim to minimise the issues using technology and mutual recognition.Goods could be electronically tracked and pre-cleared by tax authorities on each side.Shipping firms could also be given \u0027trusted trader\u0027 status so they can move goods freely, and only pay tariffs when they are delivered to the destination country.Companies would also be trusted to ensure they were meeting the relevant UK and EU standards on products.Senior ministers such as Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Liam Fox believe this is the only workable option. But Remain minded Tories such as Mr Clark insist it will harm trade and cost jobs in the UK.They also warn that it will require more physical infrastructure on the Irish border - potentially breaching the Good Friday Agreement. It is far from clear whether the government would be able to force anything through parliament that implied a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  The EU has dismissed the idea that \u0027Max Fac\u0027 could prevent checks on the Irish border as \u0027magical thinking\u0027. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/13/16F473B8000005DC-5723437-image-a-1_1526214910734.jpg","title":"Religious believers told wear crucifixes","story":"    It comes five years after British Airways employee Nadia Eweida (pictured) won her case against the airline when she was told to hide her cross while at work          A nurse, Shirley Chaplin (pictured), did not win a similar challenge, however.

That should bring forward the remainder of the new capacity needed as coal drops off the grid.WWF also called on the government to reconsider support for solar power and onshore windfarms, both of which have had subsidies axed. He added that he was encouraged by recent comments from the energy minister, Claire Perry, who has said the government is working “really hard” to allow onshore windfarms to be built with public subsidies in Scotland and Wales but not England.A spokesperson for Drax said: “A reliable power system depends on a range of generation technologies to provide crucial system support services.”Tom Glover, the UK country chair for RWE, said: “The exact amount of gas capacity required is extremely uncertain but the vast majority of forecasts anticipate a significantly higher requirement than suggested in this report.”A BEIS spokesperson said:“We are one of the first countries to commit to end unabated coal power and are leading the world in encouraging other countries to make the same commitment. With clean growth a key pillar of our modern industrial strategy, we are growing our economy while cutting emissions.“With up to £557m of investment in new clean energy projects we have a erse energy mix that is secure, affordable and providing more clean power than ever before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60dfafebcf14d0639d9a5e6ed5c19f7a1b5b8233/0_130_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4eca5dea104f74fbd57ffa9a3ec7b11e","title":"choking women me too breath play","story":"Choking seems to be in fashion, and I don’t mean the type where you need the Heimlich maneuverChoking seems to be in fashion, and I don’t mean the type where you need the Heimlich maneuver. Since the #MeToo movement, we’re learning just how many men seem to see choking women as a legitimate form of “sex play,” as it is often euphemistically referred to in porn. Eric Schneiderman, New York State’s Attorney General, who announced he was pursuing a lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein for what he described as “despicable” behavior, was just forced to resign after four women accused him of choking them, as well as other types of physical assault. Schneiderman disputed the allegations, claiming that he had only consensual sexual relations.As more and more stories surface, thanks to the #MeToo movement, women are trying to make sense of why so many men are sexually abusive and get aroused by abusive acts such as choking. For feminists who research porn, this is no surprise. The domestication of the internet and the introduction of the smart phone made porn affordable, anonymous, and accessible, the main drivers of demand. Pornhub, the most traveled porn site in the world, boasts in its annual “Year in Review” that it had approximately 28.5 billion visitors in 2017, which translates into about 81 million per day. Pornhub claims that “a total of 3,732 Petabytes of data was streamed in 2017, which makes for 7,101 GB per minute and 118 GB per second.” To put this in perspective, Pornhub claims that this “is enough data to fill the storage of all of the world’s iPhones currently in use.” When you click on Pornhub, you’ll find at the top a tab marked “Categories.” The user has over 80 of these to choose from, some of the most popular being MILF, Teen, Stepmom, and Step Sister. What you won’t see is a category called “choking,” because this form of sexual violence is one of the most common acts across all categories. Women are choked with anything from a penis to a fist to the point of gagging, and in some cases almost passing out. The victim obviously can’t speak during these acts because she is choking, so it is typically not until the end of the scene that she says, often in a hoarse voice, how much she “loved it.” Meanwhile, she looks exhausted, upset, and—in some cases—distraught. In mainstream media targeted to women, choking, or “breath play,” as it is often referred to, is rebranded as edgy, hot sex that somehow gives the woman power. Women’s Health Magazine recently promoted the act, suggesting it can “be an exhilarating experience for some people.” While the article does admit it could lead to death, it nonetheless provides some handy tips for those women squeamish at the thought of this “hot” sex. (Learning to relax is one recommendation!) The authors quote a sex therapist who manages to flip the power dynamics by arguing that the “turn on” is that he is prepared to do anything to have you, and the result is that “you feel you have an erotic power over him.” Not all batterers got the idea of choking a woman from porn, but over 40 years of research shows a connection between viewing porn and violence against women. A recent meta-analysis of 22 studies between 1978 and 2014 from seven different countries concluded that pornography consumption is associated with an increased likelihood of committing acts of verbal or physical sexual aggression, regardless of age. It is ironic that as women are speaking out loud and clear, the porn industry, together with mainstream pop culture, is promoting choking. In so many ways, choking women is a perfect metaphor for how women have been silenced. Women cannot speak the truth of their lives as long as men have their hands round our necks, or their penises down our throats. As women continue to build this movement, the research and the testimonies of women hurt by porn need to be front and center. A cultural context for understanding why men sexually abuse women, at the levels they do, ironically provides us with hope, because what has been socially constructed can always be socially deconstructed.

It was one of the great privileges of my life to know Tessa Jowell well, and one I shared with so many. At the dinner table, at the tea party to celebrate her introduction to the House of Lords, at book launches, at Labour conferences, she was always surrounded by friends, making new ones, and bringing together previously unconnected members of her prodigious circle of affection and affinity.When Hashi Mohamed, the barrister and broadcaster, and I met at a conference in Warwick last November, our very first instinct was to take a selfie and send it to our mutual friend Tessa. She replied delightedly, promising “to plot and plan” with us when she returned from her next round of cancer treatment in Cologne. Even afflicted by a brain tumour, glioblastoma multiforme, she always looked to the future, to the next, to the possible.Grief breeds aphasia: we cling to platitudes so we can keep talking at all. But we owe it to Tessa to speak of her with precision as well as love to honour the grit and detail of her achievements as much as the luminous decency that underpinned them.I first encountered her as a fellow member of the Millennium Commission, a lottery-distributing fund, and witnessed, in her conduct as chair, the steely pragmatism that coursed through her impeccably amiable manner. She understood the necessity of getting the job done – no small task when the job in question was selling the much-derided Dome. At the time, the task seemed next to impossible. Today, the O2 is one of the most successful entertainment complexes in the country.For Tessa, progress was never an abstraction to be pursued according to an ideological rule-book. As she observed in her speech to mark the 10th anniversary of the 77 attacks: “The danger comes from any belief system which is closed, which provides to its believer the single answer to everything, whose adherents can’t stand outside their system to ask themselves the question, ‘Is what I am doing in the cause I believe in actually right?’”Fastidious in manners, she was resolutely tough in her practicality. In this spirit of dedication, she reminded me of Margaret Atwood’s Nell in the short story Moral Disorder: “She would turn into a woman others came to for advice. She would be called in emergencies. She would roll up her sleeves and dispense with sentimentality …”In the implementation of public health policy, the creation of Sure Start, the establishment of Ofcom, or the coordination of the government’s support for those bereaved or harmed by the 77 bombings, she always grasped that good intentions, though essential, were not enough that the better angels of our nature do not take flight without persistence, collaboration and robust leadership.Nowhere was this more apparent than in her ministerial stewardship of London’s campaign for the 2012 Olympics, of the fiendishly complex preparations and infrastructural work, and of the Games themselves. She was deeply affected by the cruel proximity of the announcement of the London bid’s success in 2005, and the terrorist attack upon the same city the very next day.That juxtaposition exemplified for her the fundamental dichotomy of human behaviour and the obstacles that confront those who believe in the common good and the pursuit of decency. If we shun despair – as we ought to – we must undertake a permanent struggle against entropy, indifference and bigotry. “The decency and civility which normally prevail,” she remarked, “are not a solid impermeable layer.”So, too, she embodied hope rather than naivety. When she phoned friends last year to tell them about her illness, she was full of both optimism and realism, determined to seek whatever treatment she could find, to deploy her voice and political skills to improve the lot of other cancer patients, and, above all, to relish her time with her adored family – not least the grandchild, Ottie, she had helped to deliver weeks before her diagnosis.The notion of cancer as a “battle” is both absurd and morally contemptible, implying, as it does, that the illness is a test of character or virtue. That said, Tessa did declare war upon cancer as a scourge upon humanity, with remarkable consequences. She and her daughter, Jess Mills, founded the organisation Adaptive Collaborative Treatments (ACT), dedicated to more flexible care, greater access to experimental trials and enhanced global cooperation.As she put it in her speech in the House of Lords in January: “For what would every cancer patient want? To know that the best, the latest science was being used – wherever in the world it was developed, whoever began it.” In the same speech – which inspired a standing ovation – she observed that “while doctors look at the big picture, we can all be part of the human-sized picture”.This was not only a statement of fact it was an injunction to action. No politician I have known better understood the relationship between the inidual and society, the connective tissue that binds them, and how remorselessly it must be nurtured.In the case of cancer treatment, we all face a straightforward choice. One of the world’s leading biomedical scientists told me last week that the disease as we presently understand it can be eradicated within 10 or 20 years – if there is the political will to fund the research and, more to the point, the radical new treatments that are already forthcoming. There is astonishing wealth in this country, waiting to be taxed to fund this and other forms of health and social care in our transforming society. The time is coming when we must ask: do we seriously value our property more than our fellow human beings?Such are the tough questions posed by mortality. One of Tessa’s favourite quotations was from Thornton Wilder’s The Bridge of San Luis Rey: “There is a land of the living and a land of the dead and the bridge is love, the only survival, the only meaning.” Now that she has made the crossing, let this be her message of consolation, and her challenge to the rest of us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a2e097967263355b4c5306f4d3141eebd5132e0/69_58_2588_1553/master/2588.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73e73e216b37bb35eaeea7f32bb05392","title":"the guardian view on brexit and parliament another way is possible","story":"Under normal circumstances, a government with vital laws to pass in a short space of time would get a move\u0026nbspon.\u0026nbspBut not much about Brexit is normal. The clock is ticking, yet the bill to enable an orderly withdrawal next\u0026nbspMarch is marooned.Peers voted for amendments to soften the character of Brexit. Uncertain of how this will play out in the lower chamber, the government last week declined to send the bill straight there as would be usual practice. And it isn’t only the withdrawal bill in limbo. Bills on customs and trade are frozen in early stages of the process. Last year’s Queen’s speech promised bills on fisheries, farming and immigration, of which there is as yet no sign.In the autumn, parliament is supposed to vote on a motion to approve the terms of withdrawal negotiated by Theresa May and a declaration of intent covering the broad framework for post-Brexit trade. The withdrawal deal must also be enacted via an implementation bill, running the full gauntlet of primary legislation.MPs will struggle to get through this logjam in a way that permits due diligence on the most ambitious and dangerous undertaking by any British government since\u0026nbspthe second world war. If Mrs May tries to force Brexit through in this fashion she will be asking MPs for\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspblank political cheque to sign off on a future shrouded in a dense fog of uncertainty.What began as misfortune is evolving into a desperate tactic by the prime minister. By leaving everything to the last minute, she narrows the options, betting that parliament will have to acquiesce since the alternatives would risk political, economic and constitutional meltdown. In a newspaper article on Sunday, Mrs\u0026nbspMay asked for public trust on Brexit, but can’t or won’t explain how she means to break the current deadlock. This is not the way government business of the highest urgency should be conducted. But Mrs May feels trapped. She cannot get her cabinet to agree on technical aspects of Brexit nor even on the fundamental principles that would lead to technical solutions. And she doesn’t have a majority in parliament for the kind of Brexit – outside the customs union, outside the single market – that many of her backbench MPs and key ministers demand.These look like two problems – a split party and a hung parliament – but they are in fact one. Or,\u0026nbsprather,\u0026nbspviewed through a non-party lens, a single solution comes into view. There is an available parliamentary majority for a different Brexit, a much softer model that starts from the economically rational base of customs union and single market membership. The readiness of politicians from across party lines to support such a position will be underlined in a joint intervention on Monday by Nick Clegg, former Liberal Democrat leader, David\u0026nbspMiliband, former Labour foreign secretary, and Nicky Morgan, Tory chair of the Treasury select committee. None of them speaks for the whole of their respective parties, but they do express a view that would win the\u0026nbspsupport of a larger parliamentary caucus than the\u0026nbspone that Mrs May could whip behind a more hardline anti-EU prospectus.If the prime minister were to change course, the hardliners would denounce her for betraying pro-Brexit voters. They would be wrong in law and principle. Anything that ends full UK membership of the EU is a valid Brexit and partial detachment would be a more democratic expression of the close referendum result than total severance. The\u0026nbsp2016 vote does not prohibit a soft Brexit. The 2017 general election result demands one by virtue of parliamentary arithmetic alone. To deliver it, the prime minister would have to relinquish the support of the most fanatical Tory caucus, but she could make up the numbers with support from opposition MPs.There are enough who would see it as their patriotic duty to set aside tribal allegiance and help the prime minister rescue the country from its current destructive trajectory. The question is whether Mrs May has the courage and imagination to broker such a deal. The evidence of her past behaviour suggests not, yet the logic of the current Brexit impasse leaves no better option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b79d3b0625e6947ba5272ab4a23b91329f1a83ec/98_1959_2674_1603/master/2674.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1196aca3d4f85f4e2e4e3b59fd7246f9 700w","title":"the divisive issue of grammar schools returns","story":"The government’s decision to expand the provision of grammar schools (Report, 11 May) is consistent with the underlying trend in Britain’s society since the 1970s. British education is not intended to prepare children for life: it is structured to exclude those who don’t really understand what is required of them. The intention is not to reduce inequality, but to reward the existence of inequality. Our economy continues to discard iniduals and groups that fail to generate a sustainable personal income. Benefit payments are being withdrawn to encourage people to work more effectively or, alternatively, to reduce their standard of living to match their work contribution.Two thousand years ago, to quell discontent, the Roman emperor, August, decreed that the recipients of the free monthly dole of grain would increase to one fifth of the population. The Tories are currently implementing cuts in free grain, free education and free healthcare. Brexit will mean a cut in benefits. The conclusion will not be pretty.Martin LondonHenllan, Denbighshire\u0026nbsp• In one sense the proposed expansion of grammar school places represents a failure of nerve. If Damian Hinds really believes in the case he’s presenting (Report, 11 May), he and his government would be seeking to reverse the grammar school ban in the Commons but they know that would be defeated.In a second sense it’s a massive, if misguided, assertion of nerve: how has he the nerve to find extra millions for selective education at a time of a national schools funding crisis.Professor Colin RichardsSpark Bridge, Cumbria• So the government is giving money to expand grammar schools for the benefit of “disadvantaged pupils”. These pupils are 11 years old. This is the government that has spent years pulling the rug out from under these same children – from the closure of Sure Start to the welfare changes – with the consequent rise in the numbers of children living in poverty. No child in wealthy Britain should be “disadvantaged” at 11 years old and addressing that from birth is surely the job of government.Alison PierceBuxted, East Sussex• Keen to highlight that his new policy “provides access to world-class education”, Damian Hinds glosses over the UK’s geography, the many counties with no such provision, the vast majority of schools conveniently concentrated in the most affluent areas of the UK. Only those who indulge in Tory spin would agree this benefits families of all backgrounds and locations. What is apparent is that this government is not living up to Hinds’ promise of “helping all schools grow”. Children in mainstream primary and secondary education have seen £2.8bn of cuts since 2015, with further cuts planned by 2020 – cuts that will have a profound effect on an entire generation. There is nothing world class about that.Bridget JamesSwaffham, NorfolkNo doubt the parties reckon the Church of England and the Roman Catholic church are too powerful to be tangled with. This unlikely victory for cohesion and inclusiveness, following a sustained and widely supported campaign led by Humanists UK, may bring politicians at last to realise that the churches’ historic control of one-third of our schools is not unchallengeable after all. The case against faith schools has been made time and again – they are religiously, socially and ethnically isive, owe their marginally better academic results solely to their selective admissions practices, and too often deny pupils a balanced education in sensitive areas. Yet almost every penny they spend is provided by the public.All the arguments are there for the courageous party that dares to call the churches’ bluff – as the bluff has now been called of a notably deceptive and self-interested campaign by the Catholic Education Service.David PollockLondon• Join the debate – email • Read more  letters – click here to visit guletters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d06196d1c48096603ef60c2cd64fa5d942839330/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b71aa569cde407f19426af8fe74ec060","title":"leave no trace review debra granik","story":"Debra Granik’s complex study of an army vet and his daughter living in a vast public park is the film Captain Fantastic should have beenDebra Granik is the exceptional film-maker who directed Winter’s Bone in 2010, launching the career of Jennifer Lawrence, and now she returns with this deeply intelligent, complex, finely tuned and observed movie, adapted by Granik and her screenwriting partner, Anne Rosellini, from the novel My Abandonment by Peter Rock. Their new title alludes the rules of respect and care for the environment promoted by ecological campaigners: to minimise human impact on nature.Weirdly, this film initially reminded me of a fatuous and naive (and bafflingly overpraised) film called Captain Fantastic, which features Viggo Mortensen as a charismatic, disciplinarian dad who has taken his children to live with him in the wilderness. Leave No Trace is everything that that movie should have been: careful, realistic, with a sense of what is possible and what is at stake for those people who really do attempt to turn their backs on conventional living and also reject the stigma of homelessness — but what is also at stake for their children who have had no choice in the matter.Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie play Will and Tom, a grizzled army veteran and his 13-year-old daughter. The question of Tom’s mother is not addressed. Will and Tom are living a kind of radical Thoreau-guerrilla existence in a huge public park in Portland, Oregon. They have built a secret camp with tarps and rudimentary cooking implements, making their own fires. They share a tent. They read books. They have military-style drills for staying undercover. Periodically, they amble out of the park and into the city, where Will can pick up his prescription for ovoid painkillers at the vets hospital, which he can discreetly sell for cash on the black market to buy food — and then they return to the jungle. It seems like a perfect, even Edenic setup. But then Tom carelessly allows herself to be spotted by a hiker and things take a wrong turn.The personae of Will and Tom are strikingly restrained, both in their conception and performance: there is an attractive humility and restraint at work, a quietism. No scenery-chewing, no fireworks, no obvious scary-Colonel-Kurtz stuff from Will or obvious teen rebellion histrionics from Tom. Neither appears concerned with what the future holds for them, nor when Tom should really be getting a tent of her own – let alone meet other people her own age.When they are picked up by the authorities, they are subject to very similar psychiatric assessments, in which they have to respond true or false to questions about whether they have dark thoughts, etc. In some ways, these tests are callous, soulless – precisely the kind of bureaucratic intrusion that Will has passionately rejected on his own behalf and that of his daughter. And yet it is clear that this is the first time either of them have considered these questions – the first time they have really thought about themselves. Perhaps not having to think about yourself, not having to shoulder the burden of relentless neurotic self-examination, is part of what their way of life is about.Interestingly, getting picked up and then escaping is also part of their way of life. They have clearly planned for what happens. They have to accept – or pretend to accept – the social services’ remedial plans for them before they can slip away once more. There is a great sequence in which they attend a church service, blandly complaisant, not making a fuss, not standing out, biding their time. Or rather it is Will who is biding his time Tom isn’t so sure. Each time away from the wild brings Tom into contact with a society that she rather likes. Poignantly, she loves the rabbit that a neighbouring farmer’s kid has, and there is a lovely scene where she attends a rabbit-training school. Later, she has the same connection with honeybees. A split is coming. But Granik manages this crisis with cool, unhammy clarity. The intimacy and love between Will and Tom is presented with real delicacy. It’s a movie that will live with me for a long time.

Mohamed Salah began an emphatic defeat of Brighton with a record 32nd goal of the league campaign and another Kop favourite, Andy Robertson, closed it with his first for the club. Anfield absorbed the exhibition in between.“The perfect finale to a very exciting, intense season,” said Jürgen Klopp. “We showed again the kind of football that we couldn’t in the last few games because the boys are human, not machines.”Salah’s contribution this season suggests otherwise. The Egypt international ended the afternoon with the Golden Boot, presented by Kenny Dalglish while his young daughter, Makka, enjoyed a kick-about, and as the most prolific goalscorer in a 38-game Premier League season, eclipsing Luis Suárez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Alan Shearer in the process.Salah has not been the only Liverpool player to deliver consistently when it mattered. Klopp’s team qualified for the Champions League for a second season running with an unbeaten home record. This sunny Sunday-afternoon stroll against Chris Hughton’s side was also the 14th occasion that Liverpool scored four or more goals in a game. Only once, in 1895-96, has that record been bettered.Klopp said of his leading goalscorer: “It’s fantastic what he has done. The last few weeks especially were difficult with every single day someone saying how brilliant you are and giving you an Oscar for this, an award for that, even getting out of the car without having an accident. This gives us a big boost. Imagine if the only chance to get into the Champions League was to win the Champions League final. That’s maybe not the best option to choose, but it’s exciting now.”Brighton, survival ensured and their own season a success, tried to deliver a contest but were outclassed to such an extent that their neat passing game was confined to their own penalty area. They had nowhere else to go. Liverpool laid siege to Matthew Ryan’s goal from the start with Klopp picking Dominic Solanke on top of his imperious front three and seeing his team take complete control. Only poor finishing, overelaboration and Kevin Friend’s aversion to giving penalties delayed the inevitable.The referee was well-placed when Shane Duffy handled a cross and felled Salah but waved away both appeals. When Sadio Mané then shot straight at Ryan having been played clean through by the impressive Solanke it could have been a cue for apprehension among the home fans. But they appear immune to that these days. There is a belief in their team’s potency that the unerring accuracy of Salah has helped cement and the first time he found space inside a crowded Brighton area another record fell at his feet.Salah broke the Premier League scoring record when Trent Alexander-Arnold drove through the Brighton midfield and found Solanke on the edge of the area. The striker turned the ball on to Salah, who needed one touch to create space for a low left-foot finish. It was his 44th goal in total this season. A hat-trick against Real Madrid on 26 May will be required to equal Ian Rush’s all-time Liverpool\u0026nbsprecord.Dejan Lovren delivered the comfort of a two-goal lead with a towering header from Robertson’s inviting cross after Brighton cleared a corner but left the centre-half unmarked for the return ball. The cushion should have arrived earlier but Mané, having found himself through on goal once more, attempted to gift-wrap a second for Salah and enabled Ryan to intercept before Duffy blocked his second attempt on the goalline. Klopp went apoplectic in his technical area at Liverpool’s indulgence. It never seemed likely to cost them.Georginio Wijnaldum and Roberto Firmino wasted excellent chances before the break – several in the Brazilian’s case – but the scoreline offered a more accurate reflection of Liverpool’s dominance when Solanke struck his first league goal for the club. It was an excellent finish too, created by Salah, who took Firmino’s pass and evaded two challenges before releasing Solanke inside the area. The Chelsea graduate gave Ryan no chance with a powerful drive that flew in via the underside of the bar.To cap a perfect afternoon for Klopp’s team the final goal of the home season fell to the popular Robertson, perfectly placed to open his Liverpool account after Danny Ings’ cross deflected into his path. Adding to the manager’s satisfaction was the complete absence of fatigue in his players, something that had slowed their approach to the finishing line, having had a week to prepare for Brighton. A fortnight before Kiev looks ideal.“A few people have asked me whether it’s too long but no, it’s perfect,” said Klopp. “It’s like a little pre-season for us. The boys need a little bit of rest. We will give them two days now and then we will go to a camp. We will not train high intensity, we will do a little tactical stuff, a little fitness work, keep them in shape and then we have five days to prepare for the last game. We are all happy about that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d02e30ca639fd8f8c2d43054cf02419c31aa3f3c/44_193_4172_2503/master/4172.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=062624d387051e6fc9d0b684c457419d","title":"mauricio pochettino spurs future daniel levy spending transfers","story":"Mauricio Pochettino appeared to suggest that his future at Tottenham Hotspur is linked to how the club approach the summer transfer window, as he called upon the chairman, Daniel Levy, to “be brave and take risks”.The manager has been permitted to spend £40.25m in net terms on permanent transfer deals across his four seasons at Tottenham and he has delivered a third consecutive top-three finish and Champions League qualification.From a position of strength, Pochettino sent a message to Levy that sounded suspiciously like an ultimatum: if the club want to take the next step to the biggest trophies, they have to invest more lavishly in top signings.Pochettino was asked whether he would definitely be at the club next season. He had been asked the same question last Friday and, once again, he gave an ambiguous answer.Pochettino needed no second invitation to enter into great detail about how the club could improve. “I have very clear ideas of what we need to do,” Pochettino said. “I don’t know if the club will agree with me or not. We are going to talk next week to create the new project. It is a little bit up to Daniel and the club to agree with us.“I think Daniel is going to listen to me, of course. You need to be brave. Being brave is the most important thing and take risks.

Maybe his players were saving themselves for\u0026nbspthe FA\u0026nbspCup final but they never looked remotely like a side who kicked off harbouring outside hopes of a top‑four place.Ultimately Liverpool’s demolition of Brighton ensured Chelsea were destined to finish fifth but a performance when they were dominated by Newcastle’s outstanding Jonjo Shelvey, Mo Diamé and Ayoze Pérez was hardly what their manager will have wanted on what is expected to be his final Premier League match in charge\u0026nbspof London’s most politicised\u0026nbspclub.Conte said later that he was the “last person” to answer questions about Chelsea’s future. He did, though, take his players to task for their attitude and application here and warned them to up their game for the meeting with Manchester United at Wembley.“We now have six days to change our desire, our will to fight because, if we play a game like this in the FA\u0026nbspCup final we do not have a chance,” he said. “There was big frustration for me because I wanted to finish the season in the best possible way. Newcastle showed great desire and fight and outplayed us but we didn’t play a good game.”When asked whether the Cup final would represent his last game in charge of Chelsea he started laughing. “Do you think so, you have the news?” a smiling Conte inquired of his questioner before offering a riddle of a reply. “The club know very well the situation,” he said. “After Saturday we go on vacation, so we will see next\u0026nbspseason.”Rafael Benítez and Newcastle are\u0026nbspalso no strangers to playing politics\u0026nbspand the manager’s future here\u0026nbspis far from certain. But Benítez, as he continues contract negotiations with Mike Ashley, cannot have failed to be swayed by the choruses of “We want\u0026nbspyou to stay,” that echoed evocatively to the St James’ Park\u0026nbsprafters.“It was pretty much the perfect Sunday for me,” said the Spaniard, who will not extend a contract entering its final year unless he receives assurances as to transfer budget and infrastructure. With suitors circling things are at a delicate stage.“We’ve finished 10th,” Benítez said. “But 10th is not high enough for this club. The potential to do much better is there. We have to be sure we\u0026nbspshare the same ambitions. We need a squad\u0026nbspcapable of going anywhere and\u0026nbspwinning.”Ashley later said Benítez had his “full support” and added: “I will continue to ensure that every penny generated by the club is available to him. I hope very much that Rafa will remain at Newcastle United.”For protracted periods Newcastle looked as if they were the side pursuing Champions League qualification, piling so much pressure on their visitors that Chelsea frequently struggled to escape their own half.With the intensity of the home side ferocious and the decibel level ear-splitting, Conte’s team were in near total disarray with the lesser spotted Ross Barkley, making a rare start, struggling to get anywhere near the ball in midfield. Part of that was down to the fact that Shelvey, like Diamé, was irrepressible. Thibaut Courtois was swiftly required to repel Shelvey’s vicious long-range half-volley and Diamé’s angled shot.As Shelvey revelled in making N’Golo Kanté look thoroughly ordinary he appeared every inch an England international. The consensus is that Gareth Southgate has opted against including him in the World Cup squad he is due to name on Wednesday but Shelvey has not entirely abandoned hope of a summons. Maybe, just maybe, England’s manager still has a big decision to make.Newcastle’s playmaker helped create all three goals. The first originated with a pass that picked out the impressive Matt Ritchie, who confounded Conte’s defence with a left-foot cross from the right. When Jacob Murphy attempted somewhat audaciously to lob Courtois the goalkeeper palmed the ball clear – but only as far as Dwight Gayle, who headed into the unguarded\u0026nbspnet.As Conte appeared in danger of physical implosion Benítez remained an oasis of serenity, celebrating the goal by giving his glasses a polish before summoning his captain, Jamaal Lascelles, for a detailed tactical discussion.With only near misses from Shelvey and Pérez and another fine Courtois save to deny Gayle ensuring the scoreline remained 1-0, that homily seemed to have the desired effect.Although Eden Hazard belatedly began imposing a little of his talent on the second half, it was simply not Chelsea’s day. Despite a backpedalling Martin Dubravka performing acrobatic wonders to claw Olivier Giroud’s accomplished backheel to safety following Hazard’s cross, Newcastle responded by scoring a second.Again it was created by Shelvey, whose volleyed connection with a half-cleared cross would probably have flown past Courtois had Pérez not flicked out a boot to apply the final touch.After Dubravka excelled in keeping a Barkley effort out with his legs, Pérez soon scored his second. This time Shelvey whipped a free-kick in and Florian Lejeune’s slide-rule pass prefaced the Spaniard dispatching a shot past Courtois from six yards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ad5c04de5798edbfd74bc9bcccb191d4903bf55/0_133_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4072604a7b01ac9a0f5af1e37ad0bfd5","title":"arsene wenger final bow arsenal huddersfield town","story":"The final bow was a grand sweeping gesture, with the kind of flourish that would not look out of place on a Broadway stage. Arsène Wenger emerged for his last Premier League act, strode through a guard of honour, made a right turn towards the corner of Arsenal fans and when he arrived in front of them he bent that lean frame in acknowledgement of one hell of a story.Then he turned and skipped merrily back towards the dugout. Wenger is not renowned for his skipping. But everything feels different now. Fans who had not so\u0026nbsplong ago vocalised their discontent were eager to shower acclaim and gratitude. Wenger, who had been a picture of strain and stress until his leaving date was announced, looks as if the years have fallen from his face, the spring rejuvenating his step.The warmth of these past few weeks, as Wenger has gone on his farewell Premier League tour, has been so generous he joked that he should leave Arsenal more often. “I\u0026nbspshould have announced every week I retire,” he said. “People are so nice since I said that.”In time he will look back on the present from Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford, the golden Invincibles trophy to take home from his last home game, a rendition of “one Arsène Wenger” from both Burnley and Leicester supporters, and here the Huddersfield faithful offered their own memento: in the 22nd minute of the match the entire crowd rose to give Wenger an uplifting standing ovation. The man who tends to watch his games sitting felt moved to stand up and wave his appreciation. The way various corners of the English game have volunteered to add their applause is recognition of a football man but also reflects the way Wenger influenced the game in this country.A few yards down the sideline in the home dugout, David Wagner is adored in these parts for the renaissance he has inspired at Huddersfield Town. A foreign manager with big ideas, strong principles, and a willingess to throw himself into a new place and absorb its heart and soul – that idea is now strongly woven into the fabric of Premier League life.Wenger opened that door in 1996 for all others from around the globe to follow. By winning the Premier League in his first full season he gave credibility to the notion that an overseas manager can flourish in what had been an insular football environment, just beginning to broaden horizons. It felt fitting, somehow, that Wenger would bid his final farewell at the place where Herbert Chapman’s managerial status was born. Wenger noticed a big photograph of English football’s first great moderniser outside the dressing room. “He smiled at me,” the Frenchman said. “Herbert Chapman, maybe our greatest manager, came from here. So for me to come here had a special meaning.”Chapman, Arsenal’s original great innovator, built a team at Huddersfield which won the league three times in succession between 1924 and 1926 before moving to Highbury to repeat the feat in the early 1930s. He was a visionary of his time. A banner in the away end bore the message: “Thank you Herbert. Merci Arsène.”Football’s relentless schedule means Wenger does not like to dwell on history while he is conditioned into thinking about the next game, but for once he could. “I am very proud having contributed a little bit,” he said. “I don’t know what will stay or remain through the victories or defeats. I think what will remain is the formidable human aspect of the last 22 years – that is special and I will cherish that. I had fantastic human experiences at the club, above the results, it was a human adventure.”Exactly 1,235 matches ago Wenger picked an Arsenal team for the very first time. A side of nine Englishmen, one Welshman and a young Frenchman starting his third Premier League game by the name of Patrick Vieira, defeated Blackburn 2-0. Here at Huddersfield, Wenger’s final selection contained 11 different nationalities but signed off with an old-fashioned scoreline, the old George Graham favourite, one-nil to the Arsenal. Now, where did those 22 years go?Wenger’s long goodbye has been cathartic, with all the bad vibes evaporating in the late-season sunshine. It has ensured the love affair, as he describes it, did not peter out, or end with any recrimination. It has allowed him, and the Arsenal fans, to remember why they fell for each other in the first place.The bow was a impromptu show of emotion. “It was spontaneous,” Wenger said, “because I know that we’ve disappointed the away fans this season, that many of them they live the whole week and use their spare money to travel up to games. It’s part of the respect. We had disagreements which I accept but we had one thing in common: we loved Arsenal football club and I wanted to share that with them today.”The final whistle blew and it was over. All it needed was a soundtrack by Edith Piaf. He returned down the tunnel, pausing to give a thumbs up as he went. Over, and finally, respectfully and beautifully, Wenger\u0026nbspout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b3b0c787c7a3bcbed77fce1b2591d1ffadf00b/121_164_2997_1799/master/2997.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5895ceb904372062e2d21ffbc23f6134","title":"joan didion john dunne malibu writers food","story":"In her kitchen at home in Malibu, the writer liked an ice-cold Coke for breakfast – and making salads to feed 40 guestsThis kitchen is in the Malibu house where Didion lived for eight years with her husband John Dunne and daughter Quintana – it stood equidistant from Hollywood (where the two wrote films together) and the San Andreas Fault.Every morning, Dunne would rise, make a fire, give Quintana breakfast, and take her to school. “Then I would get up, have a Coca-Cola, and start work,” Didion remembers, in a recent documentary by her nephew, Griffin Dunne. The Coca-Colas were kept ice cold, and appear as essential to her writing routine as quiet and light. Those who pledged $50 or more to the crowdfunding of Griffin’s film received a copy of her personal cookbook. A scrapbook of food clippings from magazines, menus of the meals she served at dinner parties (for Patti Smith she made chicken hash with roasted yellow peppers and baguettes) and food-stained recipes, handwritten, with terse crossing-outs, its most revealing page was the recipe for a parsley salad, less as an illustration of her diet, or even for the way its sparse style reflects her prose, but more as an insight into her social reach: the salad feeds up to 40.It’s not just that her recipes reveal her – reading her work you see Didion discovers herself this way too. In the notes she scribbled when covering the Patty Hearst trial in 1976 she unpicks her privilege through memories of fancy meals, mid-flight, “Lunching Aloft on Beltsville Roast Turkey with Dressing and Giblet Sauce,” then, “Stuffed Celery au Roquefort over the Rockies”.Though she dwindled to 75 pounds, cooking seems to be for Didion, now 83, one of the rituals that helped her keep on living when everything (John died at the dinner table as she mixed a salad Quintana died two years later, at 39) had shattered around her. After Dunne’s death there was a period when all she ate was congee in the documentary she cuts the crusts off a cucumber sandwich while she reads from The Year of Magical Thinking, her report from the frontline of grief. Translating it into a play, David Hare took the opportunity to plump her up. He set up a table in the theatre, and a sign: Cafe Didion. Here he’d insist she ate, croissants and jam in the morning, sandwiches at lunch.It seems reductive to tie Didion so tightly to death, but it’s there even in her recipe book. From the parsley salad for 40, the quantities shrink as time passes, to 12, to 8, to the cucumber sandwich, for one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47da3cbab1a907411e9760f9fe308799cadd666c/2066_1633_1888_1133/master/1888.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=668b897a16a8717aabbfd07eb548c2ab","title":"mary holbrook goat cheese somerset tymsboro","story":"Mary Holbrook went from a PhD in archeology to becoming the Somerset small farmer who transformed British cheeseThere is a bit of a list of things that get Mary Holbrook’s goat: the government, Brexit, country fields full of solar panels, homogenous executive housing estates, people asking about pioneering cheesemaking and her hallowed place in British dairy history.Holbrook knows about history. She did a PhD in ancient history and archeology and, before cheese became her life, catalogued early scientific instruments in Hamburg in Germany and worked as a curator at a museum in Bath. Her husband, John, was a professor of biochemistry at Bristol University. She was never your typical cheesemaker, but for my money she is Britain’s best.John came from Somerset farming stock, and Sleight Farm, where she has more than 100 goats and 180 British Lop pigs, belonged to his family, but Holbrook was new to it. “I stopped working in museums because of red tape,” she laughs, “but dairy farming is much worse.” It was the mid-70s, she had two goats and two-and-half gallons of milk a day. “I asked myself, what am I going to do with it? Make some cheese. What am I going to do with that? Sell it.”There wasn’t much of a market for English goat’s cheese then so she sold locally through health-food shops. “My really crappy cheese did OK,” she says. “Then I went to France and came across their cheese moulds.”She wasn’t alone. French farmers were going through an artisan cheese revival and their influence was spreading.“They were all women,” says Neal’s Yard Dairy’s Randolph Hodgson, who was driving around the British Isles at the time looking for good cheese to sell. “There was Mary Holbrook at Sleight Farm, Veronica Steele at Milleens and Giana Ferguson at Gubbeen. They were a new wave and new to it. Mary had lived abroad and knew European cheeses and that is what she brought to it. She didn’t like following or leading a crowd. She is an independent spirit.”Also important was “Mr Taylor”, a former cheese buyer at Harrods. Holbrook had met him when she went into the food halls to check out her continental competition. She was soon supplying him. “I used to phone them in spring,” she says. “I’d speak to Mr Taylor and say, ‘I have cheese again.’ They were very good. He accepted it was seasonal. Now everyone wants it all year round. He was getting fresh cheese, the feta, our Little Rydings and Emlett. He took quite a range.”Emlett was my go-to cheese from when Holbrook also farmed sheep, until she suddenly sold her herd and it stopped, along with Sleight Farm’s Little Ryding. “Sheep need quite a lot of looking after, and they need shearing,” she says. “I couldn’t have been away from the farm if I had them.”Since around the time John died in 2002, Holbrook has spent a few days a week in Bethnal Green, east London. One week she’ll bring up cheese to Neal’s Yard Dairy in Bermondsey (“They get what I give them,” she says), the next she delivers her happily raised pigs and kids to restaurants such as Moro and James Lowe’s Lyle’s. Every Wednesday, she looks after her cheese at Neal’s Yard.Currently Holbrook makes four cheeses: young, fresh Sleightlett, Tymsboro, Cardo and Old Ford, a hard goat’s cheese, made when there’s enough milk and she’s inclined.“She is a one-off,” says Martin Gott who worked at Sleight Farm from 2004 to 2006. “What she has forgotten about cheese is more than most people will ever know. But she told me she was packing it up. She was spending a lot of time in London. She didn’t have anyone to milk her goats. It was all over, she said.”Gott and his partner, Nicola Robinson, moved from Cumbria to Somerset. “We shared the farmhouse and rented a couple of rooms. I thought, this lady isn’t going to be around for ever. I didn’t want to lose her take on cheese.”Gott also started developing his St James cheese at Holbrook’s dairy before taking it back to Cumbria. “We were working on the same farm, living in the same house, eating in the same kitchen, going about our own business.”It was the start of a second wind at Sleight Farm. “We were the first of a wave of people who worked with her,” he says. “Maybe she would have packed up, maybe other cheesemakers wouldn’t have come along after us. When you work with Mary, you see what farming should be. She sets the standard. It is a good academy.“She will work as hard as anyone you have ever met. She throws hay bales around. She is incredible. I call those memories my ‘Mary stories’. Like fairy stories they are unbelievable. She sets the bar really high and expects you to meet them. Don’t expect praise, but you know she is happy when she’s humming. Wandering around her farm, she hums quietly to herself. You can see when she is content. And seeing that is enough.”facebooksleightfarmtimsburyTymsboroHolbrook’s ash-coated pyramid. Firm, fresh, near dry white to soft, tangy, greeny-grey.CardoUses cardoon as a vegetable rennet.

It remains superb.Its streets are wide and nobly lined with mansions and offices that would flatter a capital. It has rich museums, universities, theatres and 50 dance halls. It has well-kept parks and a graceful river. This is a great city with a character as strong and pleasing as its national drink.But it is also a city that considers itself in trouble. It believes itself to be in the grip of a crime wave, not so much of robbery as of a degenerate, mindless, pointless violence. This week, for example, a 16-year-old boy, who could not run away because he had an artificial leg, was stabbed three times by young strangers in a park. They ran away, shouting “Shamrock”. A 12-year-old boy, the son of a policeman, waiting at a bus stop, was slashed down his jaw-line with a razor. And again there was no reason for an attack that was as casual as a smile at a pretty girl. A girl looking into a shop window with friends was stabbed in the back, apparently because she had refused to kiss a strange young man.The worst of Glasgow’s recent experiences came over the Easter weekend. Then there were 21 serious assaults and 25 robberies with violence. Nearly 100 people were injured. A boy coming home from church on Good Friday was stabbed by a youthful gang and died on the pavement in his father’s arms. There were 132 brutal attacks in Glasgow in March. There were 56 in the same time a year ago.It is a mysterious business and it is not clear if the situation is worse than in other comparable cities. Violence and its punishment was a major issue in the recent local elections and the Tories first and then the Labour candidates made it one of their chief claims to authority. There are demands for sterner punishments and for more powers of search and arrest for the police, though they would seem to have all that a civilised policeman could require.There were famous fights in the 1920s and 30s when gangs of up to 300 fought each other on the streets. Now Lord Carmont, a judge who handed down punishment like an outraged god, is remembered with longing. He is accorded the honour of having diminished razor slashing. The knife has taken its place and the convenient broken bottle remains.Extract from an article, published in the Observer on 19 May 1968, entitled ‘Where the violence is as casual as the smile of a pretty girl’, by Patrick O’Donovan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eb0ef668d02e0fc036bc4055a6e0fe151c1f162/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e247479ac6019772d8f64c13682c129","title":"2018 festival anthems","story":"What makes a banging festival anthem, besides a simple chorus that vast crowds can belt out in unison? Here are the tracks you can expect to hear all summerIn 1970, a band called Fairfield Parlour were commissioned to write a “theme tune” for the Isle of Wight festival. They obligingly changed their name to I Luv Wight and devised a charming bit of psych whimsy called Let the World Wash In. The event itself went down in history: the crowd was bigger than at Woodstock, and Jimi Hendrix’s headlining performance turned out to be one of his last. But Let the World Wash In did not: according to legend, the festival DJ played it once, then publicly smashed the record in front of a cheering crowd.It was early evidence that festival anthems are difficult, nebulous things to define. The question of what makes one is as thorny as the hedgerow you find yourself falling into at 3am, while simultaneously trying to urinate alfresco. If there were a formula to it, everyone would knock one out each summer. But clearly there isn’t. If you Google “festival anthem” what you swiftly learn is that if an artist proudly announces they’ve written a festival anthem, it’s Let the World Wash In all over again vanishing into obscurity.Perhaps there are too many variables in a festival to predict entirely accurately what is going to go down well: what sounds life-affirming on a blissfully hot afternoon may well make people want to murder you if they’ve spent the previous 48 hours wading through slurry with carrier bags tied around their feet. The solitary rule is that you want a chorus simplistic enough for vast crowds to be able to bellow along in unison, which is why, whatever their merits as songs, Bon Iver’s 29 #Strafford APTS is never likely to become a festival anthem, but Coldplay’s Fix You has. Indeed, the popularity of 2017’s most ubiquitous festival anthem – the repurposing of the White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army that we may as well call Oh, Jeremy Corbyn – had something to do with a spirit of optimism engendered by the man. But it was doubtless linked to the fact everyone could remember the words to it, even after three days subsisting entirely on a diet of warm cider and chewing gum. That said, this year, any of the following might well be in with a fighting chance … APAny track off last year’s CTRL album would work in an early evening, sun-dappled festival slot, but Drew Barrymore wins because it comes with a perfect in-built checklist of necessities. “Bring the gin, got the juice, bring the sin, got that too,” she sings, while “somebody get the tacos, somebody spark the blunt” is the exact level of slightly-too-aggressive organisational ability any large group of friends needs.Lovebox, LongitudeSelf-proclaimed “best boyband since One Direction”, 14-strong US hip-hop collective Brockhampton’s stage attire is basically the Smurfs doing work experience at the Arches, all blue body paint and overalls. Mix in some proper head-rattling bangers – of which the unfeasibly energetic Boogie is the best example – and you have future festival headliners in the making.Reading \u0026amp LeedsIn theory, Finders Keepers’ double-time handclaps (a sample of Lenky’s Diwali Riddim) are perfect for uncomplicated choreography. All you do is put both hands in the air, slap them against each other and before you know it you’re part of a glorious united moment. Be warned, though: quickly you’ll realise it’s going that bit too fast, that fifth vodka and orange isn’t settling too well with the chicken wrap and actually you need a lie down.Parklife, Wireless, Lovebox, Longitude, Field DayIf, like Noel Gallagher, you miss the sound of “proper instruments”, ie guitars, at festivals then fear not because lanky Canadian teenager Shawn Mendes is here to save the day. In My Blood is basically Kings of Leon’s Use Somebody spliced with the harder-edged sound of 1D’s Story of My Life, and the perfect, hormone-fuelled soundtrack to a fast-tracked festival relationship of sloppy snogs and tearful arguments.Sundown festival, Fusion festivalDon’t Kill My Vibe may have got her on all the Big in 2018 lists, but it was this fat-free electropop belter that broke the Top 10.

Lauren Zhang, who lives and studies in Birmingham, competed against 18-year-old saxophonist Robert Burton and 18-year-old cellist Maxim Calver to win the title in the 40th year of the competition. She performed Prokofiev’s 2nd Piano Concerto in G minor, op.16 with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mark Wigglesworth. The judges praised her performance of a hugely challenging and ambitious work: “Her exceptional level of technical skill and intelligent musicality shone through in a beast of a piece,” said Kerry Andrew, chair of the judging panel. “She has a natural genuine musicianship... and a real intelligence,” said violinist and previous winner Nicola Benedetti.Lauren said: “I’m astonished ... I can’t quite believe it! It’s been a fantastic opportunity to play with the CBSO and the journey right from the start of the competition has been incredible.”Lauren is currently studying for her GCSEs at King Edward VI High School for Girls – she has three exams on Tuesday – and also attends the Birmingham Junior Conservatoire. She began learning the piano at the age of four and also plays the violin. Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Lauren and her family moved to Birmingham in 2010. At the Junior Conservatoire she is taught by Dr Robert Markham, who himself was a finalist in the BBC Young Musician competition in 1986.Principal of the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire Professor Julian Lloyd Webber said: “Having spent a lifetime making music with some of the world’s finest musicians I can honestly say that Lauren is up there with the best – she is a total phenomenon.”Judging the competition alongside Andrew were conductor Alpesh Chauhan, cellist Natalie Clein, saxophonist John Harle and pianist Sunwook Kim. Also at Birmingham’s Symphony Hall to hand over the trophy, and perform himself for the audience while the judges conferred, was 2016’s winner Sheku Kanneh-Mason.

Afterwards, he said: “This money has sat idly for nearly a century, accumulating in value but contributing nothing to either the national debt or good causes. This money would help charities feed the hungry, house the homeless and care for the sick, as well as supporting other worthy causes.”The delay has ensured that the fund’s coffers have swollen further, from just below £250m in 2009 to £475m, according to the last set of accounts. But the Charity Commission believes that any charity in which “funds appear to be held indefinitely is problematic” and that “the matter of the National Fund has therefore been of concern to us”.The idea that citizens had the will or wherewithal to pay off such vast sums was always optimistic. Nevertheless, it was not for 80 years that the idea of closing the National Fund and donating the proceeds to good causes was mooted.That proposal originally came from its trustees, now represented by Zedra Financial Services. But the National Fund’s most recent accounts say that is not the most likely outcome: that would instead see the endowment “liquidated and payment made to the National Debt commissioners”, which is part of the Treasury.Jeremy Wright, the attorney general, told Reed in a written response this week that he accepted there was no realistic prospect of the fund ever paying off the national debt. He added that “the intentions and wishes of the person who originally set up the fund ... must be respected” and promised to update MPs shortly on what he would do next.To release the funds and close the trust that governs the fund, Wright would have to apply to the courts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8913141b2f5b2d9643aa3a44edd2574734fafcd0/0_212_4272_2564/master/4272.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e01160921a7cea547e66895c6425225e","title":"michael gove irish border technology brexit","story":"Criticism of May’s preferred model brings cabinet customs union breakthrough into questionMichael Gove has cast fresh doubt on the possibility of a breakthrough in the cabinet customs deadlock, saying there were “significant question marks” about proposals for a customs partnership.The environment secretary expressed scepticism about the merits of Theresa May’s preferred customs partnership model, saying the proposal had flaws and needed to be tested.Gove indicated he had some sympathy for the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who called the proposal “crazy” this week.“Because it’s novel, because no model like this exists there have to be significant questions about the deliverability of it on time,” Gove told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.Brexiters prefer an alternative model, the so-called “max fac”, which uses technology to do customs checks with limited friction on the Northern Irish border.Gove admitted cabinet ministers remained conflicted about both proposals, saying “there is agreement that neither of these two models is absolutely perfect”.The cabinet’s Brexit subcommittee will meet again on Tuesday but is not expected to emerge with a compromise. A government source suggested the two working groups of cabinet ministers, set up last week to thrash out arguments for both proposals, needed to be given time to work through the two options.Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, expressed some frustration with the deadlock and the counter-briefings. Asked if he was one of the ministers threatening to block the new customs partnership, which appeared to be the prime minister’s preferred model, he said: “I’m backing the prime minister. I think that we have to trust Theresa May.”“You can’t iron out every single detail of a negotiating position in public,” he told LBC. “It’s going to be bumpy of course because it’s a different course to the way we were going to go but we’ve got to have some confidence and trust in her.”The former cabinet minister Stephen Crabb also said MPs were becoming increasingly disturbed by the deadlock. “I am not alone in saying there is a growing concern on the backbenches about how entrenched some of the positions in the cabinet seem to have become,” he told the BBC. “The vast majority of Conservative MPs don’t see this question of a customs union as some kind of ideological cage fight.”He added that cabinet ministers who refused to budge may find that “parliament will be making the decisions for them”.Under the customs partnership model, the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU and its backers believe it would go some way to solving the issue with the Northern Irish border.Brexiters prefer the “maximum facilitation” model that relies on technology to minimise border checks, which critics say cannot resolve the Irish border issue and would require lengthy development of sophisticated new technology.On Sunday, Gove said he would not back any delay to the UK leaving the customs union beyond the transition period to allow new border technology to be developed.“In delay there lies no plenty,” he said. “The critical thing is to meet that deadline. My experience in government reinforces my belief that we need to make sure we deliver things at pace.”EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.Ireland’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said there had been a clear commitment from May that there would be no border infrastructure. He said any backtracking would mean “a very difficult summer for these negotiations if that happens”. Though the EU has been widely reported to have rejected both of May’s customs options, Coveney indicated a softening of approach to the customs partnership, saying he was open to a solution “as long as it achieves the outcome of there being no physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland and no related checks or controls”.Coveney said the Irish government “don’t take our lead from Boris Johnson in relation to Brexit. We take our lead from the prime minister. She has signed up to very clear commitments.”Johnson has been excluded from the two working groups examining the merits of both options, as has the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who is most in favour of the customs partnership.Gove will examine the customs partnership alongside Liam Fox and David Lidington, while David Davis will examine the “max fac” model with Karen Bradley and Greg Clark, who have expressed scepticism about that model’s negative effects on business and on its workability at the Northern Irish border."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96a5e7bf3177fc2aa27a487dabca9fe88a531225/69_0_568_341/master/568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ff73e0f9ce5aab3d63735600b156a05","title":"starwatch evening star venus new moon jupiter","story":"Another lunar cycle begins on Thursday as the thin crescent moon shares the evening sky with glittering VenusThere is a beautiful sight to keep an eye open for after sunset on 17 May.

Graham Onions, who played the last of his nine Tests in 2012, claimed six wickets in the second innings and nine in the match, while the incumbent Jimmy Anderson ably backed him up with four wickets in the second and six overall.This was Lancashire’s first win in five this season, and they gained revenge for an opening‑round defeat against Nottinghamshire at Old Trafford last month. The hosts started day three on 106 for five having conceded a first-innings lead of 205. They were bowled out for just 138. Onions, a 35-year-old new signing for the Red Rose, is now nine wickets away from 650 career first-class scalps. .There was another victory of note at New Road, where the champions Essex came from behind to beat Worcestershire, who fell 33 short of a 215 target. Essex bounced back from losing their first Championship match in 19 against Yorkshire at Chelmsford last weekend, with the off-spinner Simon Harmer and the Australian overseas seamer Peter Siddle equally sharing the second‑innings wickets. The bottom side Worcestershire had been 50 for one and 160 for five in their pursuit.Yorkshire’s captain Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow are under pressure against Surrey at the Oval, with the visitors made to follow-on 185 runs behind midway through the afternoon. Unfortunately for Root, he fell twice in the day for 14 and 23, trapped lbw by on-song Sam Curran and bowled through the gate by the fledgling off-spinner Amar Virdi. Bairstow, however, enjoyed a more productive day. He counter-attacked for 95 off 94 balls, passing 6,000 career Championship runs on the way, and finished the day unbeaten on 25 second time around. Yorkshire closed on 142 for five, 43 behind. Curran, 19, finished with six for 54 in the first innings and was awarded his first-team cap at lunch. Warwickshire strengthened their grip on top spot in Division Two with a six-wicket win against Northamptonshire at Edgbaston, their third from four matches. Chasing a 180 target, they were 94 for four, but the opener Will Rhodes posted 100 not out. Kent replaced Sussex in second place by comfortably defending a 270 target at Canterbury. The New Zealand seamer Matt Henry finished with six wickets and 10 in the match to take his tally to 37 in four Championship outings this summer.At Grace Road, Leicestershire claimed a nail-biting three-run win over Glamorgan, who recovered from 139 for eight chasing 251. Marchant de Lange smashed 90 off 45 balls to heighten nerves, but the Foxes held on for only a third Championship win since 2012. Middlesex are chasing an innings victory over Gloucestershire, who started their second 245 behind at Lord’s and closed on 66 for two. Derbyshire and Durham are heading for a high-scoring draw at Derby.Out came the sun and out went the demons from the Taunton pitch. At last the batsmen could look down at the strip of fast-fading green turf and they felt that they could trust it. There was minimal lateral movement and just a hint of swing under a cloudless sky, and the ball would not turn for the spinners in a match that has been dominated so far by Somerset.The hosts, who contrived 506 after being 134 for five, raced away in the morning with James Hildreth purring along with the tail. In fact it might be regarded as a fake tail. After the early departure of Jack Leach, leaving a ball from Fidel Edwards and losing his off-stump, Dom Bess demonstrated that he is an imposter at No 10.In 30 overs the irrepressible Bess added 145 with Hildreth. He dominated the strike and the scoring as the Hampshire attack, deprived of Kyle Abbott again, began to wilt. Bess scores in similar areas to Hildreth, square of the wicket, and he is just as rapid stealing singles. He adds buzz to whatever he is doing on a cricket field, which will not include batting at No 10 for much longer.Only Hildreth’s final shot was ugly. Before lunch on 184 he mishit a high full toss from Tom Alsop to mid‑on. After the break Tim ­Groenewald swung merrily but Bess, on 92, was denied his first century for Somerset by a fine delivery from Gareth Berg.Batting was a more serious business when Hampshire began their second innings with a deficit of 275. The tempo declined but the skill level did not. Somerset’s attack snatched two early wickets via errors from Jimmy Adams, swishing outside his off-stump, and Joe Weatherley, who pulled a ball straight into the hand of George Bartlett, meticulously placed at deep square leg seconds earlier.Now the quality stepped up. As Somerset, sniffing their third victory of the season, probed, Hampshire’s two Test batsmen, James Vince and Hashim Amla, set to work. Vince, on eight, offered a tough chance to Craig Overton in the gully but he then proceeded to bat with great composure and skill. And patience, which is a quality more readily associated with Amla, who gave the connoisseurs a treat. The Somerset bowlers made him work hard but Amla is humble enough to do that. By the close he had cruised to an unbeaten 86 while Vince had, by his standards, crawled to an excellent 63. Hence there is a way out for Hampshire, who are now just 97 runs behind. Squeaky bum time at New Road. Worcestershire are seven down for 170, needing 45 more to beat Essex. Simon Harmer has done the most recent damage with three wickets. But in Travis Head, unbeaten on 55, and captain Joe Leach, they still have men capable of getting them home. To colleagues in the press box here at the Oval, I have just predicted the loss of Leach in the not too distant future and Head attacking as he runs out of partners to see them home. Adam Lyth has just fallen caught at slip off Amar Virdi for 58. Yorkshire 99-4.Joe Root has been bowled through the gate by off-spinner Amar Virdi for 23, leaving Yorkshire at 663 in the 29th over. We still have 28 overs left to be bowled in the day. It is fair to say Virdi was pretty chuffed with that. If you want to imagine his celebration, think a cross between Monty Panesar and Imran Tahir.Worcestershire, having been 97-5 in pursuit of 215 to beat Essex at New Road, are now 140-5 as Australia’s Travis Head and Ed Barnard steady they ship. They have 38 and 26 respectively. 75 more for a first win of the season for the Pears. We have our second result of the round, and it’s at Edgbaston, where Division Two leaders Warwickshire have beaten Northamptonshire by six wickets. It is their third win from four matches this summer. Here at the Oval, Yorkshire are 24-2. We still have 40 overs to bowl. At tea Hampshire are 70-2. The cricket has been sedate but of high quality. Vince and Amla have played watchfully as the situation demands Somerset’s England bowlers have been on target. Overton bowled much better than in the first innings Leach was also accurate but extracted little turn. We are therefore in connoisseur country in lazy Sunday afternoon sunshine. For the first time at Taunton this summer the bowlers are going to have to toil for their wickets but Hampshire will also have to work very hard to avoid defeat here. Like many others around the country this is a good game.The champions are fighting hard. Worcestershire are now 68-4 and still 147 away from their target against Essex at New Road, with Peter Siddle doing the early damage with three wickets, including that of Joe Clarke lbw for two. In Division Two, Sussex are 88-4 chasing 270 against Kent at Canterbury. Matt Henry has two, with everything he touches turning to gold at present. Warwickshire are on the verge of beating Northamptonshire. They are 23 away with six wickets in hand. Here at The Oval, Yorkshire are 15-2 in their second innings. Joe Root has two of them, a dab wide of slips.Yorkshire’s batting troubles continue. They are 10-2 in their second innings. Jade Dernbach and Sam Curran have removed Alex Lees (caught at second slip) and Che Pujara (bowled off an inside edge) to bring captain Joe Root to the crease. Whatever they do, the White Rose county can’t seem to get going with the bat. It’s a long standing problem and one that has left coaches and players scratching their heads. The pitch has flattened here but Somerset have a second wicket, one that Joe Weatherley will want to erase from his memory. Not much was happening against tight bowling especially from Tim Groenewald. Then Abell and Groenewald decided to send George Bartlett towards the square leg boundary. With great precision Bartlett was stationed about 15 yards inside the rope and next ball Groenewald, who has never been a speedster (except when holding the bat) dug the ball in. Weatherley pulled and Bartlett did not have to move an inch to take the catch. So now Hampshire’s key batsmen, Vince and Amla, are together. 48-2Yorkshire are all out for 229 and will follow-on, 185 runs behind. We still have 57 overs left in the day, not taking into account a possible extra half hour. Sorry to be pessimistic, Yorkshire fans. Sam Curran has finished with six wickets and has just taken his 100th in first-class cricket, the fourth youngest Surrey player to achieve that feat. He turns 20 in June.Adams has played a loose swish outside the off-stump and has been caught behind off Gregory. So Vince is at the crease early. I wonder whether what he does here will influence the selectors, who announce the Test squad on Tuesday or have they already reached their conclusions? Of those on the outside Clarke, Gubbins, Jennings, Burns and Foakes have all scored recent runs - and so has Hildreth. Vince has hit one delicious shot to the boundary. I leave you to ponder what it was. 24-1Jonny Bairstow has just fallen for 95 to Jade Dernbach, caught at first slip by Rikki Clarke on the drive. Yorkshire are 203-9, with Surrey set to choose whether to bat again. I wouldn’t, not in a million years.Worcestershire are chasing 215 at New Road as they bid to inflict a second successive defeat upon champions Essex. They hadn’t lost in 19 before last week’s heist by Yorkshire at Chelmsford. The hosts are currently 11-0. Here, Jonny Bairstow is in the early nineties (93 to be precise), with Yorkshire 197-8. They need 68 more to avoid the follow-on.Somerset all out for 506. Bess was bowled by a trimmer from Berg for 94, Groenewald, one of the better No 11s on the circuit, hit 25 in no time. So the lead is 275. Now we wait to see whether fresh bowlers can find life in a pitch that is now pale green. We are taking lunch here, slightly late given there are 104 overs to be bowled in the day. Yorkshire are 176-7 with Jonny Bairstow unbeaten on 87. Five-wicket star Sam Curran was capped as the players left the field. It looks an absolute corker at New Road, where Essex are 266-8 at lunch, leading Worcestershire by 205. You wait ages for one defeat and then two come along once. Potentially, I stress, for the champions.We have one result in around the circuit, with Lancashire beating leaders Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. Former Durham pair Graham Onions and Keaton Jennings were their stars with nine wickets in the match and a century respectively.Speaking of Durham, in Division Two, they are 217-5 in reply to Derbyshire’s 417 at the County Ground. Graham Clark has top-scored so far with 63, but he’s out. Leaders Warwickshire are wobbling at 44-3 chasing 179 against Northamptonshire at Edgbaston – Ben Sanderson with all three wickets. Sussex will chase 270 to beat Kent at Canterbury, with that pursuit just about to start. Like at New Road, that looks a belter of a finish. The same at Grace Road, where Leicestershire are 191-7, leading Glamorgan by 204. At Lord’s, Gloucestershire at 107-3 replying to Middlesex’s 4558 declared.It’s been a romp for Somerset in an elongated session. Hildreth and Dom Bess, an imposter at No 10, added 145 together as the pitch ran out of malice and the Hampshire bowlers – with the exception of Fidel Edwards who kept steaming in to no great effect – ran out of puff. At lunch Somerset sit pretty on 472-9, a lead of 241.Hildreth has been the more measured of the two. He knows how to capitalise. This was the 15th time he had passed 150 out of his 43 hundreds. Then in the last over before lunch on 184 he mishit a high full toss from Tom Alsop, a very occasional left-armer, to mid-on. How fortunate for Somerset that they are unlikely to be deprived of Hildreth’s services once the Tests start, how unjust that he has never played a match for England, though he represented the Lions on a regular basis a few years ago. His self-deprecating manner may not have endeared him to the men that matter, I suppose.We know the powers that be like the buzz and business of Bess, who will surely not bat in double figures again for Somerset. He has a first class hundred to his name for the MCC against Essex in Barbados in March. At lunch he was unbeaten on 84 and he may have the chance top register his first one for Somerset after the break.With the sun out the demons seem to have departed so we expect plenty from Bess and Leach with the ball before long.Yorkshire have lost two more quickly, Jack Leaning for 20 lbw to Rikki Clarke and Tim Bresnan caught at second slip off Sam Curran for one, to slip to 158-7, still 107 runs away from the follow-on target. Curran has five wickets, and Jonny Bairstow is still there on 76. Warwickshire are 21-1 chasing 179 against Northamptonshire, while Kent have lost three morning wickets and are 198-7 against Sussex at Canterbury, leading by 232. Glamorgan are turning things around at Grace Road and have taken five this morning, with Leicestershire 158-7 and leading by 171. Michael Hogan has four-for. Here, Jonny ploughs on, although helped by a missed opportunity from Jade Dernbach (one-handed to his right) off his own bowling on 66. He has 74 of 154-5. Yorkshire need to reach 265 to avoid the follow-on.Jonny Bairstow reaches 50 off 46 balls with 10 fours, his second successive fifty after last week’s effort against the new ball in the second innings at Chelmsford. Is he England’s best batsman right now? Anyway, Yorkshire are 131-5. And Lancashire have won by an innings and 67 at Trent Bridge, bowling Notts out for 138 in their second innings. 6-55 for Onions and 4-26 for Anderson. That is Lancashire’s first away win in the Championship since July 2015 against Glamorgan at Colwyn Bay when Ashwell Prince and Alviro Petersen put on 501 for the fourth wicket - also an innings win.Lancashire are on the verge of their first win, with Nottinghamshire having lost three morning wickets to slip to 127-8. They are still 78 runs in arrears, with Graham Onions completing a five-for. He has shared all eight to fall with new ball partner Jimmy Anderson, who has most recently trapped Luke Fletcher lbw for nought.Greetings from Taunton, where Somerset are attacking the second new ball – there haven’t been many of those unwrapped here this season. Jack Leach lost his off stump to the old ball, not playing a shot. Obviously he was trying to play too responsibly. Against the new one the runs have flowed. Hildreth purrs on and Dom Bess is not really a number ten. In fact the names of Somerset’s batsmen from 7-10 (mind you Groenewald at 11 is not so bad) could be put into a hat to sort out the order. Just enjoyed a magnificent slice of coffee and walnut cake produced, if not cooked, by our press box doyen and host, Richard Walsh. What a fine start to the day.I mentioned in the scene-setter that Doug Bracewell had to back up his first-innings 81 to give Northamptonshire a realistic chance of victory over Warwickshire at Edgbaston. Well, he’s gone for seven, caught behind off Olly Stone. Northants are 1798, leading by 170. Here, Yorkshire are five down having lost Harry Brook, caught behind off Sam Curran for 17. They are 865, and Jonny Bairstow has 33 of them in typically pugnacious fashion.Joe Root has gone to the day’s sixth ball from Sam Curran. He’s been trapped lbw playing around his front pad for 14 having faced the second half of the over. Jonny Bairstow joins Harry Brook at the crease, and Yorkshire are 414. Saturday was a day for two centurions who are very much in the category of England hopefuls Keaton Jennings for Lancashire against Nottinghamshire and Joe Clarke for Worcestershire against Essex. On Sunday, the current Test captain will hope to match them as Yorkshire bid to stave off a Surrey charge towards victory here.Joe Root will begin day three unbeaten on 14 with his side at 403 in reply to Surrey’s 414. Jonny Bairstow is still to come as well, and the White Rose will need them both to perform. The general consensus is that this is a new ball pitch, so the first hour or so will be very interesting.Both Jennings and Clarke, Lions team-mates, scored their second successive centuries. Jennings helped put Lancashire in control at Trent Bridge, with Notts 1065 in their second innings and still 99 runs behind. That one could easily be done by lunch. It would not be a great surprise to see the left-hander named in Ed Smith’s first Test squad later this week. Clarke’s inclusion, surely ahead of James Vince if anything, would be a touch more left field. But why not?His Worcester side just about have the edge against Essex, who will resume day three on 1434 in their second innings with a lead of 82. Alastair Cook was out for 66 late on last night.James Hildreth will resume unbeaten on 125 for Somerset (3247) against Hampshire (231) at Taunton. England chance passed him by? Probably, yes, although many will put him in the unlucky bracket.In Division Two, like here at the Oval where rain damaged day two, they will get under way at Lord’s between Middlesex and Gloucestershire. The hosts declared on 4558 before rain arrived at lunch. Leicestershire (191 and 1192) are on top against Glamorgan (178) at Grace Road with a lead of 132, as are Kent (215 and 1254) against Sussex (181) at Canterbury. They lead by 159. The draw looks favourite between Derbyshire (427) and Durham (1152) at the County Ground.And finally, Division Two pacesetters Warwickshire are on course to win again, with Northamptonshire struggling at Edgbaston. They are 1607 in their second innings with a lead of 151. New Zealand all-rounder Doug Bracewell is at the crease. If he can match his first-innings 81, they could be in business.

Whether you fancy paddleboarding around the coast or zipwiring across the treetops, here’s how to unlock a healthier, happier you this spring and summerFrom reducing blood pressure to alleviating symptoms of depression, countless studies have proved that being outdoors and in contact with nature is beneficial for both physical and mental health. In these milder months, there’s no excuse not to be outside as much as possible. Here are nine ideas for inspiration.Ride a waveThe north Cornwall coast, with its big Atlantic seas, is Britain’s premier surf destination, with Fistral beach at Newquay probably the country’s best-known surf beach. But there are great places to learn to surf all around the UK. If you’re after a board experience with a less steep learning curve, stand-up paddleboarding offers the chance to take to the water in an easy-to-learn fashion. As well as the exhilaration of surfing the waves, paddleboarding can be a means of exploring the wonders of Britain’s tranquil inland waterways.Get started: Surfing England (surfingengland.org) has information on surf clubs and learning to surf. The British Stand Up Paddle Association website (bsupa.org.uk) has information on where to learn.See colours in bloomSpring and summer are the best times to explore England’s most glorious gardens. Among the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) stunners is its flagship garden, Wisley in Surrey. Home to one of the world’s largest plant collections, it’s a riot of flowering bulbs and blossoms in spring, with fragrant roses and colourful mixed borders in summer. The RHS also runs summer flower shows around the country, including the world-famous Chelsea flower show. The National Trust is  to more than 200 gardens and landscaped parks, many attached to its historic houses, with Studley Royal water gardens at Fountains Abbey, also a world heritage site, among the best known.Freewheel through forest trailsZip along peaceful country lanes between summer hedgerows, pedal past glowering mountains above Scotland’s Glencoe pass as part of a tour or expedition, race with other cyclists, or even head off-road along forest trails on a mountain bike. Cycling can provide high-adrenaline sport or light, relaxing exercise, but whichever way you ride, getting on a bike gives you an up-close view of the countryside that you’d never get from a car.Get started: Cycling UK (cyclinguk.org) can help you get on the road, with advice on everything from buying a bike to cycling groups and routes.Escape to the countryCity dwellers craving a rural fix should seek out one of the many regional annual outdoor shows, a celebration of farming and rural life, with sheep and cattle competitions, horse and dog shows, sheep-shearing contests and farm machinery displays. These days, though, the events are also packed with family-friendly entertainments, ranging from air displays and carriage-driving races to skateboarding and marching bands. Local producers showcase their food and drink, and makers display arts and crafts.Get started:UK County Shows (ukcountyshows) has countrywide information and links to inidual shows.Swim in scenic surroundingsWhat could be a more perfect summer idyll than plunging into a cool lake or river on a hot, sunny day? Wild swimming – taking a dip in rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls – has a growing number of fans. Popular spots to swim include Ullswater in the Lake District and lochs throughout Scotland, while rivers in the Brecon Beacons are home to stunning waterfall plunge pools. In the south of England, Pangbourne on the river Thames is one of many popular locations, and there are even urban swims to be had in London’s Serpentine and Highgate ponds.Get started: There’s information on locations throughout the UK and all-important safety tips tips at wildswimming.Soar into the treetopsThere’s a special kind of thrill to hurtling through the treetops suspended on a wire. Locations range from urban parks (such as Heaton Park in Manchester and Battersea Park in London) to mountains and forests. Zip World, with locations in Wales, offers a variety of adventures through forest, over a quarry and even – this one’s for the fitter and more adventurous – underground in caverns. Go Ape has locations throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and a collection of mainly forest-based attractions.Kayak along the waterwaysBritain has thousands of miles of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals canoeing (single-ended paddle), or kayaking (double-ended paddle), is a great way to explore them. Assuming you don’t have your own canoe, you’ll need to join a club or go to an activity centre, where staff will generally help new paddlers with an induction session. Sea kayaking is a lot of fun, too, and more experienced paddlers may enjoy canoe polo (just as it sounds) or white-water canoeing. Get started: British Canoeing (britishcanoeing.org.uk) has information on canoe clubs and activity centres around the country, and on canoe hire.Walk this wayWhether it’s a Sunday stroll or a serious hike, there’s no simpler – or cheaper – way to explore Britain’s great outdoors than on foot. The British countryside is laced with public footpaths all you need to get going is a pair of walking boots or sturdy trainers (plus a map and weatherproof gear if you’re going far). Among myriad footpaths, 16 national trails pass through some of the country’s most iconic landscapes. They include the South West Coast Path, with 630 miles of trails snaking around the Dorset, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset coasts, and northern England’s hilly Pennine Way.Get started: National Trails (nationaltrail). In addition, Ramblers (ramblers.org.uk) has suggestions for hiking routes on its website.Combine your love of music with the outdoorsPack your tent and wellington boots and head for one of the country’s iconic music festivals this summer. These days the biggest international names (from Beyoncé to Ed Sheeran) vie to play them: there’s no other way to see so many top artists in a single location. Glastonbury is taking a break in 2018, but there are many others picking up the slack, from Bestival to Latitude, the Isle of Wight festival, V and many more.

Whatever the weather this summer, Shakespeare comedy As You Like It lends itself so well to the enchanting backdrop you’ll feel like you’re in the mythical Forest of Arden itself. Sit back and immerse yourself in an evening of love, laughter and classic lines like, “All the world’s a stage.” And the dreamy musical score – comprising brand new tunes from former Noah and the Whale frontman Charlie Fink – isn’t bad either.openairtheatre 06-28 JulyHead to the hottest art showWhat could be better than an exhibition of work from one of the 20th century’s greatest artists? A good nosy at their previously unseen personal possessions and artefacts, that’s what. This summer, that’s exactly what London’s V\u0026ampA museum delivers in the much-anticipated Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up. The majority of this collection of jewellery, letters, photographs and items from her wardrobe (including hand-painted corsets) was only recently discovered, having been shut away for 50 years since her death. Consider this essential for demystifying the Mexican artist and sartorial icon, and it’s a lot cheaper than going all the way to Mexico. Granted, the exhibition is indoors, but you can combine your visit with a stop-off at the V\u0026ampA’s garden cafe, a hidden oasis in the centre of the museum, where you can sit at one of the courtyard tables or picnic on the lawn.vam.ac.uk from 16 JuneArrange a bouquet of flowersYou don’t have to be embarking on a second career as a florist to appreciate a beautifully arranged bunch of flowers, although a workshop at The Narcissus Flower School in Edinburgh could well send you in that direction. From learning to hand-tie a spring wedding bouquet to perfecting a festival-ready floral crown, this is the place to go this summer for cutting-edge botanical design. The highlight in the programme has to be The Foragers Garden Party workshop, which caters to all al fresco needs, from rustic barbecues to afternoon tea. Bring it on.narcissusflowers 21 June (and various dates)Learn a new craftStep away from the sandy beaches and seafood and head straight to The Studio at Burlingham Hall in Norfolk to get your hands – rather than your toes – dirty this summer. Artist Victoria Hall runs a two-day workshop for beginners in the art of paper marbling at this picturesque country estate. You’ll learn about the history, get familiar with watercolours, and tackle various paper patterns (including curl and comb designs). In fact, you’ll have a range of eclectic designs under your belt by the end. And if you don’t leave feeling like a born-again artist, you’ll certainly have the materials to make some pretty alternative Christmas cards.burlinghamhall 16-17 AugustGo down to the woodsHead to the Latitude festival for late-night poetry, light installations, and the biggest comedy, theatre, and arts line up in its 12-year history. Held in Suffolk’s picturesque Henham Park, Latitude is renowned for its eclectic arts programme, with a bit of yoga and lake swimming thrown in for good measure. This year it’s all about Bridget Christie and Tim Key in the comedy selection, while the Killers and Alt-J are definitely headliners to be reckoned with. But it’s the addition of enigmatic music and fashion icon Solange to the bill – her first time heading up a UK festival – that’ll be a real feast of the senses.latitudefestival 12-15 JulyFill up at a foodie festivalIs your idea of heaven on a hot day hitting up a beer garden? Then Pub in the Park is for you. Launched last summer by chef Tom Kerridge to celebrate great British chefs, pubs and music, this year sees the festival go on tour. There are four locations – Higginson Park in Marlow, Royal Victoria Park in Bath, Dunorlan Park in Tunbridge Wells and Knutsford, Cheshire – to choose from. Dishes from Kerridge’s own Michelin-starred Marlow pubs The Hand and Flowers and The Coach will pop up at the four festivals, alongside others from throughout Britain, and there’ll be chef demonstrations and a whole foodie village to shop in. Let’s not forget the soundtrack – brought to you live by the likes of Tom Odell and Razorlight.www.pubintheparkuk various dates between 17 May and 9 SeptemberSee a film under the starsIf you see one film this summer, just make sure it is outdoors. When it’s warm outside (and even when it’s not) there is no shortage of quirky film events, but Picnic Cinema – run by the arts organisation and charity Eden Arts, in Penrith, Cumbria – pulls out all the stops. You can dress up, bring your own picnic (the clue is in the title), and even sleep over. With music, dancing and surprise entertainment, amid spectacular scenic views, you may even forget you’re there to watch a film. Last year, revellers got suitably attired for Pulp Fiction, Withnail and I and The Wicker Man so we can’t wait to see what this year has in store. Just don’t forget your torch.picniccinema various datesJoin the circusIf you’ve ever dreamed of running away with the circus, now’s your chance. To mark 250 years since “the father of modern circus”, Philip Astley, pioneered this industry in London in 1768, Somerset House (in conjunction with Somerset House-based creative producers Crying Out Loud) will present two weekends of contemporary circus, hip-hop dance and music in the iconic grounds. Don’t miss the trailblazing Gandini Juggling performing a special commission, Cascade, in the fountain courtyard juggling within water jets to the sound of brass music will be a mesmerising sight to behold.somersethouse.org.uk 28-29 July 4-5 AugustGo to a literary festivalIf curling up with a hardback is your idea of heaven in the winter months, then flopping in a deckchair in the village of Hay-on-Wye should probably rate quite highly on your summer to-do list. Not that you’ll have much time to sit with your head in a book at Hay festival Wales, where Margaret Atwood leads a stellar line up of about 800 inspirational, thought-provoking discussions and panels. She’ll speak on The Handmaid’s Tale and beyond, while Philip Pullman, joined by Marina Warner and folklore academic Jack Zipes, promise tales of wonder, magic, and hope. Don’t miss the brilliant Letters Live, which returns for a fifth year.hayfestival 24 May-3 JuneWatch iconic bandsWhen it’s live music you want, settling on which summer festival to go to can be tricky, but this year’s Isle of Wight festival will take that decision out of your hands. It’s a special one, marking 50 years since its inauguration, and as a result, the festival has been appealing for stories from anyone who was there in 1968, watching Jefferson Airplane and T Rex et al. This year’s line-up also nods to nostalgia, with performances from Depeche Mode and Van Morrison.isleofwightfestival 21-24 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b5f8b4f650bbb99c4f25525ec30407cdc891ccf/0_64_1925_1155/master/1925.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e60912b6424fcbd9d8ffa838b6848ecd","title":"music festivals mixology how cruises got cool","story":"They have always been associated with the grey pound, but now cruise ships are trying to attract a millennial crowd. Will smaller boats, late-night stop-offs and better brunches tempt young people on board?aThink of cruise holidays and a whole host of images spring to mind. Endless buffets. Crushed velvet upholstery. Sex on the beach (the cocktail, obviously). His and hers dressing gowns. Jane McDonald. And, most of all, lots and lots of older people, from well-heeled fiftysomethings to time-rich retirees. Millennials? Not so much.That may be changing, though. Last July, the Cruise Lines International Association revealed that the average age of cruisegoers had fallen to a sprightly 46, its lowest figure in 20 years. (In the UK, the number is a more mature 55.) While those figures may not seem particularly dramatic, they are nevertheless encouraging for an industry that has been largely reliant on the grey pound.A number of cruise companies are working hard to coax younger holidaymakers on board. Last month saw the maiden voyage of what is being referred to as the first line aimed squarely at millennials. U by Uniworld, which offers river cruises through various European cities, including Amsterdam, Budapest and Frankfurt, made headlines when it announced that its ships would only accept 21- to 45-year-olds. That upper age limit has since been removed – Uniworld’s CEO, Ellen Bettridge, suggests the U line is instead for people with an adventurous mindset – but the appeal to youth remains.On board U’s two vessels, you will find silent discos and mixology sessions, while the black-tie meals associated with P\u0026ampO et al have been replaced by a more casual dining experience featuring brunch and small plates. It is practically Dalston on the Danube.Uniworld isn’t the only established cruise brand chasing younger customers. Next year, the German firm Amadeus is launching cruises along the Rhine, the Danube and the Seine with onboard “celebrity influencers”, who will document the trip on social media. The Regent Seas Explorer offers spin classes and designer handbag stores, while MSC’s Seaside class styles itself in the manner of a Miami South Beach condo, and has a teppanyaki grill and the longest zipline of any cruise ship on the planet. Then there are the floating festivals such as Anchored and Groove Cruise, the latter boasting EDM artists including Deadmau5 and Benny Benassi.Those festivals build on another unlikely trend: the theme cruise. A number of these cruises emerged at the beginning of the decade, featuring bands such as Paramore and Weezer, comic book conventions and, bizarrely, the cast of the Saw horror films. Even festival giant Coachella briefly got in on the act, with a lineup that featured Pulp, Hot Chip and LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy.One lesson learned from these theme events is that the cruising itself isn’t necessarily the main draw. “With something like Anchored, people didn’t necessarily know they were going on a cruise. This just happened to be a floating festival at sea,” explains Adam Coulter, the managing editor of the website Cruise Critic.Uniworld has similarly tried to play down the cruise bit of its millennial-friendly cruises, with Bettridge describing the U instead as a “floating boutique hotel that you can hop on and hop off”. It offers regular stop-offs at European cities, with the boats sitting in dock until the wee small hours for the benefit of late-night revellers. The boats are smaller, encouraging closer contact between passengers. There is also less of an emphasis on the mass group activities – the “herding around”, as Coulter puts it – of traditional cruise lines. Instead, holidaymakers are encouraged to explore, with bicycle tours, trips around food markets and visits to breweries or the beach.Twenty-seven-year-old Nina, from Canada, was on U’s first cruise. “I have done a lot of megaship cruises and this river cruise definitely has a different feel to it,” she says. “There are fewer people and you get to interact more. I am an active person, so I particularly liked how active the excursions were. A lot of biking, for sure.“The age group did play a factor in our decision-making,” she adds, noting that the average age of passengers on her boat was “late 20s and early 30s”.The new style of cruising could compete with more traditional package holidays for younger customers, Coulter believes. “You’ve got a ship that’s going to, say, Mykonos, Kos or Santorini in the middle of high season, when you can’t get a hotel room for love nor money.” A cruise ship, with accommodation, food and even some booze included in the price, might start to look tempting.How tempting remains to be seen. U’s cheapest holiday is £1,469 for eight days – less than many cruises, but still a significant outlay for most younger people. The scrapping of the upper age limit suggests they are not quite ready to throw themselves at this form of package holiday.Yet even if the millennial cruise proves to be little more than a passing fad, it is having an effect on the wider industry. Coulter notes that some features – more time in port, less emphasis on group activities – are being adopted by the bigger lines, which are also racing to include eye-grabbing technology such as indoor skying tunnels and giant HD screens.Perhaps most crucially of all, internet access – formerly one of the most retrograde aspects of the cruise experience, slow and often laughably expensive – has finally sailed into the 21st century, with affordable superfast wifi on many lines. Perfect, Coulter notes, for the “generation that wants to post selfies and put stuff on Instagram. They want their friends to know they are on a cruise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/490276454c73f4ee0caa6339e1b6659baf25e8cb/0_195_5138_3082/master/5138.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f64154506343076f3a8a5952e5b13e8","title":"eurovision 2018 five things we learned","story":"Politics is out and props are the new pixels in this glorious age for Europe’s music contestThis year’s Eurovision has been an absolute spectacle, with the final broadcast live from Lisbon’s Altice Arena to an audience of more than 200 million fans worldwide.Whether you love or hate the world’s biggest music show, it’s hard to deny that the modern era of Eurovision offers slick production, quality vocals and a musical smorgasbord that has something for everyone – from Hungarian heavy metal to Estonian popera. The event is the ultimate showcase of inclusivity, musical ersity and fun – fans come from all over the world to support their home country or their European favourites. Here’s what we learned from this year’s contest:1 Politics is out, but statement songs are inPolitical songs are frowned upon in Eurovision – Ukrainian 2016 winner Jamala’s lament on the 1944 Soviet Union deportation of Crimean Tatars raised a few eyebrows, particularly in Russia, at a time of heightened tension between the two countries. But that doesn’t mean you can’t make a statement through song. France’s entry Mercy tells the true story of a baby born last year on a ship rescuing migrants from the Mediterranean, while Netta from Israel reignited Girl Power for the #MeToo generation with her song Toy. The biggest surprise and delight was Ireland, whose entry played out a charming gay love story through dance – something which shouldn’t be a statement, but arguably is while LGBT+ rights are still far from assured in a number of Eurovision nations.2 Don’t mess with the European Broadcasting UnionTalking of Ireland, this year the organisers of Eurovision terminated its contract with Chinese broadcaster Mango TV after the nation opted not to broadcast the Irish performance from the first semi-final – showing a gay relationship contravenes Chinese censorship rules. Mango TV also censored the Albanian performance because their performer Eugent Bushpepa had visible tattoos. The EBU stated that censoring content “is not in line with the EBU’s values of universality and inclusivity and our proud tradition of celebrating ersity through music”. Ireland’s entry Ryan O’Shaughnessy approved: “I think it’s a really important decision by the EBU, they haven’t taken it lightly, and I think it’s a move in the right direction. I’m happy about it.” Well played, EBU. 3 Props are the new pixelsIn recent years the LED backdrop has played a big part in Eurovision staging, with increasingly sophisticated graphics bringing a new dimension to performances. Think Måns Zelmerlow’s stickman graphics from his winning song Heroes in 2015, or Sergey Lazarev’s 3D cityscape from 2016. This year Portugal decided to remove the pixel mesh from the stage, prompting participating countries to rethink how they were going to make a splash. Inevitably this resulted in massive props, including a giant pianocoffin from Ukraine, a vast light-up dress for Estonia and a spinning knife-throwing board for Finland. Best of all was Moldova’s Ikea wardrobes, setting the scene for a physical comedy performance that could never have played out in tiny pixels. More of this please.4 Real music is all musicWhen Salvador Sobral won Eurovision last year, he made a victory speech that railed against “disposable, fast-food music without any content”, calling his win “a victory for people who make music that actually means something”. He added: “Music is not fireworks, music is feeling so let’s try to change this and bring music back, which is really what matters.” This year’s Eurovision is a reminder that what constitutes meaning in music is unique to every listener, whether it’s Swedish pop, Hungarian rock, Irish balladeering or quirky sampling from Israel that’s unlike anything we’ve heard before. Eurovision is a variety box of fabulous fireworks, Salvador – it’s ALL real music, and it’s what makes Eurovision so wonderful. The favourite for this year’s Eurovision has been chopping and changing for weeks, and at the start of the evening it was the most open Grand Final in years – any one of six or seven acts could have taken the winner’s trophy. But in the end it was Israel’s Netta who raised the trophy for her Girl Power anthem Toy, with bonus chicken noises, Bjork-esque styling and lyrics like “I’m taking my Pikachu home”. The voting showed the huge disparity between what the juries loved (Austrian and German ballads, mostly), and what the public wanted to win (Cyprus’s Beyonce-style pop banger and Italy’s duet about the effects of war and terrorism). Netta’s win was loved by both – a triumph for something entirely different, which is exactly what Eurovision is all about.

It didn’t really workAidy Bryant’s mom, Georgeanne, has joined her onstage. Usually, Bryant says, the cold open is about politics, which is “isive”. Tonight, they’re here to talk about something “we all can celebrate together – moms”.Kenan Thompson’s mom is here too. “You like the show, right Mom?” he says. “We do,” she says, “except for all of the political stuff. We get it.”“Remember when I was in that production of The Crucible in high school?” Mikey Day says to his mother. “Yeah,” she says, “you know The Crucible is a lot like the witch hunt against President Trump.”“I don’t understand why everyone focuses on Trump at all, when you should be focused on Jesus,” says Chris Redd’s mom. “Jesus isn’t president, Mom,” he says. “And that’s the problem,” she replies.“I think Alec Baldwin does a great Trump impression,” says Colin Jost’s mom, “but why does it have to be so mean? Who writes that stuff?”“Yeah, I don’t know,” says Jost. “I guess it’s Michael Che.”Live from New York, the moms and their offspring announce, it’s Saturday night. Your host: Amy Schumer.“Some of you may have heard I got married this year,” she says, “so it’s in lockdown … I’m a little sad, I’m never going to get a ‘U up?’ text again.“The way that my now-husband proposed was so worthless, it was the morning, I was still asleep, he threw the box at me and said, ‘I got you this.’ But that’s a realistic proposal.’She jokes about weddings and periods. She’s a woman, after all! Then she turns to feminism. “Ladies, remember how we were raised with the illusion of equality. Wasn’t that funny?”First sketch: it’s a game show. Mother Knows Best. Schumer is the host, “a YouTube sketch comedian and a serious, genuine singer”, and Day and Kate McKinnon are a teenage son and mother with strong incest vibes.Hulu’s all-new spin-off show: Handmaids in the City, brought to you by the producers of Sex in the City and Margaret Atwood. Schumer as Offred is having breakfast with her pals Cecily Strong and Bryant in what looks like a prison cafeteria. “It’s a show critics are calling ‘so brutal’ and ‘more uplifting than the news’.”“As I was getting tased I was shocked at my lack of rights in this new world, but amazed by how stunning I look in red,” Schumer says, as a guard shoves a taser in her back.Next: Schumer as a mom telling her child his birth story, “the best day of my life”. “I had a big smile on my face the whole time,” she says, before they cut to her screaming in bed while her husband, Day, screams alongside her in scrubs.Thompson and Leslie Jones are soul-singing hosts of Gospel Brunch. Strong is a chef who is making teriyaki chicken wings. “Let’s praise them together!” says Thompson. “Oh, I would,” Jones says, “but I’m an atheist.” Redd sweeps her off with a broom. The next chef is played by Schumer in a brown long-bob wig, in the style of Paula Deen. “A great way to eat healthy is a smoothie,” she says, “if it’s through a straw it’s healthy and that’s a fact … you just blend up some ice, some low-fat milk, banana, cinnamon, and a whole pecan pie.“You’ve got more healthy tips,” says Jones, “but first we’re going to take a moment to remember the friends who’ve passed from heart disease.”Kacey Musgraves is the musical guest, and she sings High Horse under a glittering saddle dangling from the ceiling. I’m curious about the saddle: is it bespoke? Does she travel with it or was it made especially for this moment? Would it be appropriate for using to ride an actual high horse or is it made out of paper mache?Weekend Update! It’s been an OK week for Trump. “I don’t like when Trump is this quiet,” says Michael Che, “it’s like when I’m babysitting my nephew and he’s been quiet for too long.”“It’s really funny to me that all these companies were paying Michael Cohen for intelligence,” says Jost, “he’s like the word ‘durrrr’ became a person.”“Trump is undoing so much of Obama’s work that Obama’s going to start fading away in pictures like in Back to the Future,” says Che.They turn to Melania Trump’s new initiative, Be Best. “As in, ‘it would be best if you got a orce,’” says Che.Heidi Gardner joins them as a teen YouTube movie critic who twirls her hair a lot. “I guess I thought the new Jurassic Park was … fake?’ she says. “All of a sudden dinosaurs are back? That would never happen.”“OK,” she says, “I guess I’ll just shut up.”She doesn’t, it goes on for a while, but it’s not very funny.“Police at Yale University interrogated a black student when she was reported by a white student for sleeping in the common room … so if you’re a black student at Yale, stay woke,” says Che.Melissa McCarthy interrupts the next story in a “World’s Proudest Step-Mom” sweatshirt: she’s bringing Che a Claritin because she thinks his voice is “froggy”. “You may not have grown in my tummy,” she says, “but I love putting you around my tummy,” she says, pointing to the photo of Che on her sweatshirt. “Just keep going … I can’t wait to laugh!”Wake Up Denver: Beck Bennett is the host and Strong is reporting from the field, which is a production of L’il Rent, an “abridged, family-friendly version of the hit musical”. How is it child-appropriate? “HIV-AIDs is changed to diabetes,” director Day explains. “I used the ‘find and replace’ function in Microsoft Word and changed HIV-AIDs to diabetes.”Schumer is a “fiercely conservative” child – kneeling behind a wall like a muppet. He character “got diabetes from sharing an infected heroin needle … I learned some Spanish to play Mimi because she only speaks Spanish and I only speak white.”Musgraves returns for her second song, Slow Burn. The saddle is gone and I miss it, but it’s a nice song.Last call in an Irish bar: Schumer and McKinnon are two middle-aged lesbians holding it up. “You’ve scared all the men away,” Thompson, the bartender, says. Schumer and McKinnon start to flirt and it escalates until they gargle Purell and lick each others faces while Thompson tries to make himself disappear. It’s quite cruel. Is it OK to be this mean and unfunny about middle-aged lesbians? I’m not sure it is.And finally: a high school graduation in the style of a professional wrestling trailer. “Watch your principal confidently mispronounce that Indian kid’s name!” Secrets will be revealed, like when you realize the goth kid’s parents “are … like … normal?”And that’s it! All the moms returns to clap and hug it out and Schumer says “this is the best time in the world”, which I guess maybe it was for her because she didn’t have to watch the Irish bar sketch. Happy Mother’s Day!

Fans poured into the streets of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Sunday after the 25-year-old was announced a champion in Lisbon for her techno dance tune Toy, a pop anthem filled with clucks and synthesised beats.Exuberant crowds blocked traffic and many jumped into the public fountain at Rabin Square in front of city hall to rejoice in the win for the national sensation who had previously sung with the Israeli navy band.At bars lining the covered Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem, partygoers danced to loudspeakers blaring the track. Many sang the lyrics: “I’m not your toy, you stupid boy.”Israel’s victory means it will host next year’s finals, expected to take place in Jerusalem. “Thank you so much. I love my country. Next time in Jerusalem,” Barzilai yelled as she held her trophy after her win.Public figures across the country rushed to express their glee. Gal Gadot, the Israeli actor who played Wonder Woman in the recent blockbuster, said Netta represented “the real wonder in women”.Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, called to congratulate Barzilai, saying she was the country’s “greatest ambassador”. On Sunday morning, the prime minister attempted the chicken dance for reporters.At his cabinet meeting, Netanyahu opened by saying “boker Toy”, instead of “boker tov”, which means “good morning”.“These days Jerusalem is being blessed with many gifts,” the prime minister said. “We received another one last night with Netta’s thrilling and suspenseful victory. The gift is that Eurovision will come to Jerusalem next year we will be very proud to host it.”President Reuven Rivlin said on Facebook: “Proud of you, dear Netta. Waiting for everyone next year in Jerusalem!”Following an energetic electronic dance performance, Barzilai was awarded 529 points, beating favourites Cyprus into second place. Winners are decided through a mix of juries’ and viewers’ votes.The beatboxing looping artist, whose song was inspired by the #MeToo movement, is the first Israeli to win since 1998 when performer Dana International broke ground as the first transgender winner of the contest. The win comes during a period of significant focus on Jerusalem, the eastern part of which Israeli forces captured in 1967 and later annexed.Israel claims all of Jerusalem and Donald Trump has sent his daughter, Ivanka, to the Monday opening of Washington’s new embassy there. The move follows the US president’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, breaking with generations of international consensus that the holy city’s status should be settled as part of a two-state peace deal with the Palestinians.Several Israeli politicians seized on the win for political messaging. The Speaker of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, said Netta’s victory had brought national pride.“Not only the embassy is coming to Jerusalem, but the Eurovision too!” Yuli-Yoel Edelstein said on Saturday night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a446c6ec085c34dfc0e3fe6f75cb6cadde30a20d/0_339_3738_2244/master/3738.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8c666592d65d784c9da15d785d6c831","title":"pompeo us firms invest north korea kim jong un security assurances","story":"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korea agrees to fully dismantle its nuclear weapons program, the Trump administration will allow the American private sector to invest in the country.Pompeo also hinted that the US might assure Kim Jong-un he can stay in power after any deal.If a deal is reached at or after the summit meeting between Kim and Trump scheduled for Singapore on 12 June, Pompeo said on Fox News Sunday, “private sector Americans, not the US taxpayer” could “help build out the energy grid that needs enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea”. Americans could also help, he said, with investment in infrastructure and agriculture to help feed the North Korean people.Appearing on CBS’s Face the Nation, Pompeo floated the possibility of “sanctions relief”, a remark that jarred a little with a comment by Donald Trump’s national security adviser. John Bolton told CNN’s State of the Union: “I wouldn’t look for economic aid from us.”Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator, said private investment or sanctions relief for the North would “be the best money we ever spent”. Graham, a member of the Senate armed services committee, told CBS “there’d be a lot of support in Congress to give North Korea a better life. Provide aid, relieve sanctions with one condition: that you give up your nuclear weapons program in a verifiable way.”He also said “the average North Korean is about three inches shorter than … their neighbours in South Korea because of the terrible conditions in North Korea”. Studies have concluded that such a height difference does indeed exist.Pompeo met Kim last week in North Korea, for the second time, helping set the stage for the summit and securing the release of three Americans who the Pentagon said left hospital on Sunday. Asked if the US was in effect telling Kim “regime change will be off the table” if he meets American demands, Pompeo told Fox: “We will have to provide security assurances, to be sure.”The North has said it needs nuclear weapons to counter a US effort to strangle its economy and overthrow the Kim government. “Make no mistake about it, America’s interest here is preventing the risk that North Korea will launch a nuclear weapon into LA or Denver or to the very place we’re sitting here this morning,” Pompeo said, from Washington. “That’s our objective, that’s the end state the president has laid out and that’s the mission that he sent me on this past week, to put us on the trajectory to go achieve that.”Trump hailed progress with North Korea on Twitter on Saturday, writing: “North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month, ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th. Thank you, a very smart and gracious gesture!” Pompeo told Fox the North’s promise to destroy the site was “good news. Every single site that the North Koreans have that can inflict risk upon the American people that is destroyed, eliminated, dismantled is good news for the American people and for the world.”The secretary rejected suggestions that Trump’s praise of Kim and claims of success have been made too soon.“The president can have a successful outcome,” Pompeo said, “that the two of them can meet and see if there is sufficient overlap so that we can achieve the ultimate objective for the American people.”Pompeo was asked if in his talks with Kim he had discussed his previous exchange of insults with Trump, in which the US president coined the nickname “Little Rocket Man” for a leader who in return called him a “mentally deranged US dotard”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/967b90df7cb3df01524aa736319714829321f90d/0_0_3947_2368/master/3947.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e539510c67ca164d9d7e2dadc826ff56","title":"pro independence candidate set to become next catalan president","story":"Quim Torra is expected to win second round of votes, giving Catalonia the new government required to end direct rule from MadridCatalan politicians have cleared the way for a pro-independence candidate to be elected regional president and end the emergency direct rule imposed by Madrid during last year’s political crisis.The far-left pro-independence Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) party said it would abstain from an investiture vote in the regional parliament on Monday.The absence of its votes will leave pro-independence candidate Quim Torra with the simple majority needed to be elected regional president. “The CUP will not block the formation of a new government,” a statement by the party said.The formation of a new regional government is required for Spain to lift the state of direct rule.The Catalan regional assembly failed to elect Torra in an initial vote on Saturday, but at the second round scheduled for Monday, only a simple majority will be required, so he is expected to win.He was handpicked as a candidate by deposed Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, currently in exile in Germany and facing jail on rebellion charges for last year’s secession bid if he returns to Spain.Torra, 55, gave a combative speech during Saturday’s debate. He told parliament he was “working tirelessly for the Catalan republic” and signalled that the secession crisis is far from over, even if Catalonia does finally get a government.Separatist leaders declared Catalonia independent last October after an outlawed independence referendum. That prompted Madrid to impose direct rule and led to months of political limbo.Torra lambasted European institutions for their “unacceptable silence” over the Catalan crisis. He added he was ready to talk “without conditions” with the government of Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy.Both the Spanish government and the courts have declared the secession illegal and vowed to block it. Rajoy said that constitutional direct rule “could be used again if necessary,” if the next regional leadership did not respect the law.Catalonia is Spain’s richest and most populous region. It has its own distinct language and cultural traditions. Calls have increased in recent years for it to have more control over its finances, with some demanding outright independence.Last year’s secession attempt plunged Spain into its biggest political crisis in decades.Spain’s constitutional court strikes down parts of a 2006 charter on Catalan autonomy that had originally increased the region’s fiscal and judicial powers and described it as a “nation”. The court rules that using the word “nation” has no legal value and also rejects the “preferential” use of Catalan over Spanish in municipal services. Almost two weeks later, hundreds of thousands protest on the streets of Barcelona, chanting “We are a nation! We decide!”At the height of Spain’s economic crisis, more than a million people protest in Barcelona on Catalonia’s national day, demanding independence in what will become a peaceful, annual show of strength.Carles Puigdemont, who has replaced Mas as regional president, announces an independence referendum will be held on 1 October. Spain’s central government says it will block the referendum using all the legal and political means at its disposal.The Catalan parliament approves referendum legislation after a heated, 11-hour session that sees 52 opposition MPs walk out of the chamber in Barcelona in protest at the move. Spain’s constitutional court suspends the legislation the following day, but the Catalan government vows to press ahead with the vote.Police arrest 14 Catalan government officials suspected of organising the referendum and announce they have seized nearly 10 million ballots destined for the vote. Some 40,000 people protest against the police crackdown in Barcelona and Puigdemont accuses the Spanish government of effectively suspending regional autonomy and declaring a de facto state of emergency.Spanish government takes control of\u0026nbspCatalonia\u0026nbspand dissolves its parliament after secessionist Catalan MPs voted to establish an independent republic. Spanish prime minister,\u0026nbspMariano Rajoy, fires regional president, Carles Puigdemont, and orders regional elections to be held on 21 December.Regional elections were held in December, which separatist parties won, but every leadership candidate picked by the separatist camp since has fallen flat.Torra faces isions within the separatist camp, composed of the CUP, the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) party and Puigdemont’s Together for Catalonia grouping, according to Antonio Barroso, deputy research director at Teneo Intelligence.Barroso says the ERC wants a moderate approach to avoid a Madrid clampdown and prefers a longer independence game.“In contrast, Puigdemont’s strategy is to continue using every opportunity... to continue challenging the Spanish authorities and keep the secessionist momentum alive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab9b1c280bd330631538c6055a263b521fe04ca1/0_18_640_384/master/640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b090a1506a8d596a38d1cc610412a9e2","title":"two britons held hostage in democratic republic of congo freed","story":"Pair said they were ‘very relieved’ after release from kidnapping in gorilla sanctuaryTwo Britons and a local driver who were taken hostage on Friday in one of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s national parks have been released.Bethan Davies and Robert Jesty – the two British nationals – said they were “very relieved”, in a statement issued through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. They said: “We are very relieved that there has been a positive outcome to the kidnapping and are very grateful for the excellent support we have received. We do not plan to comment further.”The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, paid tribute to the kidnapped men and the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation for their help in securing the release.A park ranger, Rachel Makissa Baraka, who was travelling with the pair, was fatally injured when the men and their Congolese driver were seized during a visit to the Virunga national park, a renowned gorilla sanctuary in the east of the African country.A number of kidnappings have taken place during the past six weeks in the park, which is home to about one-quarter of the world’s remaining mountain gorillas. They come against the backdrop of rising violence across the province of North Kivu.Johnson said: “I am delighted to announce that two British nationals who were held hostage in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been released. I pay tribute to the DRC authorities and the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation for their tireless help during this terrible case.“My thoughts are now with the family of Virunga Park ranger Rachel Makissa Baraka, who was killed during the kidnapping, and with the injured driver and the released British nationals as they recover from this traumatic incident.”A statement issued by the park authorities said the men and their driver were receiving support and medical attention.The park’s director, Emmanuel de Merode, said: “We are deeply saddened by the death of Virunga national park ranger Baraka, whose life was tragically cut short whilst protecting the passengers and driver. We wish to extend our deepest condolences to her family and our sincerest gratitude for her bravery and service to Congo.”Baraka, who was one of the park’s 26 female rangers, died in hospital from injuries sustained on Friday. Eight rangers have died in Virunga since the start of the year, according to the park authorities.No further details were provided about the circumstances in which the pair were released. Congolese soldiers and park rangers have been conducting an operation to locate them after unidentified armed men ambushed the group on Friday morning north of Goma, the capital of DRC’s North Kivu province.The Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel to the cities of Goma. The advice adds: “Opportunities for gorilla trekking in the Virunga national park in North Kivu are limited, and armed groups are sometimes active within the park.”Eastern Congo has been the scene of successive waves of violence in the past two-and-a-half decades and was at the epicentre of two wars between 1996 and 2003.Rebel groups and militias still control large swathes of the territory. More than 175 rangers have died protecting Virunga national park, which is located in the rugged mountains and volcanic plains adjacent to neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda.

Irish support for her “customs partnership” proposal will be forthcoming only if she faces down the hard Brexiteers in her cabinet. Photograph: Tolga Akmentolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesThe Government expects British prime minister Theresa May to push ahead with proposals for a new “customs partnership” which it believes could pave the way for a soft Brexit, and which Dublin will support at next month’s European Union summit.The  understands the British government has told Dublin about the proposals, and the Government is likely to back Ms May at the summit.However, Irish support will be forthcoming only if Ms May faces down the hard Brexiteers in her cabinet and her government shows progress on a common understanding of the border “backstop”, the commitment to maintain an open border even without agreement.Downing Street has told Dublin it has problems with the backstop, but that Ms May’s proposals on a customs partnership would lessen the importance of the arrangement.Government sources agree that the potency of the backstop would be decreased and that it would become “less important” for Ms May if she put forward a customs proposal. It would make it “less offensive” to the DUP, which supports Ms May’s government.While further work would be needed on any customs proposal – even if Ms May gets it through her cabinet – it would “point to a direction of travel” from the UK government of where it wants to go, say sources. It would not be “a solution in itself”.The proposal would see British officials collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for an EU member state. The EU has already rejected this model, and a willingness to look afresh – even if it only “provides the basis” for future talks, according to one source – will be seen as a softening of the Irish and EU position. Earlier this week, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said of Ms May’s customs proposal: “The view of the EU is that it isn’t workable in its current form but it is something that perhaps we could make workable.”The backstop – which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border – was agreed in principle in December, although the UK has rejected the EU’s legal interpretation of it.However, in tandem with the customs proposal, the British government must “at a minimum” table its own interpretation of the backstop in the weeks before the June summit.It was further argued that the tabling of a customs proposal would make it easier for the backstop to “go green” – be agreed – and this would “leave space for the legal experts” to iron out the details over the summer.In effect, the mooted move would mean the EU taking Ms May’s proposal seriously in order to help her agree to the backstop. Senior Government figures believe the DUP’s priority is now that the North should be treated no differently to the rest of Britain, even if this means staying in a UK-wide customs partnership which would replicate many of the features of the customs union.DUP leader Arlene Foster has said Northern Ireland must move in “lockstep” with the rest of the UK.Although Ms May has said she could not accept the EU’s interpretation of the backstop, the Government is adamant the fallback option must be included in any Brexit deal. “We still need the backstop,” said a senior Government source."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3490565.1526048208!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit and ireland the border is a sideshow if you re an eel","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAttempts to conserve the Irish branch of the European eel have been complicated by BrexitThe autumn spawning migration of the European eel (s. Anguilla anguilla) to the Sargasso Sea is one of the great animal migrations.It is an arduous 6,500km journey from Europe’s inland waterways for the seriously endangered species which is threatened by historic overfishing and the degradation and loss of its habitats due to land reclamation, the construction of dams and reductions in water quality.And now attempts to conserve the Irish branch of the family have been, at the very least, complicated by, of all things, Brexit, their fate tied to the prospects for maintaining a frictionless border between North and South on the Erne river at Ballyshannon.The decline of eel stocks in Lough Erne, where commercial fishing has been halted, has been attributed in part to the attrition of both elvers entering the river from the Atlantic and of developed silver eels descending from Lough Erne through the turbines of the ESB hydroelectric power station.The EU requires member states to develop eel management plans and to take measures to ensure that at least 40 per cent of adult eels can escape from inland waters to the sea where they spawn. On the Erne that has meant the seasonal deployment of lorries with aerated water tanks to transport trapped live eels around the turbines.The protection of the eel is just one of 142 areas of North-South co-operation that are underpinned by joint obligations to EU regulations and to the Belfast Agreement, and which form a key part of the Irish strand of the Brexit discussions.They are a measure of the complex interdependence of both the cross-Border relationship and the scale and scope of the talks process.For the most part there is no question of the UK wishing to repudiate any of programmes that range from environmental projects to cross-Border hospitals, but EU negotiators and their UK counterparts have to work on legal language to copperfasten their post-Brexit future.The eels – provisions for safeguarding the EU’s management plan and regulating the cross-Border transport of live animals – will have their special place in Annex 2.8 of the Irish protocol to the Brexit orce deal, the Withdrawal Agreement, currently being discussed by the two sides.Discussions about the controversial Border “backstop” – an agreement would fully align Northern Ireland with the rules of the EU to avoid a hard border – have tended to catch the headlines and eclipse what can seem the more humdrum but nevertheless vital issues.As the protocol makes clear, however, the range and detail of the discussions is huge – as well as ensuring free trade in goods, the protocol says it shall also “be implemented and applied so as to maintain the necessary conditions for continued North-South co-operation, including in the areas of environment, health, agriculture, transport, education and tourism, as well as energy, telecommunications, broadcasting, inland fisheries, justice and security, higher education and sport”.Guaranteeing many of these, Irish officials stress, is also dependent on unhindered movement across the Border – the necessity for a Border deal permeates the entire protocol.It also contains provisions to safeguard the Common Travel Area between the Republic of Ireland and the UK, for joint citizenship provisions for Northern Ireland, and to “respect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent”.It requires the UK to guarantee that there is “no diminution of rights” caused by its departure from the EU, including in the area of protection against forms of discrimination enshrined in EU law.The Irish protocol currently runs to eight pages of the 129-page Withdrawal Agreement, which is now being turned into legal treaty language.The challenge EU leaders have set themselves is to complete broad agreement on the treaty text by June, so that it can be finalised by October and then be put to member states and the European Parliament for ratification ahead of the UK’s departure at the end of March, 2019.The Withdrawal Agreement contains the agreement on transition, or the “implementation period” as the UK calls it, and, like the rest of the text, it stands or falls on agreement on the whole package, including the Irish protocol.The important parallel discussions now under way on the “future relationship” between the EU and UK, essentially the future trading relationship, are also conditional on no “backsliding” on the agreements made in December in the “Joint Report” between the EU and UK which is reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement.Brussels and Dublin are adamant that unless the UK honours its commitment to the “backstop” provision of that December agreement, the future relationship talks will stop and the Withdrawal Agreement and the transition deal will be put in jeopardy.Those talks are set to produce a political outline of a future trading relationship which will be approved with the Withdrawal Agreement, although not having the same legal standing. A trade treaty can be agreed only once the UK is no longer an EU member-state.The Withdrawal Agreement text is colour-coded to reflect different stages of agreement – currently 15 per cent of the protocol is in green, effectively agreed, 37 per cent remains in yellow, on which there is political agreement on objectives but not on drafting, and 47 per cent is white or uncoloured, unagreed. There is much still to do.Most of the protocol white text reflects how the EU sees the operation of the “backstop” arrangement – the Border fallback guarantee should the UK prove unable to come up with and agree with the EU-preferred scenario for preventing a hard border.The Withdrawal Agreement text on safeguarding human rights post-Brexit remains in yellow – the UK is understood to accept in principle that there should be “no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity” in the North. However, the language proposed by the commission remains problematic, and the full enumeration of such rights in the annex to the treaty protocol has yet to be agreed.The range of these rights goes well beyond the issues of discrimination, equality and identity that are traditionally seen as central to the conflict – gender rights legislation, for example, or carers’ rights, or family law arrangements, including custody and maintenance issues, may have their roots in EU legislation.Although most of such regulations will be incorporated automatically into UK law by means of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, campaigners in the North worry over the abandonment by the UK of obligations under the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights.“The EU Charter acts as an important constitutional safeguard underpinning human rights protections in Northern Ireland and its removal weakens the quality and range of human rights protections available here,” the Northern Ireland Human Rights Consortium warns.The EU’s protocol text proposes that “The United Kingdom shall continue to facilitate the related work of the institutions and bodies set up pursuant to the 1998 Agreement, including the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the Joint Committee of representatives of the Human Rights Commissions of Northern Ireland and Ireland, in upholding human rights and equality standards.”Irish officials are said to be concerned at the lack of specific commitments to ringfence such funding.Other non-Border issues such as UK adherence to EU “state aid” rules – to prevent unfair competition through state subsidies – and the challenge of customs-free “transit” for Irish lorries and goods across the UK to EU markets also remain unagreed.Although not mentioned in the Irish protocol, and in theory an issue for the post-Brexit future relationship talks, because it is an issue of specific concern to Ireland and not other member-states, Irish officials are keen to see the issue taken up in the Irish talks strand.The UK signalled as far back as last August that it is willing to sign up to membership of the Common Transit Convention to facilitate the transit trade in both directions, and there are precedents using seals on lorries. But there are concerns at how the Irish lorries will be able to bypass potentially long customs queues at ports such as Dover. Transit across Northern Ireland will also require maintaining harmonised transport regulations such as recognition of hauliers’ licences.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

The helicopter will have twin, counter-rotating blades which will power through the thin Martian atmosphere at almost 3,000 rpm – about 10 times the rate of a helicopter on Earth.The helicopter has solar cells to charge its lithium-ion batteries, and a heating mechanism to keep it warm through the cold Martian nights.“The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet. The atmosphere of Mars is only one per cent that of Earth, so when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it’s already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet up,” said Mimi Aung, Mars Helicopter project manager.“To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.”Controllers on Earth will command the Mars Helicopter, through a system of commands send from the ground, rather than a real-time joystick.The full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred meters, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds. On its first flight, the helicopter will make a short vertical climb to 10 feet, where it will hover for about 30 seconds.Please review our commenting policyDame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s \u0026#39legacy\u0026#39 will be the cancer treatments she campaigned for, ministers announceMI5 chief calls for post-Brexit security plan in face of Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s \u0026#39aggressive and pernicious actions\u0026#39Netflix accepted into the British TV establishment with first major Bafta winTwo Britons kidnapped in Democratic Republic of Congo \u0026#39relieved\u0026#39 to be released unharmedMarina Litvinenko: Alex Salmond should give up his show on Russia Today UK set to become truffle capital of the world within 30 years, scientists sayThe ‘killer scorpions’ and poisonous frogs being mailed to China to feed exotic pet crazePregnant women who drink three cups of tea a day raise risk of overweight children, study findsBattered vase destined for charity shop sells for £87,000John Bolton says sanctions \u0026#39possible\u0026#39 for European companies operating in IranPoisoned darts, blowguns and the \u0026#39canine KGB death squads\u0026#39 cleaning up Russian cities ahead of the World CupWelsh farmer helping to fight Alzheimer\u0026#39s by growing high-altitude daffodils to combat diseaseComment: Israel at 70 is a better and less corrupt place than almost all of Britain\u0026#39s former coloniesLabour candidate for Lewisham East by-election withdraws as it emerges she compared Israel-Palestine conflict to \u0026#39Nazi persecution\u0026#39Former colleagues react to Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s deathWomen should test wine at dinner as they have better palates, study showsIsrael destroys Gaza tunnel as US prepares to open Jerusalem embassyRailway crossing gate drops on signalman and breaks his neck as Network Rail convicted of safety failingsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"battered vase destined charity shop sells 87000","story":"The vase (left) and Anne Beck receiving the good newsA battered vase which was on its way to a charity shop has sold at auction for close to £90,000.Grandmother Anne Beck always considered the chipped old china vase too damaged to display in her Eastbourne home.She inherited the foot-tall oriental decoration from her grandfather, an antique restorer, but neither he nor she ever repaired it, and Mrs Beck, 83, kept it in her garage for 11 years.Eventually she loaded it into her car to take to a charity shop, but on her way dropped in to an auctioneer’s valuation day to show off some glass fingerbowls, and mentioned the vase in passing.An expert at the Eastbourne Auctions house, in East Sussex, convinced her to add it to last week’s sale. It was advertised online with an estimated sale price of between £90 and £120.The vase would have been worth up to £500m if it were undamagedBut knowledgeable bidders spotted the true value of the item and drove the price up to £70,000. Including fees the German-based Chinese buyer paid £87,000 for the vase.Had it been undamaged experts estimate it might have been worth between £250m and £500m.The yellow floral vase has since been confirmed to date to the 18th century and was made for Chinese emperor Qinglong .It depicts a scene from Chinese mythology in which a deity receives birthday gifts.Mrs Beck said: After I consigned it for auction I thought that £100 would be nice.So I was absolutely amazed when I found out what it sold for. I couldn\u0027t quite believe it.I had a sit down and a cup of coffee afterwards but am still in a bit of a daze now.Mrs Beck, a widow, said she intends to spend some of the money on her two children and four grandchildren.Jeanette May of Eastbourne Auctions said: The vendor came in with these glass finger bowls and said she had a broken vase in the back of her car that she was taking to a charity shop.Our assistant went out and saw it rattling around on the back seat and said \u0027oh that\u0027s nice.\u0027 He knew it was good but didn\u0027t realise just how good.We are chuffed to bits for our client.”Please review our commenting policyDame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s \u0026#39legacy\u0026#39 will be the cancer treatments she campaigned for, ministers announceMI5 chief calls for post-Brexit security plan in face of Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s \u0026#39aggressive and pernicious actions\u0026#39Netflix accepted into the British TV establishment with first major Bafta winTwo Britons kidnapped in Democratic Republic of Congo \u0026#39relieved\u0026#39 to be released unharmedMarina Litvinenko: Alex Salmond should give up his show on Russia Today UK set to become truffle capital of the world within 30 years, scientists sayThe ‘killer scorpions’ and poisonous frogs being mailed to China to feed exotic pet crazePregnant women who drink three cups of tea a day raise risk of overweight children, study findsJohn Bolton says sanctions \u0026#39possible\u0026#39 for European companies operating in IranPoisoned darts, blowguns and the \u0026#39canine KGB death squads\u0026#39 cleaning up Russian cities ahead of the World CupWelsh farmer helping to fight Alzheimer\u0026#39s by growing high-altitude daffodils to combat diseaseComment: Israel at 70 is a better and less corrupt place than almost all of Britain\u0026#39s former coloniesLabour candidate for Lewisham East by-election withdraws as it emerges she compared Israel-Palestine conflict to \u0026#39Nazi persecution\u0026#39Former colleagues react to Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s deathWomen should test wine at dinner as they have better palates, study showsIsrael destroys Gaza tunnel as US prepares to open Jerusalem embassyRailway crossing gate drops on signalman and breaks his neck as Network Rail convicted of safety failingsMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"eurovision final","story":"Israel\u0027s Netta won Eurovision 2018, with her song Toy.

But everyone is in the dark as the powers-that-be have kept it hush-hush.An ITV News spokesperson said: “Tom’s off sick at the moment. Until his return, regular News at Ten presenters Julie Etchingham and Rageh Omaar will anchor the programme.”The news anchor was last seen in public at a charity lunch in London on March 6.He is understood to be recuperating in the £1m Hampshire home he shares with his wife Claudia, a jewellery designer.He is friendly with the Princes from his time as a Royal correspondent.In 2010 William chose Bradby to conduct his engagement interview and invited him to the wedding the following year.

He and American officials have long expressed concern that the nuclear deal did nothing to stem Iranian missile tests or thwart its activities supporting militias or proxies throughout the Middle East.Javad Zarif in Beijing as he attempts to shore up what is left of the nuclear dealFor its part, Tehran has launched a diplomatic effort to keep the deal together. Javad Zarif, the foreign minister, has embarked on a tour of signatories aimed at persuading them to help protect Iran from US sanctions.After meeting his counterpart in Beijing, Mr Zarif said on Sunday: “We hope that with this visit to China and other countries we will be able to construct a clear future design for the comprehensive agreement.”Please review our commenting policyMI5 chief calls for post-Brexit security plan in face of Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s \u0026#39aggressive and pernicious actions\u0026#39Netflix accepted into the British TV establishment with first major Bafta winTwo Britons kidnapped in Democratic Republic of Congo \u0026#39relieved\u0026#39 to be released unharmedMarina Litvinenko: Alex Salmond should give up his show on Russia Today UK set to become truffle capital of the world within 30 years, scientists sayThe ‘killer scorpions’ and poisonous frogs being mailed to China to feed exotic pet crazePregnant women who drink three cups of tea a day raise risk of overweight children, study findsBattered vase destined for charity shop sells for £87,000Poisoned darts, blowguns and the \u0026#39canine KGB death squads\u0026#39 cleaning up Russian cities ahead of the World CupWelsh farmer helping to fight Alzheimer\u0026#39s by growing high-altitude daffodils to combat diseaseComment: Israel at 70 is a better and less corrupt place than almost all of Britain\u0026#39s former coloniesLabour candidate for Lewisham East by-election withdraws as it emerges she compared Israel-Palestine conflict to \u0026#39Nazi persecution\u0026#39Former colleagues react to Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s deathWomen should test wine at dinner as they have better palates, study showsIsrael destroys Gaza tunnel as US prepares to open Jerusalem embassyRailway crossing gate drops on signalman and breaks his neck as Network Rail convicted of safety failingsMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"marina litvinenko alex salmond should give show russia today","story":"Alex Salmond urged to give up his RT showThe widow of Alexander Litvinenko, the ex-spy who was assassinated in London, has urged Alex Salmond to give up his talk show on the controversial channel Russia Today.Marina Litvinenko said his appearance on what she called a “propaganda-style station” could not be excused.Mr Salmond has been widely criticised since agreeing in November to host a weekly show on the Kremlin-backed network. Nicola Sturgeon, who succeeded him as First Minister, said she would have advised against RT and suggested he seek a different channel”.Mrs Litvenko’s husband, a former Russian spy, died after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium-210 in 2006. A decade later a public inquiry concluded his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian president Vladimir Putin.She said she believed Mr Salmond was appearing on RT because he thought he might do good things “in a wrong place”.Marina Litvinenko said she would not appear on RTShe added: “It doesn\u0027t work. If he wants to be supported by his own people, he needs to think twice.“My message is that I believe he is a people\u0027s man, and everybody can make mistakes, but you need to think twice. It would be better to give it up, but it\u0027s his own decision.She compared the former first minister to the ex-German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder who worked for the Russian energy firm Gazprom after leaving office.Mrs Litvinenko told the Sunday Herald: Unfortunately, we have not only Schroeder, but we have other people now like Salmond, who is happy to work for Russian money.”She also said she was “suspicious” of Sputnik, a pro-Kremlin news agency that has its UK HQ in Edinburgh.“When you live in a democratic country and when you expect freedom of speech…you agree everybody has a different opinion.“But this is not RT and Sputnik, unfortunately it’s not freedom of speech, it’s propaganda-style media,” she said.“For Scottish people and people living in the UK, freedom of speech is important and sometimes we think watching RT or Sputnik is like to check a different opinion but, again, you don’t understand how easily it became a manipulation.”An inquiry said Alexander Litvinenko had \u0026#39probably\u0026#39 been killed with Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s approvalShe added that it looked as if Russia had “very serious support” in Scotland and that after the 2014 independence referendum it would have been clear to the Russian government that Scotland was trying to “make the life of the UK not very easy”.“If they have a chance to disturb they will use it. It is quite suspicious. Why exactly after the referendum was Sputnik based in Scotland?”Mrs Litvinenko said she would not appear on RT because she favoured “justice and honesty” and claimed it covered issues “upside down” and tried to “brainwash people”.A spokesman for RT said: We sympathise with Marina Litvinenko in her loss and hope that she may find solace in this life that has treated her so cruelly.A spokesman for Sputnik said it was cast as a Kremlin propaganda machine “without any evidence whatsoever”, adding: “We aim to provide a balanced, truthful,  and alternative view of news and current events. Sputnik has no intention or aim to influence democratic deacons in Britain.”Mr Salmond, who has repeatedly insisted he has full editorial control, tweeted that many people thought his show was rather good at giving an alternative view to the MSM (main stream media).Please review our commenting policyDame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s \u0026#39legacy\u0026#39 will be the cancer treatments she campaigned for, ministers announceMI5 chief calls for post-Brexit security plan in face of Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s \u0026#39aggressive and pernicious actions\u0026#39Netflix accepted into the British TV establishment with first major Bafta winTwo Britons kidnapped in Democratic Republic of Congo \u0026#39relieved\u0026#39 to be released unharmedUK set to become truffle capital of the world within 30 years, scientists sayThe ‘killer scorpions’ and poisonous frogs being mailed to China to feed exotic pet crazePregnant women who drink three cups of tea a day raise risk of overweight children, study findsBattered vase destined for charity shop sells for £87,000John Bolton says sanctions \u0026#39possible\u0026#39 for European companies operating in IranPoisoned darts, blowguns and the \u0026#39canine KGB death squads\u0026#39 cleaning up Russian cities ahead of the World CupWelsh farmer helping to fight Alzheimer\u0026#39s by growing high-altitude daffodils to combat diseaseComment: Israel at 70 is a better and less corrupt place than almost all of Britain\u0026#39s former coloniesLabour candidate for Lewisham East by-election withdraws as it emerges she compared Israel-Palestine conflict to \u0026#39Nazi persecution\u0026#39Former colleagues react to Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s deathWomen should test wine at dinner as they have better palates, study showsIsrael destroys Gaza tunnel as US prepares to open Jerusalem embassyRailway crossing gate drops on signalman and breaks his neck as Network Rail convicted of safety failingsMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/13/TELEMMGLPICT000155873506_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"nothing like meghan markle reckless hugging makes shudder","story":"Prince Harry\u0026#39s fiancee reportedly greets guards with a hugI would not prosper long in the apparently touchy-feely Kensington Palace Kissing used to be the great social pitfall.

It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but Harry and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm.The core aspects of the wedding, including the church service, associated music, flowers, decorations and reception, will be paid for by the Royal Family, with Ms Markle’s parents both set to attend.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesFormer Suits star Ms Markle told last year how she could not wait to say yes to the prince when Harry got down on one knee as they cooked a roast chicken dinner at his home, Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.Indicating the depths of his feeling for his bride-to-be, the prince revealed in a television interview: It was this beautiful woman just sort of literally tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, Windsor. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Royal sources said the guest list will be restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, and was taken both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small, and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.As well a dress code, the Royal guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day. The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Read more about who they are here.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayOther guests will include members of Ms Markle\u0027s family - her mother Doria Radlan and father Thomas Markle Snr - and of course many members of the royal family.Tennis star Serena Williams and Ms Markle\u0027s former Suits co-stars Sarah Rafferty, Patrick J Adams and Wendell Pierce could also be on the list.The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsThe Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be seen as part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be making their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999.  The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. They will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.Harry also has to decide whether to wear a wedding ring. William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a “special place” during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will then undertake a two mile tour of Windsor greeting well-wishers. They will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for their reception.Read more about the procession here.Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Scant details have emerged about the receptions so far, but we do know that the couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake.Kensington Palace said Ms Ptak, owner of the Violet Bakery in Hackney, will create a cake for the Royal wedding incorporating the bright flavours of spring. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonIt is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father Thomas Markle choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, is expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle, but may not make a formal speech.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesIn February, one of the five original Spice Girls Mel B hinted that the Spice Girls were expected to reunite for the Royal wedding. The singer, known to fans as Scary Spice, claimed she had received a proper invitation during an appearance on a television chat show.Fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham also appeared to let slip she was attending the big day during an appearance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden earlier in April. Asked if she would be among the guests, she said: I, uh, I, I don\u0027t know...However, it has recently been reported that the Spice Girls have no plans to perform at the wedding, and have not been rehearsing for the event.Victoria and her husband David were invited to the 2011 royal wedding. Prince Harry with the Spice Girls in 1997Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday declared.Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers plan to extend licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on the nights of Friday 18 and Saturday 19 May - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.

The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleMI5 chief calls for post-Brexit security plan in face of Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s \u0026#39aggressive and pernicious actions\u0026#39Netflix accepted into the British TV establishment with first major Bafta winTwo Britons kidnapped in Democratic Republic of Congo \u0026#39relieved\u0026#39 to be released unharmedMarina Litvinenko: Alex Salmond should give up his show on Russia Today UK set to become truffle capital of the world within 30 years, scientists sayThe ‘killer scorpions’ and poisonous frogs being mailed to China to feed exotic pet crazePregnant women who drink three cups of tea a day raise risk of overweight children, study findsBattered vase destined for charity shop sells for £87,000John Bolton says sanctions \u0026#39possible\u0026#39 for European companies operating in IranPoisoned darts, blowguns and the \u0026#39canine KGB death squads\u0026#39 cleaning up Russian cities ahead of the World CupWelsh farmer helping to fight Alzheimer\u0026#39s by growing high-altitude daffodils to combat diseaseComment: Israel at 70 is a better and less corrupt place than almost all of Britain\u0026#39s former coloniesLabour candidate for Lewisham East by-election withdraws as it emerges she compared Israel-Palestine conflict to \u0026#39Nazi persecution\u0026#39Former colleagues react to Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s deathWomen should test wine at dinner as they have better palates, study showsIsrael destroys Gaza tunnel as US prepares to open Jerusalem embassyRailway crossing gate drops on signalman and breaks his neck as Network Rail convicted of safety failingsMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding schedule timings marriage harry meghan","story":"The Royal wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry is now just over a week away, which means the final preparations for the big day will no doubt be being tweaked and polished as you read. The ceremony, which takes place on Saturday May 19, will be held in Windsor it will include two wedding receptions and a carriage procession, as well as the service.Prince Harry and Ms Markle have broken tradition by choosing to hold their wedding on a Saturday, as royal weddings usually take place during the week. The wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge was held on a Friday and the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales was held on a Wednesday on both occasions the public were given an extra bank holiday.While Downing Street have said there are no plans to give Britons a day off for this year\u0027s royal nuptials, pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open until 1am on Friday May 18 and the day of the wedding itself.Amber Rudd, the former Home Secretary, opened a consultation on the plans in January. She said: “The Royal wedding will be a time of national celebration, and we want everyone to be able to make the most of such an historic occasion.“I hope that this relaxation of the licensing hours will allow people to extend their festivities and come together to mark what will be a very special moment for the country.”Here is everything you need to know about how the big day will unfold.WATCH:  How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingThe service will take place at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.There, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeMeghan\u0027s father will meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door, before walking her down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House.

pioneering genetic technology which can dramatically speed up their production, means rare black truffles are starting to be grown in BritainBritain is set to become the truffle capital of the world within 30 years, scientists have said, as they are developing a new genetically enhanced variety which grow twice as fast.It comes as a shift in climate means truffle farmers in the Mediterranean are facing exceptionally dry weather, creating a chronic shortage of the flavoursome fungus. Mediterranean black truffles are mostly found in northern Spain, southern France and northern Italy because they need warmer and drier conditions.Shrinking exports from the Med have seen truffle prices in the UK double to £900 a kilo.At present the UK produces around one tonne of truffles a year, compared to France’s 50-80 tonnes.But now warmer conditions in the UK and pioneering genetic technology which can dramatically speed up their production, means rare black truffles are starting to be grown in Britain, with the UK set to become a major producer within a generation.An Italian truffle hunter (also known as a trifulau), holds a handful of white truffles (tartufi bianco) after finding the fungus among the roots of trees in the hills around Alba, PiedmontClimate modelling by Dr Paul Thomas, who specialists in the cultivation of truffles at the Stirling University, found mild Mediterranean weather that has made them a staple of French cuisine will be replaced by harsh droughts that will wreck production over the next 30-40 years.He said: “That drying is a long-term trend in Europe so the future looks pretty good for British truffles,” said Dr Thomas, who called for a strategic increase in production if farmers in the UK were to capitalise on climate change.Dr Thomas has been working with farmers to develop production in the UK not only of native species but also highly-prized French varieties, described by one French gourmet (Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin) as “the diamonds of the kitchen.”With the climate trends Dr Thomas now anticipated, the UK was perfectly placed to “become pivotal in the global truffle industry” but it would require a big commitment by government, industry and their agencies, he said.We don’t have it in our psyche as a national product. We need to change that and get support from the Forestry Commission and higher up to scale it up. Given that we did it all 100 years ago, it is like bringing back a native crop.”Mr Thomas is also developing lab techniques which are doubling the growth speed of commercially grown crops.It involves epigenetics, where the plant’s genes are switched on and off, to speed up truffle growth for harvest in three years’ time instead of a typical growth time of six years.The process sees seeds inoculated with truffle fungus, grown in greenhouses, and then planted them at sites around the UK.The latest – hazel whips with their roots enveloped in fungus – were planted in Bute off the west of Scotland last year. Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s \u0026#39legacy\u0026#39 will be the cancer treatments she campaigned for, ministers announceMI5 chief calls for post-Brexit security plan in face of Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s \u0026#39aggressive and pernicious actions\u0026#39Netflix accepted into the British TV establishment with first major Bafta winTwo Britons kidnapped in Democratic Republic of Congo \u0026#39relieved\u0026#39 to be released unharmedMarina Litvinenko: Alex Salmond should give up his show on Russia Today The ‘killer scorpions’ and poisonous frogs being mailed to China to feed exotic pet crazePregnant women who drink three cups of tea a day raise risk of overweight children, study findsBattered vase destined for charity shop sells for £87,000John Bolton says sanctions \u0026#39possible\u0026#39 for European companies operating in IranPoisoned darts, blowguns and the \u0026#39canine KGB death squads\u0026#39 cleaning up Russian cities ahead of the World CupWelsh farmer helping to fight Alzheimer\u0026#39s by growing high-altitude daffodils to combat diseaseComment: Israel at 70 is a better and less corrupt place than almost all of Britain\u0026#39s former coloniesLabour candidate for Lewisham East by-election withdraws as it emerges she compared Israel-Palestine conflict to \u0026#39Nazi persecution\u0026#39Former colleagues react to Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s deathWomen should test wine at dinner as they have better palates, study showsIsrael destroys Gaza tunnel as US prepares to open Jerusalem embassyRailway crossing gate drops on signalman and breaks his neck as Network Rail convicted of safety failingsMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"\u003cul\u003e\u003cli class= lazy   data-original= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/09/16/eurovision-costumes-1-0.jpg","title":"eurovision winner netta israel latest cultural appropriation japan costume","story":"Singer has said she is a huge fan of Japanese culture including Pokemon, but some Eurovision viewers were unimpressed by her costume and stage themesWhat is Eurovision without controversy?

If y\u0027all got offended over that girlCan I, however, ask if anyone here has already commented on the quite shocking Japanese cultural bastardisation-appropriation going on in Netta\u0027s song?Others pointed out that appropriation occurs most commonly when a dominant culture lifts elements of a minority culture for its own benefit, and they did not consider Israeli culture dominant over Japanese.I saw Netta\u0027s performance and the cultural appropriation tweets did not disappoint. But appropriation is when a dominant culture adopts traits of a minority culture. I really don\u0027t consider Israeli culture dominant over Japanese or vice versa. 🤷‍♀️Its not cultural appropriation as long as it is done with admiration of the culture.

The series follows Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s.It’s perhaps the archetypal image of the cult we’ve come to recognise: the followers of Rajneesh, who died in 1990, dressed in orange their leader was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities) the disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead, lost contact with their families.But cults don’t have to follow the pattern of Rajneeshpuram, as the Oregon ranch was renamed, or the bloodbaths at Jonestown or Waco, where David Koresh’s sect the Branch Davidians was raided by the FBI in 1993. More often than not, they are more mundane than that… but no less damaging.Rajneesh, also known as Osho, with his ‘Orange People’ followers (Netflix)Katy Morgan-Davies last month published a book about her experiences living in Brixton with the cult leader – and her father – Aravindan Balakrishnan, who was jailed on charges of rape and imprisonment in 2015. Morgan-Davies managed to flee the cult in 2013 after 30 years – her entire life.Cults are back in the news again, but for Ian Haworth they never went away. As the head of the UK-based Cult Information Centre, he spends his life collating information on cults, offering advice and help to those who have escaped – or wish to – and campaigns for stricter legislation to control the reach and influence of these malign groups.“I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults,” says Haworth. “That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thing.”Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan (PA)That interest comes in peaks and troughs, naturally, with particular focus at the moment thanks to Wild Wild Country and Morgan-Davies’ memoir. Haworth says: “I suppose the biggest peak we’ve had began on 1 January 1999, when there was a huge amount of cult activity related to the millennium, when all kinds of things were promised or predicted. Of course, mathematically, the millennium ended at the end of the year 2000, not the end of 1999, but cult leaders don’t really care about such things. They care about money, and controlling people, and power.”Born in Lancashire, the son of a farmer, Haworth emigrated to Canada in 1972 while in his twenties. By 1978 he was working as a communications consultant for a large company, and had never given a thought to cults. Aged 31, he happened to be stopped by a woman with a clipboard in a Toronto street.After fleeing a cult in 1978, Ian Haworth has dedicated his life to helping others in the same situation (Cult Information Centre)“She was very attractive and I was very single,” remembers Haworth. “When she asked me if I had time to answer a few questions for what I thought was market research, I said yes.”But after only half a dozen questions, the tone of the exchange altered. The woman told Haworth that his answers indicated he’d fit in very well with a group she was involved with, and that it would enable him to give something back to society rather than just taking. A meeting was taking place the following week and Haworth was invited along.“I turned up and there were about a hundred people there,” he says. “A woman was talking about her addiction to alcohol and drugs, and how this group had helped her. I was planning to sneak away at the end, because I’d been brought up to be polite and didn’t want to just walk out. Then they brought out drinks and cakes, and as I’d paid $2 (£1.50) to attend I decided I might as well get my money’s worth before leaving.”The world of Cults: in picturesThe world of Cults: in picturesAravindan Balakrishnan, known as ‘Comrade Bala’ within the women-only collective he founded 40 years ago, carried out a brutal campaign of sexual degradation against the women over several decades. In this picture, he stands with some of his cult followers including his daughter.

Revealing her real identity, Miss Morgan-Davies said that waiving her anonymity was an important step – “to retrieve the identity the cult tried to steal from me”.\u0026#13PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Evidence picture showing the bedroom of the imprisoned daughter of Aravindan Balakrishnan.

Aravindan Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years in 2016. To keep his devotees in check, Balakrishnan invented \u0027Jackie\u0027, which he said could kill or trigger earthquakes if anyone went against his will. He claimed that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 space shuttle disaster and Jackie, an invisible war machine, was responsible for the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour party leader. PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Jim Jones, founder of the Peoples Temple sect in Jonestown, north Guyana, in 1978. Believers of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ followed Reverend Jones to Guyana in the Seventies, hoping to create a utopia in the jungle. Jonestown was envisaged as a “rainbow family” of all ages and races, the preacher had promised them: “Divine principles. Total equality. A society where people own all things in common, where there is no rich or poor, where there are no races.” APwords by Adam LusherReverend Jones wanted to create a glorious sacrifice, a defiant act of “revolutionary suicide” that would echo through history. Some disciples willingly colluded, cheering as he exhorted them to kill themselves and their children. But the bodies found with bent needles in their arms testified to the fact that some refused and were forcibly injected. Rexwords by Adam LusherWhen they finally counted the bodies after what would become known as the Jonestown massacre of 18 November 1978, the total came to 918, of whom 304 were children. They had been persuaded to “drink the Kool-Aid”, Flavor Aid, used to mask the bitter taste of cyanide, mixed with a dash of Valium.APwords by Adam LusherMaude Julien, now 60, was forced to hold onto an electric fence for without showing feeling as a child. The ritual was considered to be a test of her willpower by her father, who wanted to make her “superhuman”.\u0026#13Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which was built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s. Rajneesh, who died in 1990, was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities). His disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead and lost contact with their families.During a break he went into the corridor for a cigarette, and that’s when the cult members pounced. Haworth had seen his doctor not long before and been told if he carried on smoking like he did he’d be lucky to see 40. The group told him that they would absolutely guarantee he would stop smoking if he attended a further course for $220. He’d already looked into smoking-cessation courses that were of comparable cost, so decided he’d give this one a go.“The course took place in September, 1978,” says Haworth. “By the end of the course I’d given notice at my job, promised to dedicate my life to the cult, and handed over all my savings, which amounted to about $1,500.”Jonestown commune mass suicide in 1978 (AP)Even now, Haworth cannot identify the tipping point that turned him from someone who’d turned up for a meeting at the behest of an attractive woman to someone who gave himself, body and soul, to a cult, other than mid-way through the course when he stopped smoking. “I suppose that was the moment I went over to them – they had done what they said they would do.”Cults often thrive on feeding into people’s desires. Sometimes they will promise success, artistic or creative talent, fulfil a desire in their targets to effect social change or, as with Haworth, to “give something back” to the world. They will promise freedom from addictions or improved physical or mental health. They’re what Haworth calls therapy cults, as opposed to the religious cults that offer more spiritual promises.If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had. You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situationOver the next month, Haworth tried to recruit his friends and even neighbours to the group. They were appalled at the change in him, but, he says, “I thought they were wrong, I knew they weren’t part of the elite, like I was.”It was an almost textbook recruitment, and Haworth firmly believes he would have been lost to everyone who knew him but for one error on the part of the cult. “Most cults programme their members against the media very early on. These people didn’t do that,” he says. And that was what saved him.A neighbour gave him a copy of the Toronto Star which had featured a front-page exposé of the group Haworth was involved in, written by the investigative reporter Sidney Katz. Haworth read the piece and contacted Katz immediately to verify his facts. He then, as he describes it, “fell apart at the seams”. Having seen Katz’s research and evidence first hand, at the invitation of the journalist, Haworth angrily confronted the cult’s leaders, and they effectively banished him. He was finally free of them.“That was in October,” he says. “Then, in the November, everything came out about the Jonestown cult. And I knew that could have been me. It took me 11 months to fully recover and get back to myself.”NXIVM (which calls itself a ‘multi-level marketing organisation’) member Allison Mack leaving US District Court after her bail hearing in Brooklyn (Getty)It took that long for the nagging whispers of “Cult Ian”, as Haworth describes the person he was when he was with the group, to be finally silenced, and for “Real Ian” to reassert himself. And good sense would dictate that was the point he turned his back on cults forever and got on with his life.“I come from a farming background in Lancashire,” says Haworth. “People used to say, ‘If there’s summat up, then tha’ does summat about it’. So I did summat about it.”Sidney Katz put Haworth in touch with a TV producer called Peter Scott and together they set up what was first called the Council for Mind Abuse, and which later metamorphosed into the Cult Information Centre in 1987, now run as a charity.I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults. That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thingHaworth and Scott concentrated on the group he had been involved with, even handing out flyers to a party of new recruits flown into Canada, exhorting them to go back to the airport. Faced with Haworth’s evidence, many of them did. Eventually, the resistance proved too much for the group. “Toronto wasn’t big enough for the both of us,” he smiles. “They got out.”Haworth doesn’t know where they are now, or if they still exist. Cults change their names often, to keep one step ahead of the media or inquisitive minds, and to muddy the paper trail they leave behind. Besides, he soon had more than enough on his plate as more and more people began to get in touch, especially after he had relocated back to the UK.One of the Cult Information Centre’s primary roles is working with ex-cult members. He likens the trauma that recovering cult followers go through to PTSD, and says systems to deal with and help them are variable, if present at all.He would also like to see stronger laws to deal with cults there’s no specific legislation surrounding them, and it’s only when cult leaders are discovered to have committed actual crimes, such as Aravindan Balakrishnan in 2015, that the law can act.Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh surrounded by devotees (Netflix)The Aravindan Balakrishnan case, and the revelations of Katy Morgan-Davies in her new book, add an extra dimension to Haworth’s work. It’s one thing to try to help cult members who have managed to break free return to their old, pre-cult lives, but what of those born into cults?“If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had,” says Haworth. “You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situation.”And don’t think it is only stupid people who would fall for a cult. Experts say that cults are most likely to be attractive to intelligent, well-educated people… they have flexible minds can consider and be seduced by the alternative lifestyles offered by cults.Documentary about alleged sex cult NXIVM being producedSmallville actor allegedly tried to recruit Emma Watson to ‘sex cult’Waco: what really happened when David Koresh’s cult faced the FBI?From Jonestown in the Seventies to Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s to Brixton in the 2000s: cults endure, and spring up all across the world. Nothing about modern life and its complexities has inured us against the attractions of a charismatic guru or cult leader.“They start off wanting the usual things,” says Haworth. “Money, sex, power over people. Then, after perhaps about 10 years, they start to believe the things they say, they maybe start to believe they are gods.”And as long as the false gods continue to prey on the innocent, Ian Haworth will continue his 40-years-and-counting battle against the scourge of the cults.For more information on Haworth’s work at the Cult Information Centre go to cultinformation.org.ukor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Zero class despite their toff parents spending ludicrous amounts on their ‘education’.”Another said: “It’s 2018 and not much has changed! Not only did @oratoryschool allow students to do blackface, they have completely ignored the issue.”A third called for the boys to be expelled.the guy made twitter to message me and say that because he finds it “funny” that i should too?? tell me what’s “humorous” about slavery and black face??? i’m intrigued.A spokesperson for the school said in response to complaints: “It has been brought to our attention that a photo was recently posted on social media of a small number of pupils from our school while dressed in an offensive manner.“The headmaster and senior staff were present for the photo and refused to allow the offensively dressed pupils to participate and the photo was taken without them being included.“The photo – the existence of which we were unaware – that was taken and posted on social media was taken unofficially and was in no way with the consent or blessing of the school.”The statement said school chiefs were “extremely shocked and saddened” that it had happened and apologised “unreservedly” for the offence caused.“We are dealing with this matter internally,” it added.“The Oratory School unequivocally condemns racist imagery of any sort.“We will strengthen our tutorial programme to ensure that it is understood by all our pupils that such representations are utterly unacceptable.”In 2014, a former housemistress at the school told a tribunal a pupil stoned wild birds, skinned live cats and humiliated younger boys.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Fishing accounts for 41 per cent of the islands’ economy and two-thirds of the corporation tax received by its treasury. UK threatens less EU security cooperation if locked out of GalileoAny negative impact from Brexit on the islands’ economy is likely to be a thorny issue for Brexiteers, for many of whom the Falklands is a touchstone issue.Speaking after recent trips to Brussels and London the chair of the islands’ eight-person legislative assembly told The Independent that potential disruption caused by exit from the single market “would put at risk the current profitability of our fishing industry and would impact both the wider economy and government revenue”.The Falkland Islands government also says “any material change that results in less beneficial importexport access could be potentially catastrophic for the Falkland Islands economy and people”, according to a report drawn up by the UK Overseas Territories Association.The British government says it has “prioritised securing the freest and most frictionless trade possible with the EU”, although in fact it has pledged to leave the single market and customs union.Any material change that results in less beneficial importexport access could be potentially catastrophic for the Falkland Islands economyThe islands mostly export loligo squid to Spain, a seafood that accounts for 89 per cent of their exports to the EU. The Falklands provided over a third of the loligo squid imported by Spain last year once it arrives in the port of Vigo it enters the EU supply chain and is distributed around the world.Representatives of the islands’ fishing industry believe that the “worst case scenario” of having to trade on World Trade Organisation rules as advocated by some Brexiteers would cause a £9m hit to revenues because of tariffs – a large sum for the 3,400-population archipelago that would amount to more than £2,600 per person.The islands’ fishing association says cultivating other markets for squid would be “difficult”, especially in Asia, where “demand is highest but competition is strong, and both political and tariff barriers exist”. In the event of a “no deal” Brexit the islanders say they would be left with no choice but to seek support from the British state to prop up their fishing industry.Theresa May has pledged to leave the single market, stating that remaining in it would be incompatible with properly leaving the EU. The British government hopes to secure tariff- and quota-free access to EU markets for fish and seafood through a free trade agreement – but Seafish, a non-departmental public body that supports the British fishing industry, says Brexit has caused “considerable levels of uncertainty” for the sector.While not technically a member of the single market the Falkland Islands currently enjoys preferential access as a result of its status as a self-governing UK overseas territory and Britain’s membership. It pays no tariffs and is exempt from quotas.Teslyn Barkman, one of the eight elected members of the Falkland Islands’ legislative assembly told The Independent: “We have worked hard over many years to establish and grow our fishing industry – it really is a Falkland Islands success story, and one that has allowed us to stand on our own two feet financially.“As a result of our current tariff- and quota-free access to the EU single market, our fishing companies have been able to develop strong markets across Europe for our premium loligo squid, which is our primary export.  Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Sufficient care and rest during musth “will be ensured”the forests committee will meet at least twice a year – once just before festival season, when all violators should be reported “so that necessary steps are taken for ensuring the safety of the animals as well as that of the public”another meeting will be just after the season to take stock of implementation of the rules Wildlife wardens and forest chiefs discussed the problems at a meeting before issuing the new orders.Kerala has the highest number of festival elephants in India – thought to be about 500. Action for Elephants UK (AfE) has branded the state “ground zero for elephant torture”, and has called their illegal treatment “the worst case of animal cruelty in the world”. The plight of the 150 captive elephants in neighbouring Tamil Nadu is feared to be just as bad.For the six-month festival season, they are forced to walk for miles in searing temperatures on hot, stinging tar roads and ridden into noisy processions with fireworks. Some are carted from one festival to another – up to hundreds of miles – while still chained. Animal advocates say elephants are sensitive, intelligent and sociable creatures and rarely survive the “unrelenting neglect and torture” for a natural life. In the past seven years, 350 captive elephants have died. Often the water they are given falls short of the large quantities they drink in the wild, and many die of severe intestinal blockages. Campaigners staged a protest outside the Indian High Commission in London, coinciding with prime minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Britain, pleading for abuses to be policed.They said lucrative insurance claims provide incentives for owners to neglect their animals.Colourful processions can mask animal suffering (Getty)But the New Indian Express was concerned about the effect on tourism of the publicity about the elephants’ plight, saying the protest outside the High Commission in London added injury to insult.“For the Kerala Tourism Department, it seems it is a case of one step forward, two steps back, while it is trying to brand and market the state as a paradise for holidaymakers,” the Express website said.“State tourism director P Bala Kiran said this is a very serious issue and it will have long-lasting impact on the tourism sector of the state if not addressed properly.”The Kerala Tourism Department has decided to make films of elephant care and majestic festivals featuring the culture and tradition of the state to counter the bad publicity, the paper reported.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

There, they will board a charter train to the nuclear test ground in an unhabitable deep mountain area, according to state media. North Korea\u0027s nuclear tests have taken place in Punggye-ri, a location in the northeastern part of North Korea where a system of tunnels have been dug under Mount Mantap. State media said the dismantling of the nuclear site would involve the collapsing of its tunnels with explosions, blocking its entrances and removing all observation facilities, research buildings and security posts. President Trump welcomed the announcement by North Korea\u0027s government. In a tweet, he called the move a very smart and gracious gesture. North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month, ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th. Thank you, a very smart and gracious gesture! he tweeted. The latest announcement comes after last month\u0027s landmark Panmunjom summit when Mr Kim suggested he would halt missile and nuclear tests ahead of his meeting with President Trump. South Korea\u0027s presidential office also welcomed the move, saying it showed North Korea\u0027s willingness to denuclearise through actions rather than just words. Despite progress being hailed from all sides, North Korea has given no indication it was willing to go beyond support for denuclearisation by unilaterally abandoning its nuclear weapons programme. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

The World Health Organisation has warned such pollution, much of which is from the fossil fuels that cause climate change, is a “public health emergency”.Water levels in reservoirs, like this one in Gers, France, have been getting perilously low in areas across the world affected by drought, forcing authorities to introduce water restrictions.Mr Van Gendt presented new figures about the Tesla battery’s performance, which also revealed it has now taken over 55 per cent of FCAS in the region.South Australia is now reportedly the only state that has experienced a decline in FCAS costs in recent months.Some estimates suggest the cost savings to consumers as a result of this decline have been up to A$35m (£19.5m) in the first four months of the Tesla battery’s operation.Lara Olsen, Tesla Energy’s regional manager of business development, also spoke at the event and explained that while other FCAS systems rely on volatile fuel costs, the wind power the battery relies on is fixed at a cheap and stable price.While local politicians in South Australia largely welcomed the giant battery as a key component in efforts to make the state more self-sufficient and provide affordable energy, there has been push back from the higher levels of government.Australian resources minister Matt Canavan even compared it to Kim Kardashian, stating that “it’s famous for being famous. It really doesn’t do very much.”Tesla’s new mega-battery in Australia responding in ‘record’ timeHowever, the success of the project has been recognised by the Australian Energy Market Operator, which has noted that it is capable of responding to outages much faster than conventional generators.South Australia has been hailed for the lead it has taken on renewable energy, with state Labour politicians lending their support to large scale developments including the world’s largest solar thermal plant. The Tesla battery is seen by experts as another jewel in the state’s green energy crown. To some extent the system’s efficiency has not been a positive thing for Tesla, which has stated that the speed of the battery is not being accounted for properly, resulting in the company missing out on payments.Nevertheless, its success has led to interest in further Tesla projects, with a solar-powered version set to be built in the Australian state of Victoria.While the Hornsdale Power Reserve battery currently holds the title of the world’s largest, Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently hinted at an even larger project set to be announced soon.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel.

The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel.

Scott might be 26 years her junior but he always strikes me as the “older” one in the relationship.It’s that sheer zest for life that Barbara has, even at 80, that makes this diagnosis so very sad and hard to bear.Scott decided to speak out because he felt he could no longer protect his beloved wife from people outside their close circle of friends and family hearing the truth.He became worried her illness would make her do or say something out of ­character that could upset her and others.He wants to be able to take his wife on ­ outings, and for her to still meet the public who love her and who will now ­hopefully understand if she’s having a “foggy” day.Scott also needs to make sure he takes care of himself and doesn’t get completely worn out looking after his wife.He hasn’t been able to leave her alone in the house recently, but now the truth is out he can let others take over while he at least has half an hour to himself.Anyone who cares for someone with dementia knows it is utterly exhausting, stressful and worrying, no matter how much you love them.I salute everyone who quietly and patiently deals with these day-to-day ­struggles. Scott is now free of the burden of keeping the secret and I hope he is finding strength from all of the messages of support for Barbara.She’s been part of many of our most-loved shows and we’ve grown up with “Our Babs”.I remember watching her wiggle and giggle her way through the Carry On films, where her sheer talent and perfect comic timing marked her out as a little superstar.Who could forget her enthusiastic arm flinging exercise routine in Carry On Camping that ended with her bra pinging off?And that incredible bikini made up of three shiny red hearts in Carry On Again Doctor made my pal Dr Hilary Jones decide to take up a career in medicine.As she more than proved during her reign in EastEnders, Barbara has always been so much more than a bubbly blonde dolly bird.She is one hell of an actress and was in her element behind the bar of The Queen Vic.It was her and Scott’s decision to kill off Peggy Mitchell when her memory began to fade.Barbara was having difficulty ­learning lines so felt she couldn’t give her very best performance.As it so happens, the scenes leading up to her character’s death were some of the best that ­Barbara, or any soap actress, has ever given on the small screen. Quite simply she is the real deal.I’ve been lucky enough to ­interview her many times over the years and it’s like catching up with an old friend.She’s open and honest and has never tried to cover up her ­mistakes or to sugar-coat the ups and downs of her life.When work was thin on the ground she painted on a smile, climbed into her shiny fairy godmother outfit and worked her backside off in provincial pantos.She was always quick to credit EastEnders for giving her a career comeback.I’ve seen her talking to fans outside the ­studio, always happy to pose for pictures, sign autographs and have a chat.She would leave everyone with a smile on their face and some happy memories.Her own powers of recall and her very bright light may be diminishing, but Scott and all her friends and family, and the public who adore her, will ensure she is wrapped in a soft blanket of love.She’s a class act and a very special woman.TAKE a bow Shayne Ward and all concerned with the deeply moving and hugely important storyline of Aidan’s suicide in Coronation Street.The subject was handled with great sensitivity.We saw Aidan feeling isolated and alone in the crowded Rovers, witnessed his fearful despair and heard his father’s anguished screams of grief through the closed bedroom door.There was no need to see his cold, dead body to understand what had happened. This really was Corrie at its finest.Richard Hawley as devastated dad Johnny and Catherine Tyldesley as poor bereaved Eva were exceptional, but what made me really blub was the authentic speech by Gail (Helen Worth) looking out of her window on to the iconic cobbled street, talking about how we all need to look after each other and that no one should suffer in silence.It was beautifully written and impeccably delivered.That’s what Corrie is all about.IT’S the one time of the year when our inevitable failure to win a massive trophy in Europe is a source of fun and amusement rather than humiliation. Because tonight is Eurovision.Our plucky Brit doomed to failure this time is SuRie, above, who is actually a good performer with a perfectly acceptable song, but even if the UK entry was Robbie Williams belting out Angels, we would still be near the bottom of the table or even doomed to the dreaded “nul points”.Many theories are put forward for our dire results over the past two decades.Some believe there are too many countries taking part (Australia and Israel are bizarrely considered part of Europe) which makes for more tactical voting, combined with an anti- British backlash made worse by Brexit.I reckon it’s simply because we don’t take it seriously enough, for which I’m very grateful, because I truly love Eurovision.We know we won’t win so it’s just an excuse for a party, a chance to wallow in the whole wonderful campfest and to chortle at Graham Norton’s snarky comments.My perfect evening.WHEN Kim Kardashian is the most elegant and tastefully dressed woman in the room, you know that something has gone horribly awry.So it was at the ludicrous Met Gala in New York, which saw a procession of show-offs dressing up like extras from the Monty Python sketch about the Spanish Inquisition.Madonna looked like Dracula’s mad old aunty, Sarah Jessica Parker had a nativity scene on her head, and don’t get me started on Rihanna, who came as some sort of sexy bishop mashed up with a pearly queen.It made Kim’s skin-tight gold sheath Versace dress appear to be the epitome of class.We are told the Pope approved this farrago, which was pompously entitled Heavenly Bodies: Fashion And The Catholic Imagination.His endorsement should make you shudder – until you realise that’s how he always dresses.He’s also a man with a passion for red leather Prada slip-ons, so I suppose he is more connected to the weird world of fashion than your average parish priest.A great deal of money is raised for good causes at this tacky celebration of fame and fortune, and that’s all well and good. But maybe next year they should stay at home and write a cheque.One thing is certain. You can be darned sure they won’t follow up the Catholic theme by making a mockery of Islam or Judaism.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which they are.The Sun is all for more grammar ­places so long as a generous proportion are guaranteed for children from low-income families — as they will be.We back more choice, smaller classes and higher standards. So does the nation.DONALD Trump has been given the usual kicking over Iran — but he may be right.Barack Obama’s dodgy deal freed the mullahs to spend billions spreading war and terrorism throughout Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza.Trump aims to halt that and punish the extremist regime. Who knows . . . maybe Iran’s people will finally revolt.Trump’s aggression and rash tweets have surprising upsides. He has helped propel North Korea towards peace.That’s more than Obama achieved during eight years of sonorous speeches which disguised dithering timidity.WHAT a surprise.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If Prince Harry and Meghan’s wedding is anything like our day it will be truly magical.“When we signed the register at The Guildhall we realised that we have become a part of Royal history - in just a few days time Harry and Meghan will sign the same one!“We couldn’t be happier or more grateful to the Sun on Sunday.”Delighted Natalie, a customer services rep, and Rich, who works in asset finance, said ‘I do’ in front of their loved ones on Friday.Their no-expense-spared prize wedding day cost in excess of £25,000 and included a lavish reception, vintage car, flowers, cake, rings, photographer, videographer and all the bridal outfits and suits. Every last detail was meticulously planned to ensure Rich and Natalie felt like a Prince and Princess and were treated to the wedding of their dreams, just eight days before Harry and Meghan marry next Saturday.And their big day meant even more to them, because Rich, 29, is a huge royal fan who met Princess Diana the day he was born.From a young age he would tell how, at less than two hours old, he was chosen for his meeting with Diana when she opened a maternity ward in the hospital where his mum Kath gave birth.He said: “My mum is so proud of meeting Princess Diana and shows that photograph to everyone.There has always been a royal connection for me, so to have been able to wed here in Windsor just a week before Prince Harry is brilliant.“This has been the best day of our lives, without a doubt. I know everyone says that about their wedding day, but this has been incredibly special.“Every detail was perfect and it all went to plan. Natalie looks beautiful and I’m so proud to call her my wife.“We can’t thank the Sun on Sunday enough. You’ve made us feel like royalty on the most important day of our lives.”Natalie, 24, added: “It has been a dream come true. We never would have been able to afford a wedding this beautiful and special. I know Meghan is getting married here next week, but today I feel like the Princess.”Rich and Natalie’s special day began at The Oakley Court Hotel - a stunning Victorian Mansion overlooking the River Thames with stunning grounds - where the bride and her bridesmaids had full hair and make up done.The stunning 1859 hotel, a stone’s throw from the Castle, can boast both King Edward VII and Napoleon IV as guests - and even played host to Harry’s Grandmother, HRH Queen Elizabeth in 2009.Portrait photographer Patrick Balls and videographers from Dom Balls Events were on hand to capture candid shots of the girls as they were pampered.There wasnt a dry eye as Natalies dad Mark, 51, saw her in her stunning wedding dress for the first time and proudly led his daughter to the 1939 Rolls-Royce Wraith called Victoria courtesy of Charismatic Cars that took them to The Guildhall in Royal Windsor town centre.Rich, his two best men and groomsmen - who were all kitted out in blue suits from Cookham Formal Hire and with button holes from Marks and Spencer - took selfies and giggled as they waited for Natalies big arrival.She looked beautiful as she slowly walked towards her happy groom with her attendants - bridesmaid Hannah Cawthray, 24, her nieces and flower girls Martha and India Pickering, aged six and one, and page boy Freddie Adamson, three - who were all dressed in beautiful outfits courtesy of Monsoon and Accessorize and carrying white and green bouquets from Marks and Spencer.The pair giggled before nervously holding hands and saying their vows in the same venue where Prince Charles wed Camilla in April 2005. The pair exchanged platinum wedding bands from Winsor Bishop Jewellers in a room lined with Royal portraits.And as the registrar declared them man and wife, Rich kissed a delighted Natalie and a ripple of applause rang around the room.Outside Royal fans, TV crews - from across the world - and locals applauded the pair and as they headed towards The Long Walk in front of Windsor Castle the couple waved at their new fans before returning to The Oakley Court Hotel as man and wife.The couple had a lavish reception courtesy of the hotel - with a Pimm’s reception and a BBQ feast that included burgers, tuna steaks, pork loin and salads.As the guests ate in the stretch marquee - with more stunning flowers from Marks and Spencer on the tables - singer Kelly Barnes performed.And it was there that the newlyweds met their VIP guests Harry and Meghan - lookalikes Rhys Whittock and Sarah Mhlanga, both 35.Rich laughed: “Now that they’ve been guests on our day we think they’ll return the favour and invite us to their big day!“It was great to meet them. A lot of heads turned to see them there with us. It was the icing on the cake for our day!”In his speech Rich praised his new bride adding: Natalie, you look stunning today, I love you so much and I always will. I know well have an amazing life together.The newlywed husband also took a moment to thank The Sun on Sunday adding: Were eternally grateful for everything thats been done for us.While Prince Harry will remember his mother Princess Diana on his big day this week, Rich also took a moment to remember his brother Barry, who also passed away in a car accident when he was just 23-years-old in 2004. Choking back tears Rich admitted how much he missed his big brother on the most memorable day of his life.He said: Baz was my best friend and I know hed have loved Natalie and looked after her, I know wed all give anything to have him here.The happy couple then cut their amazing cake from Marks and Spencer that included carrot, lemon, fruit and chocolate tiers.With all formalities out of the way, it was time to kick back, relax and let loose – just as Harry and Meghan will at their private reception at Frogmore House.The guests all headed to the hotels Windsor Suite and as the band ‘Get On Up’ started performing Rich and Natalie took to the floor for their first dance.Guests laughed, danced, drank and ate sausage and bacon baps until the early hours before the music wound down.Wedding planner Francesca Cook who organised the day and, together with her team of staff, made sure everything went without a hitch, said: “We were thrilled to plan and host the wedding - it was a truly special day.”Natalie’s mum Bridget, 56, said: “We have been excited ever since Natalie and Rich won the competition. Its been a wonderful day.And Natalie said: “I can’t stop smiling. I don’t want this night to end. I’m worn out but delighted - everything has been perfect.”And it was a perfect day when Rich was born at the Beverley Westwood Hospital, East Yorks, in 1988 and he was chosen to meet Princess Diana who was opening the ward that day.His mum, post lady Kath, now 61 and married to retired businessman Sam, 67, told us: “I instantly said yes! I love the Royals.“So to have my son now marry in a wedding fit for royalty, just before Harry and Meghan, is a dream. It’s been a perfect day.“Meeting Harry’s mother Princess Diana 29 years ago when Richard was less than two hours old is etched in our memories. We are very lucky to have these memories entwined in our lives.“Little did we know the day Richard was born would come full circle nearly 30 years later and now Richard and Natalie will have their own royal story to tell their children and grandchildren like we have. Rich, Natalie and The Sun on Sunday would like to thank:Additional reporting: Kelly Jenkins. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It takes an average of four months to deport each one.The Home Office put the rise down to improvements in identifying foreign criminals.It added: “Those who commit crimes in the UK should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them.“We have removed more than 41,000 since 2010.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She needs to solve the housing crisis.The number of people renting in their 30s, 40s, and 50s has nearly doubled in the past decade. Home ownership is at a 30-year low.The average home costs almost eight times average earnings, 11 in London.Brickies and nurses need six- figure deposits to get on the ladder.New Housing Secretary James Brokenshire needs to get radical to solve the issue.The Treasury should find the cash to unleash a building programme.Archaic planning laws need to be scrapped, too. The housing crisis cannot be fixed without building on some of the Green Belt.Construction firms who sit on land to keep supply low and prices high should also be fined to force them to build.The Government was right to slash stamp duty for first-time buyers, but it needs shaking up across the board. Cutting it would encourage older people to downsize and help families upsize.Most people under 40 are not socialists, just smitten by Jeremy Corbyn’s promise of freebies. They are aspirational hard-workers, who want a home to call their own. Many are the people Mrs May once called those “Just About Managing”.House reforms are vital for the future of the Tory Party. Next to Brexit, it is the most important thing for them to fix.Mrs May once said it was her mission to solve the housing crisis.Well, PM, what happened?SEXISM has no place in the workplace.Yet almost a third of women say they have been ordered to dress provocatively by bosses, against their wishes.The Government has issued guidelines to stamp this out.

And my experience in government reinforces my belief that we need to make sure that we deliver things at pace.”Elsewhere Mr Gove added to Cabinet tensions over Brexit after saying there were significant question marks over the customs partnership option favoured by the Prime Minister.His remarks came after a plea by Theresa May for unity as she insisted she could be trusted to deliver the Brexit people voted for.With the Cabinet split over which of two customs models to back, Environment Secretary Mr Gove said neither option being considered was perfect.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She lived and breathed those qualities from the second she woke in the morning till the moment her head hit the pillow. Her whole life she was dedicated to, and motivated by, the needs of others. Even in illness, she was determined to ally her sad fate to her profile and her position in Parliament, so she could fight and win for others with the same illness, but without the platform. She secured considerable extra funding for cancer care as a result. Politics to her was not some game - Cabinet on Brexit take note - but the means by which real challenges could be met, real people helped. Tessa saw the good in everyone. But she also saw the problems in their lives and wanted to help solve them. Her background before politics was in social work and mental health. She retained the passion required for those challenges in everything she did.  How my children react to our friends has always been important to me. Our three children adored Tessa. She was an enormous part of their lives, never forgot birthdays, loved meeting their friends, celebrating their successes. I remember one Halloween when she had promised to go trick or treating with our daughter Grace. There was a huge drama at Westminster and Tessa was at the heart of it. Grace was sure she would not turn up. She did. Grace was in bits on Saturday night when we got the news . But through the tears she said something that got to the heart of Tessa’s personality, and a quality that made her such an effective politician. She said she had never met anyone else with the quality Tessa had, to make whoever she was talking to feel like there was nowhere else they wanted to be at that time. Her smile and her positivity were infectious. It is said of some people that they’re ‘too nice for politics.’ Nobody ever said that of Tessa. But she was tough too, always calm and polite but very forceful when she needed to be. That mix of charm and compassion, steel and resilience, is what delivered one of the greatest events of recent times, London 2012 Tessa drove that whole process. She persuaded a Prime Minister unsure he needed another huge challenge in his intray, a reluctant Chancellor worried about costs, a less than enthusiastic Cabinet and government machine. That battle won, she set to leading the fight to beat Paris, then making the Games a success. As Seb Coe said yesterday, nobody deserves more credit than Tessa for London 2012.

The highly-addictive drug, also known as ice, and a pipe to smoke it with were discovered by security guards in a disabled loo. It was the third such incident in six months at the Home Office, which is responsible for overseeing the nationwide war on drug abuse. Yet Scotland Yard decided not to mount a full investigation – with Government officials unable to say why. The embarrassing revelation came on the same day Mr Javid, who took over after Amber Rudd resigned a fortnight ago, tweeted a picture of himself with a Border Force officer and a sniffer dog called Trigger at Heathrow Airport. He posted: “We have impressive four-legged friends helping sniff out drugs, cash and illicit goods. Go Trigger!” Crystal meth, which featured in cult US television drama Breaking Bad, carries severe penalties for its use.  The stash of it was found on May 3 at the Home Office’s Marsham Street HQ in London’s Whitehall, where 5,000 staff are employed. An insider said: “Everyone in the building is talking about this. “We’re the lead department in the war against illegal drugs so it’s hugely embarrassing when they’re found under our noses. “Our job is to break the bad guys. not to feature in an episode of Breaking Bad.” In December last year crystal meth and a pipe were also found in a different Home Office disabled toilet. And last month cocaine was discovered elsewhere in the building. Security is tight at the Home Office, which is also responsible for co-ordinating the battle against terrorism. Visitors must go through a rigorous security system which involves body and bag scans and being sniffed by automatic devices for bombs. But staff have passes which allow them entry through automatic gates and their bags are not searched. The Home Office shares the building with Defra and Housing staff but all the drug finds occurred at its end of the premises. Buying drugs from a dealer could lay any user wide open to blackmail.  Tonight the Home Office was unable to say why the police are not investigating further. A spokeswoman told the Sunday Mirror: “We take incidents of this nature extremely seriously.” But Shadow police minister Louise Haigh said: “The Tories can’t even run their own Whitehall departments, let alone the country. With 21,000 fewer police on the beat thanks to Tory cuts, it’s crystal clear it’s time for change.” The discovery came hot on the heels of Ms Rudd quitting as Home Secretary in the Windrush immigration row. Mr Javid, formerly the Communities Secretary, walked into the Home Office on Monday, April 30 and the drugs were found on the following Thursday.

If followed through, the move would abolish civil partnerships for gay couples instead of extending them to everyone - as campaigners are demanding at the Supreme Court. Activists have been locked in a stand-off with the government since gay marriage became legal in 2014. At the moment, same-sex couples can choose between having a civil partnership - which pre-date gay marriage - or a wedding. But opposite-sex couples can only have marriage, which campaigners say is a loaded institution that not everyone wants. Tomorrow Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan will bring their fight to have a civil partnership to the Supreme Court.  Now, however, it has emerged the government is looking at the possibility of scrapping partnerships altogether. A paper slipped onto the government website last week warns civil partnerships have seen a significant decline from 6,305 a year to just 890 in 2016. The paper says officials will undertake research with current civil partners to better understand their views. Officials will also analyse more up-to-date data next summer to decide whether to phase out or abolish civil partnerships.  Any decision would not happen before 2020. The paper says: We want to understand why some same-sex couples continue to opt for civil partnership instead of marriage.

However, there\u0027s a mini-heatwave forecast tomorrow and Tuesday, with highs of up to 25C, before things stay cooler and dry for the rest of next week.  Next weekend, however, forecasters said temperatures will start to pick up again as heat blows in from France.

Father-of-six Neil Whitfield, 60, claims heavy mobile phone use in the late 1990s caused a deadly growth.  His job meant using a phone for long spells – and in the days before it was illegal he had the gadget pressed to his ear while driving. Neil developed an acoustic neuroma tumour on a nerve between his inner ear and brain. He was left deaf in one ear after surgery in 2001 to remove a growth the size of a golf ball. He also suffers with balance problems.  Neil said: “I have no doubt my tumour was caused by mobile phones. “I spent almost five years glued to my phone hours at a time until I was diagnosed. I could feel the heat coming off it. “I know this is going to be a real David and Goliath battle. It might take a while before it’s settled but I won’t give up. “This is for the future of my children and kids everywhere.” Neil is the first Brit to sue a mobile phone company on these grounds and the case – six years in the making – could trigger hundreds of similar claims.  His battle for “significant” \u0026shycompensation comes as a controversial report alleges cell phones could be behind a surge in certain tumours. Solicitor Katrina Pope, of London Corporate Legal, in Mayfair, expects to make a “strong claim” by the end of 2018. Katrina, who has been working unpaid on the case since 2012, said: “A win in the High Court could set a legal precedent for other cases which we are aware of and that are watching our progress. “It is ultimately about justice for many people who have, akin to Neil, been victims of what some experts describe as the ‘smoking gun of the 21st century’.  “Neil’s personal injury claim is outside the legal time frame of three years. We argue it’s only now that the technology exists for radiation testing to allow us to bring the case – the first in Britain.” Millions of Brits used Nokia phones in the 1990s. In 1995 just seven per cent of Brits had a cell phone but by 1999 one was sold every four seconds – and Nokia was the biggest manufacturer of mobiles. Figures published last week show cases of a brain tumour called glioblastoma in England rose from 983 to 2,531 between 1995 and 2015. It is found in the forehead and side regions of the brain. And a study in the Journal of Public Health and Environment found higher rates of tumours in the frontal \u0026shytem-poral lobe which “raises the suspicion mobile and cordless phone use may be promoting gliomas”.  Neil, from Wigan, Gtr Manchester, had to give up his job as a construction material salesman because he refused to carry on using mobiles. His claim centres around years of lost income and reduced \u0026shyretirement payments after a \u0026pound20,000-a-year drop in pay to become a college lecturer. Katrina added: “It is quite possible that a claim for life-changing damages such as Neil’s could achieve a compensation award in the region of \u0026pound1million.” The law firm has commissioned experts to carry out radiation tests on Nokia phones used by Neil, including the 5510. Katrina said: “The evidence is being collated.”  The surgeon who removed Neil’s tumour at Manchester’s Royal \u0026shyInfirmary, Professor Shakeel Saeed, said of the case: “At a personal level one cannot rule out the risk based on the current evidence.” The debate over possible hazards has raged for 20 years. Scientific studies have mostly concluded they pose no peril at the level of most people’s use. One expert backing Neil, Dr Erica Mallery-Blythe, specialises in conditions related to radio frequency \u0026shyradiation and other \u0026shyelectromagnetic fields. She cited a study by the American National Toxicology Program, which she said demonstrated “clear evidence” of \u0026shyschwannoma – tumours of nerve sheath – after testing mobile phone radiation on rats. Occupational and environmental consultant Colin Purnell said older phones held a greater risk because there were fewer masts in the 1990s and mobiles had to emit greater radiation levels to pick up signals.  Cancer Research moved to quell panic, saying there is no conclusive evidence that mobiles cause problems. Dr Lion Shahab, senior lecturer in \u0026shyepidemiology and public health at \u0026shyUniversity College London, said: “Many environmental and lifestyle factors have changed. While there has been a rise in this type of tumour, it would be premature to conclude this is due to mobile phones.” While experts are divided on the risks, Neil, meanwhile, told how his life has been greatly affected. He said: “I can’t even wear a hearing aid because all my inner ear organs had to be removed. “If I go swimming and close my eyes I go round in circles. I loved music but I’ve been robbed of that too because the stereo element has been taken away.  “My youngest son Harry, 13, is desperate for a mobile but I worry about giving him one. Companies should at least put \u0026shywarnings on packaging so people can make informed choices. I just hope the legal action makes a change for the good.” Last night Nokia said safety “has always been a key consideration”. A spokesman said: “All products comply with \u0026shyinternational exposure guidelines and limits that are set by public health \u0026shyauthorities. “The World Health \u0026shyOrganisation factsheet states that ‘A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been \u0026shyestablished for mobile phone use’.”  More radiation as old phones found a signal Experts claim old mobile phones carried a greater health risk than modern units as they produced greater radiation to receive signals. Colin Purnell, an environmental consultant, says early models had to emit more radiofrequency to connect with fewer masts available in the 1990s. He said: “If you are looking at something in the distance and you can’t see it you might want to use a pair of binoculars to improve the power of your eyes. “Well, it’s the same with mobile phones. In the old days there weren’t as many masts as now and if you operated your phone in a bad signal area it chucked out more radiation to find the power base. The risk associated with mobile phone use now is probably less then in the ’90s. “There are more masts and the technology is better to detect signals without a lot of radiation.” He said the way people use their phones today – using texts or Skype – also reduces the risk because it keeps phones away from the face.

Hannah Gilbert said she suddenly transformed into a different person for three weeks every month from the age of 14. She said her brother and sister were scared of her and her behaviour became so bad when she got to 16 that her exasperated family kicked her out. When she moved back a year later, she had an explosive row with her dad and the day after he had a heart and died - something she blamed herself for for years. But Hannah has only been given an official diagnosis for her condition in recent years. Few people know about PMDD - pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder but it affects one in 20 women in Britain. Only one in 50 are diagnosed with the condition despite its ability to ruin lives.  During her heartbreaking battle with the disorder she said she tried to take her life on more than one occasion and she left her husband Sam \u0027feeling like he\u0027s walking on eggshells\u0027. Writing in the Bristol Post , Hannah explained how PMDD has affected her life in her own words...   Writing this, telling my story, has to be one of the hardest things. I want you to know that whatever happens you are not alone, and just because I’m writing this, it doesn’t mean you will have it, but there maybe a possibility, and that’s ok. Pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder is an illness that effects one in 20 women in the UK. Thirty per cent of women in the world have it, 15 per cent of women who suffer, end up self-harming or committing suicide and sadly only two per cent of women get diagnosed. It’s not just about my periods. It is so much more - I wish it was PMS and \u0027Aunt Flow\u0027, out-staying her welcome! It turns out, PMDD sufferers have an anomaly in their gene activity that triggers more sensitivity to estrogen and progesterone, which leads to more intense pre-menstrual symptoms. My symptoms are so severe it stops me having a normal life. There is no worse feeling than living a life, feeling normal, then one day when your body changes and you first start your journey into womanhood, you get robbed. You\u0027re robbed of an experience because you are suddenly hit with so many emotions: Intense anger for no reason, depression and extreme anxiety, insomnia and vivid dreams. You feel that you have stepped into the pages of Jekyll and Hyde, that you are now living this life. You become two people: The normal you that pops up for only one week of a month, this person then hides away in the shadows of the other one - that hormonal b***h that you wish would go away, the one you can’t control and don’t understand why all this has happened. I want you to know that I understand, I will be there and I will support you. I spent most of my periods in the school nurse\u0027s office, crying in pain from the severe cramps and feeling like a freak. I used to pour my heart out to my mum, saying I hated who I was becoming.  I used to pray to God to end my suffering because the pain was unbearable. My brother and sister were afraid of me, they never knew when I would lose my temper and have an episode. I loathed who I was for three weeks of the month. I went to the doctor\u0027s crying for help and my mum came along for support. I was told it was just behavioural and that I would grow out of it. My schooling became effected, but my mum and dad never gave up: They made sure I had tutors to help me, so I could have an education. When I was 16, I was thrown out of my home, I was too dangerous and my moods to unpredictable. Homeless, I moved in with friends. I sofa surfed until a year later, I moved back home. Then on March 16, 2004, I had a huge episode and had a massive argument with my dad. He died the next day from a heart attack and I never got to say sorry, I blamed myself for many years for his death. I was left feeling so dark in myself and that there was something wrong with me and had no hope. I made a few attempts on my life, I self-harmed and I couldn’t stand the weight I would pile on, so I developed an eating disorder. My family and my friends helped me through a lot of this over the years. I never truly spoke about what was going on. How could I say, \u0027for one week I’m normal and then I feel for three weeks that I really can’t function and have no control\u0027? I’m at my worst a week before and after my period. I just sounded crazy and like I was picking and choosing when I was going to be unwell. For years I went backwards and forwards to my doctor, I was given all diagnoses, no medication was effective and I gave up hope with medical professionals. But she said she felt a huge change when she met her husband Sam. We have been on and off for many years. I’m very lucky as most women I meet who have PMDD have failed relationships. He is very patient, but we do have our problems - our relationship has been pushed a lot because of me. He has always known it wasn’t me, but felt that there is two people in our relationship: He loves me but hates the other one. He has told me he struggles and feels that he is always walking on egg-shells, afraid that whatever he says can trigger me. Over the years, I found ways of coping, throwing myself into work and my hobbies. I loved crafting and needed a creative outlet.  It’s horrible to feel that the people closest to you are the ones that are the worst affected. This was most tested when I had my first child Austin. For so many years I put off having children, mainly fear of birth and fear of me. I was once told labour is like your worst period pain, times that by ten. If my pains were anything to go by, no thank you. Sam also spoke to me about feeling scared of what I might have been like pregnant. The craziest thing happened though when I was pregnant. For the first time in 15 years, I felt normal throughout my pregnancy and for the first six months after having my son. Sam told everyone we meet: \u0027she hasn’t been crazy, she has been so normal!\u0027 It all stopped when I stopped breast-feeding and my periods came back. Trouble really came knocking. My periods didn’t come back like before I had Austin. No, they came back like when I was 14. The depression, feeling so hopeless and manic was scary. Worse, when you are a first time mum and you want to protect your child, but how do you protect them from you? Especially when you are their mum? There is no baby books that can explain me, my baby and my hormones. There was no help. The doctors tried labelling me with postnatal depression. The health visitor was advising me I was depressed. I wanted to pull my hair out and scream. The love I had for my son, I knew there was no way I was depressed, I had so much love for Austin and the connection I had. It broke me to think otherwise. I did question myself and I began to crumble very rapidly. Not being listened to, or people not having the answers because of lack of awareness, is the most detrimental thing when you have PMDD. On one of my darkest days, I found an article about PMDD. It was me, it was how I felt. The only people who listened to me, was Sam, my mum and an extremely supportive manager at work. Through their support I went about getting help. I went back to my doctors, but they dismissed what I was saying and said it was mental health and I was depressed. In the end I paid privately. I saw a wonderful consultant - she knew instantly that it was PMDD and got me on Evorel patches, twice a week. She suggested that I tried the chemical coil, and changed my diet, no more carbs and sugar.

Despite salaries of up to \u0026pound140,000, many don\u0027t fulfil their young dream due to fierce competition, gruelling training and steep price-tag of up to \u0026pound100,00 for training. But now the sky is literally the limit for Steafan, who says his hard work was tough at times, but has certainly paid off.  He graduated from the aviation and airline pilot academy, FTE Jerez, in Spain this week, reports Belfast Live .  And his first solo flight was a mix of freedom, terrifying and exciting.  We were flying Aer Lingus to America as a child and the captain invited me into the cockpit and that was it, he said. Ever since then it has been my dream to fly for the national carrier. My parents prepared for it, it was always in the back of their minds because I never waivered in what I wanted to do. Steafan said his dad and grandfather drove him to Dublin to use flight simulators and to watch the planes take off throughout his childhood, while his parents saved to fund his €117,000 course.  He added: I realise how fortunate I am that they put me through the training. It was not easy and it took me a full year to pass my medical. I am an only child and once I got onto the course it meant leaving home at 19 for Spain. The work was extremely tough and although it was not more difficult than A-Levels, there was a much greater quantity of things to learn.

A quarter of adults don’t think it matters if their kids develop cavities in their baby teeth, and admit to a lack of knowledge about oral health in children. And nearly a third of parents in the UK wait until their children have all their milk teeth before taking them to the dentist for the first time, according to the study of 1,000 parents with kids under 13. Nyree Whitely, the Group Clinical Director for mydentist, which commissioned the research ahead of Smile Month, said: “There is a common misconception that baby teeth do not matter. “But the truth is that they are essential for speech, the structure of the face and holding space for the adult teeth to erupt into. If there is decay it can lead to infection, discomfort and potentially damage the permanent teeth below.”  “It is essential that parents regularly take their children to the dentist as soon as their baby has their first tooth or turns one – whichever is sooner. “Children’s appointments are free and where appropriate include a fluoride varnish treatment that can help protect against decay.” More than half of parents in the UK stop helping their children brush their teeth too early, and two thirds had no idea what kind of toothbrush their child should be using. Parents also admit to confusion over fluoride in toothpaste, with half saying they don’t check or wouldn’t know how much should be in their toothpaste. One in 10 parents would happily give their child a drink of fruit juice after brushing their teeth and before going to bed. And almost a third would happily give their young ones a glass of milk before bed, which is now understood to be a cause of tooth decay due to the natural sugars it contains – especially after teeth-brushing time. Nyree Whitely said: “It can be hard for parents to find the right advice on children’s oral health which is why we also give parents tips on brushing. Helping children have good brushing technique can help set them up for a lifetime of good oral hygiene.” "},{"url":null,"title":"party looks over club 18","story":"NewsParty looks over for Club 18-30 holidays after 50 years as millennials opt for Instagram-friendly tripsAt its peak, Club 18-30 catered for 100,000 revellers a year at destinations including Malia, Ayia Napa and Magaluf - and spawned the notorious TV series Club Reps\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAmy-Clare Martin21:51, 13 MAY 2018NewsThomas Cook could be ending their iconic \u0027sun, sex and party\u0027 brand Club 18-30\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThomas Cook could end its iconic “sun, sex and party” Club 18-30 holidays.

Jim Ratcliffe, 65, chief executive of Ineos, topped the Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of \u0026pound21.05 billion, leapfrogging his way from 18th place year.  Mr Ratcliffe, whose firm is currently locked in a legal battle with the Scottish government over its moratorium on fracking, emerged in pole position after additional details led to a substantial revaluation of his assets. The Sunday Times has previously described him as publicity shy.  Ineos\u0027s director Andy Currie and finance director John Reece shared in his fortunes, joining Ratcliffe in the top 20, taking joint 16th place with fortunes of \u0026pound7 billion each. At second place were the Hinduja brothers, Sri and Gopi, worth \u0026pound20.64 billion.  Their fortune jumped by \u0026pound4.44 billion on 2017, with their India-based car manufacturer Ashok Leyland and Mumbai-based IndusInd Bank having a particularly successful year. British-American industrialist-turned-media mogul Sir Len Blavatnik came in third place with \u0026pound15.26 billion to his name.  The 60-year-old was knighted this year for services to philanthropy - recent donations include \u0026pound50 million to fund the Tate Modern\u0027s new wing, and \u0026pound5 million towards the Victoria and Albert Museum\u0027s new entrance, as well as funding the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University. This year is the 30th anniversary of the Rich List, with the top 20 now worth a combined \u0026pound218.6 billion - increasing their cumulative wealth by \u0026pound33. 5 billion in the last year. Of the 1,000 people on the list, 145 are billionaires. There are now 141 women on the list, with Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken of the brewing dynasty ranked highest at number six.  She and her financier husband Michel de Carvalho - vice chairman of Citigroup - increased their wealth by almost 20% over the past year to \u0026pound11.1 billion. Elsewhere, Arcadia boss Sir Philip Green\u0027s fortune took a tumble - his reputation was dragged through the mud following the collapse of BHS after he sold it to a man twice declared bankrupt for just \u0026pound1.  It later emerged that the department store\u0027s two pension schemes had a combined shortfall of \u0026pound571 million, risking the future of their 19,000 members and prompting MPs to call Sir Philip to give evidence in front of a parliamentary select committee. Falling sales at his flagship brands Topshop and Miss Selfridge as well as his promise to contribute \u0026pound363 million towards the pension deficit led to Sir Philip\u0027s fortune dropping by \u0026pound787 million to \u0026pound2 billion. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver exited the list completely following a rocky year for his eponymous restaurant empire - it is still undergoing restructuring after racking up debts of more than \u0026pound70 million.  In January the chain announced 12 of its 37 branches were to close. Financier Ernesto Bertarelli and his wife Kirsty saw the biggest decrease in wealth, losing \u0026pound1.48 billion due to falls in Ernesto\u0027s pharmaceutical company stakes, the list\u0027s author said. The couple are now 11th on the list.  Aristocrat Hugh Grosvenor is still the UK\u0027s youngest billionaire at the age of 27 having inherited his fortune and his title - 7th duke of Westminster - following the death of his father two years ago. His property empire includes 300 acres in Mayfair and Belgravia, as well as properties in Oxford, Cheshire, Scotland and Spain.

A female shopper was also reportedly knocked unconscious as one of the males involved tried to flee the violence. The pregnant shop worker, who did not want to be named, said she saw the alleged victim run into a queue for Burger King, at the Eat Central food court at around 1pm.  She told Birmingham Live : It was just awful and it all happened so quickly.  I was on my lunch break at work and I was in Eat Central when I suddenly saw a boy run into the Burger King queue. The lad shoved his way through the customers and it seemed as if he was trying to get away from someone.  Did you see the the incident? Email webnews@trinitymirror       I remember feeling a bit uneasy at that point because I am pregnant. Then another lad appeared, who seemed to have been chasing him, with a hammer in his hand. The lad with the hammer then hit the lad who ran into the queue, in the face. By this time, there was a lady unconscious on the floor, after she had been knocked over in the queue. People were trying to help this lady and there was so much going on. It was hard to see how many people were involved in this because the food court was so busy with customers but it seemed to me as if there were two gangs. The guy who had been hit in the face ran off towards the cash machines but was being chased and was hit by a guy with the hammer, again in the face.

Therapy Dogs could be a regular sight on wards and boost the mental welfare of patients. The first ever NHS animal protocol will be unveiled on Monday at the Royal College of Nursing’s annual \u0026shyconference in Belfast. The college is calling for all-out bans on animals in hospitals to be lifted as the sick are missing out. Charity Pets as Therapy offers highly trained animals to schools and care homes and is poised to expand in to the NHS. The system is being pioneered with dogs Leo and Lottie at \u0026shySouthampton General Hospital.  Leo’s owner Lyndsey Uglow said: “There’s no way the NHS would pay for this but these dogs are a free volunteer workforce. “In the US there are a lot more animal interventions and we are only now catching up. When you walk on to the ward there’s always a gasp and the children love it. “We enjoy doing it and the reward you get is seeing the reaction of the patients and the dogs enjoying it.” Leo is specially trained to support children and has helped many with cancers and serious brain conditions.  Rules on access are made by \u0026shyindividual trusts and a small number allow “petting” animals on \u0026shychildren’s wards but dogs are banned from most hospitals. The RCN protocol covers medical alert dogs which can be trained to constantly monitor their owner’s health condition and alert to impending episodes. Others have undergone training as autism assistance dogs and supporting mental health patients.

She\u0027s wild and fun, and no evening bash is really complete without her, so friends are surprised she hasn\u0027t been invited.  Chelsy is surprised too, shocked in fact, and a little hurt. A source also told Vanity Fair that she was still holding out hope that she may get an invite at a later date. They said: Chelsy has been telling everyone she has been invited to the wedding and she is shopping for the perfect gown. “She wants to look her very best and has been given a plus-one, but she has said she has not been invited to the evening party.

Bethan Davies and Robert Jesty had been held by armed bandits since Friday after an ambush, during which a ranger was killed. A statement released on behalf of the pair said: “We are very relieved that there has been a positive outcome to the kidnapping and are very grateful for the excellent support we have received.  We do not plan to comment further.” The Foreign Office announced earlier today that the pair were freed today, although circumstances around their release have not been revealed. They were kidnapped in the Virunga National Park, which borders Rwanda, in an attack which claimed the life of Rachel Makissa Baraka. Their driver, who has also been freed, was injured during the attack in the famous gorilla park - but his condition is not yet known.  It had earlier been reported that elite SAS soldiers were dispatched to the Democratic Republic of Congo to help efforts to free the hostages. The Britons and the Congolese driver are all receiving support and medical attention, officials in DRC confirmed. In a statement Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: “I am delighted to announce that two British nationals who were held hostage in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been released. I pay tribute to the DRC authorities and the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation for their tireless help during this terrible case.    My thoughts are now with the family of Virunga Park ranger Rachel Makissa Baraka who was killed during the kidnapping, and with the injured driver and the released British nationals as they recover from this traumatic incident.” Cosma Wilungula, director general of The Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation, said: “We would like to thank our brave team for ensuring the swift resolution of this incident, and the safe return of the two British nationals.” Park Director Emmanuel de Merode said: “We are deeply saddened by the death of Virunga National Park Ranger Baraka, whose life was tragically cut short whilst protecting the passengers and driver. We wish to extend our deepest condolences to her family and our sincerest gratitude for her bravery and service to Congo. We would like to thank the UK government for their support with this issue.”    The kidnappers had reportedly demanded \u0026pound150,000 in ransom for the pair\u0027s release. The circumstances around their release have yet to be clarified. The British ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo, John Murton, said: The UK would like to thank the DRC authorities and MONUSCO (The United Nations peace keeping mission) for their assistance in resolving this kidnapping. I would like in particular to praise the courage and commitment shown by the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation and the Virunga Park authorities over the past three days. My deepest condolences are with the family, friends and colleagues of Rachel Makisa Baraka, the Virunga ranger killed during the kidnapping.  I wish the driver injured during the incident a speedy recovery. The bravery and determination of all the staff of Virunga is vital for the conservation of animals in the park, and the protection of local communities. The 25-year-old ranger was a so-called ‘ecoguard’ providing security on a convoy travelling through the Virunga National Park, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on Friday morning. She became the first female ranger in the bloody history of the park to be murdered by bandits. Fellow park rangers confirmed that Rachel was ‘a devoted conservationist who died in the line of duty’. One added: Her only thought would have been the safety and security of visitors to the park who were on the convoy. Virunga National Park - spanning 3,011 miles - is located in DRC’s unstable North Kivu province. It faces multiple threats from rebel groups, local bandits and the self-defence MaiMai militia partly due to its hugely lucrative charcoal industry, for which the trees of the park are the principal raw material. It is also home to one of the world’s largest populations of critically endangered mountain gorillas as well as hundreds of other rare species. In April five rangers aged between 22 and 30 were killed in an attack from a group that officials believe belong to Mai Mai militia. However, the DRC as a whole has faced growing violence recently, with authorities advising Brits avoid numerous areas across the country. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice The FCO advise against all travel to the provinces of Kasa\u0026iuml, Kasa\u0026iuml Central, Kasa\u0026iuml Oriental, Haut-Uele, Haut Lomami, Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu, Maniema and Tanganyika, areas to the west and east of Kananga including Tshikapa and Mwene-Ditu (as shown on the map), and within 50km of the border with the Central African Republic and South Sudan. The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the cities of Goma and Bukavu and to the districts of N’djili and Kimbanseke in Kinshasa. In 2017, there has been an increase in military and police stop-and-search checkpoints in parts of Kinshasa, especially after dark. Since July 2017, there have been increased reports of several towns in the South Kivu province of eastern DRC being attacked by or having come under the control of armed groups.

We were both only 18 and we didn’t have the money for that.“The ceremony took place at 8.30am because it was the day of the students’ charity event when they would decorate floats and parade them around the city so all the streets were closing.“After the wedding ceremony, we went back to my mum and dad’s house for a small wedding breakfast before heading to the Palace Theatre and then the carnival.“On our wedding night we went home and our best man, my cousin David Cunningham, made us stovies.“It wasn’t a grand day and we definitely couldn’t afford a honeymoon but it was fantastic.“Although all the pictures are black and white, I remember John’s suit being a powder blue colour.”In the image seen here, the young girl gifting the happy couple a traditional horseshoe is Mary’s cousin June Kay, who is now 66 herself.Mary, a retired teacher, and John, a retired roofer, have two sons, Stephen and John, as well as six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.It was one of their grandchildren who inspired Mary’s gift to John for their diamond anniversary.Mary said: “My granddaughter had asked why John never wore a wedding ring and the answer was he never had one to wear!“We were lucky to have been able to buy my wedding ring but John never got one.“For my gift to him this year, I bought him a gold wedding band which he now wears.“He bought me a dozen yellow roses but was shocked at the price of 12 flowers!”During their anniversary celebrations, the couple were visited at their Broughty Ferry home by Lord Provost Ian Borthwick who presented them with a bouquet of flowers and they also received a card of congratulation from the Queen.John said: “It has been 60 good years of happiness, laughter and banter.

I still wanted her to be able to go on her walks, but I realised she could do with a little bit of help.“I had seen something similar to the doggy buggy when I was on holiday and decided to see if I could find something like it to help Aime out.“I went online and I got this doggy buggy.“It’s only just arrived, but when I put Aime in it she took to it like a duck to water.“She was happy to sit in it and looked as proud as punch sitting there.“I pushed her up and down the hall a bit and she was absolutely happy.“We haven’t been out in it yet but I’m quite sure it will be perfect for her.“She will be able to walk as far as she likes then I can pop her in the buggy and she can finish our walk in comfort.“I, too, suffer a little bit from arthritis, so the buggy is going to have the added benefit of giving me a little bit of support while out on a walk.“I can sometimes struggle a bit as well but by pushing the buggy I get support too, so it’s ideal both for Aime and me.”Jessie said other people are already beginning to ask her about the buggy.She said: “I found it quite easily and I’ve been told they are quite popular in America.“If it gives other people an idea of how to help out their beloved dog if it’s older or struggles while out walking, then I’ll be very happy.“Fingers crossed it’s a success.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af564f13d539.jpg ","title":"fashionistas get style advice at the overgate","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Overgate’s style studio was bang on trend as it hosted a special event as part of Dundee Fashion Week.Shoppers received pointers from two local fashion bloggers and were even given free eyelash extensions at yesterday’s one-off event.It saw shoppers browse must-have fashion staples for men and women from retailers including Debenhams, Topshop, River Island, New Look, Superdry, Topman, Oasis, Next and Quiz.The two women behind fashion blog Wardrobe Conversation, Helen Macdonald and Kimberley Grahame, were there to help those in need of style guidance.Helen said: “Helping style women is something we do all the time and it is really nice to be able to give out some advice.

That will rise to \u0026pound42.5 million next year and \u0026pound45.3 million in 2020-21.It is desperately needed, according to those in the front line facing daily calls from struggling Highlanders.Alasdair Christie, manager of the Citizens Advice Bureau in Inverness, Badenoch and Strathspey, said: \u0026ldquoWe see more and more people struggling to be able to afford a home or maintain tenancies.\u0026ldquoA lot of it is down to the fact that they simply don\u0026rsquot have the income to cover the cost of rent and associated living expenses, and the demand greatly outweighs the supply of housing available.\u0026ldquoThe emphasis has to be on more council and housing association rented properties being available.According to Scottish Government statistics, almost 72,500 affordable homes have been added since 2007.Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said affordability was \u0026ldquoabout more than just bricks and mortar, by providing \u0026ldquosafe, warm homes.He said the government was on target to deliver at least 50,000 homes during this parliament through \u0026pound3 billion of investment, of which 35 percent would be for social rent.He is working with councils and housing associations \u0026ldquoto deliver quality homes to meet local needs.Labour regional MSP David Stewart welcomed the extra funding but wants an assurance that the right kind of property is being built.He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod invest more in good quality council and social housing, with a mixture of home types, ensuring these options were attractive and available to help relieve the pressure so many young people feel about home ownership.Sunday 13 May 2018 10:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04092000/04092368.jpg","title":"Demand for tougher A82 safety measures","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCampaigners have warned that pedestrians or cyclists could die unnecessarily because there is currently only one set of traffic lights on the entire, busy stretch between the West Link and the Ness Bridge \u0026ndash at the Kenneth Street junction.Despite years of community pressure for safer crossings, a lengthy review by roads agency Transport Scotland has concluded that cosmetic change is ample.It has pinpointed several locations for more prominent road islands, road redesign and new signposts. The details were aired at a meeting with ward councillors.Inverness West SNP councillor Bill Boyd, Ballifeary Community Council chairwoman Zosia Fraser and Murdo Campbell, who owns Loanfern Guest House in Glenurquhart Road, consider the response inadequate.The agency was praised by Cllr Boyd and ward colleague Graham Ross for listening and a public consultation will follow in the next few months.But Mrs Fraser said: \u0026ldquoFrankly, are we waiting for someone to be killed or seriously injured on Glenurqhart Road?\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove seen kids trying to get across the road to the Co-op, to stock up for the day, and they\u0026rsquore taking their life in their hands to get across that road.

Glenurquhart Road is busy with very dangerous crossroads.\u0026ldquoThe new (West Link) bridge has taken a lot of traffic off the road but that\u0027 made it faster because the traffic now moves more freely. There\u0027 a greater risk of accidents.Agency representatives acknowledged that there had been one fatal accident involving a pedestrian and 14 other collisions \u0026ndash three of them \u0026ldquoserious \u0026ndash involving pedestrians or cyclists along the city stretch of A82 between 2013 and 2017.The proposed upgrades would be in Longman Road, Kenneth Street, the Tomnahurich Street-Planefield Road junction, the Glenurquhart Road-Park Ro-ad-Bishops Road junction, and at the West Link roundabout.The agency envisages \u0026ldquowidened pavements and islands to shorten the crossing distance at various locations, additional pedestrian crossing facilities at the A82 Kenneth Street-Tomnahurich Street junction signals and a shared footway and cycleway facility between Longman and Telford roundabouts.A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll present draft options to the public at an information day where we\u0026rsquoll seek their feedback.Cllr Boyd said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll keep the pressure on.Sunday 13 May 2018 10:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04008000/04008297.jpg","title":"Former Black Isle school up for sale","story":"A FORMER Black Isle school has been put on the market and touted as a development opportunity with a variety of possible uses.Highland Council describes the sale of the former Newhall Primary and associated schoolhouse as \u0026ldquoa rare opportunity.It is on the market with offers in excess of \u0026pound110,000 being invited.The school, which includes a number of single-story extensions, dates back to around the turn of the 19th century and is predominantly of a stone construction with a slate-clad roof.The property is entered in the 2017 valuation roll as a primary school with a rateable value of \u0026pound6500.Highland Council says in its sale particulars that the property \u0026ldquoas a whole may lend itself to many alternative uses but notes that it has retained the former playing field to the west of it and will be reserving utility rights of passage through the former school property to facilitate connection to main utility supplies.The former schoolhouse provides accommodation over two levels.A closing date of May 9 has been set.Sunday 13 May 2018 10:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04003000/04003573.jpg","title":"Help offered to Highland Council is the business","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspInverness Chamber of Commerce has offered to host a summit on the key issues.The invitation follows a rallying call for the public to \u0026ldquohelp themselves by lobbying MPs and MSPs on the council\u0027 behalf, to highlight the need for extra revenue to protect and strengthen services.The independent-led minority administration also urged anyone with novel ideas for boosting the local authority\u0027 finances to make contact.The Scottish Government disputes it, but council convener Bill Lobban insists that council funding has been \u0026ldquocut, in real terms, by 9.6 percent since 2010.Administration leaders are preparing a document for Scottish Government ministers explaining why Highland is a \u0026ldquospecial case due to its vast geography.The council has been proactive in reviewing its entire work practices through a cross-party \u0026ldquoredesign board with a mission to be more business-like.
