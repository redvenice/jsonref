The country has been under pressure to come up with a more radical plan for reducing nitrogen emissions in the sector, sparking protests from farmers. Dutch farmers in the south of the country, which has a high density of livestock, are now reportedly being offered as much as €150 (£130) per pig to reduce their herd size. More than 14,000 sheep are believed to have died when cargo ship, The Queen Hind, capsized in the Black Sea on a journey from Romania to Saudi Arabia. While crew members were rescued, just 254 sheep were saved. The recovering sheep are currently being kept in quarantine and animal rights activists are concerned that they could soon be re-exported. European live animal export trade rose in value from $1bn (£800m) in 2000 to $3.3bn in 2018. It is not yet known what caused the ship to capsize, but an animal rights group has claimed it was overloaded. The UK is considering a ban on the export of live farm animals for slaughter if it leaves the EU.The grass is always green and the sun constantly shining for a herd of cows in Russia, thanks to the VR headsets strapped to their heads. The sets are part of a trial running at the RusMoloko farm, near Moscow, to see if gazing at virtual green fields makes cows produce more milk. An increasing number of cows around the world are housed indoors for most or even all of the year. In an effort to counter this loss of outdoor access, a variety of objects and activities are being provided to animals, including rotating brushes, toys and classical music. Researchers claim such enrichment can address the physical and behavioural needs that are not being met in restrictive indoor farms.A harmful algae bloom known as the “red tide” has returned to the Florida coastline, with fears of a surge in wildlife deaths. A 14-month-long algae bloom in Florida ended earlier this year, after killing more than 200 manatees, 127 dolphins and 589 sea turtles. Hundreds of tons of dead fish also washed ashore. The causes of blooms vary, but they are being increasingly linked to the climate crisis and industrialised agriculture.Upland farmers could boost their profitability by reducing livestock numbers to a level that could be supported by natural grass growth and without the use of costly fertiliser and bought-in feed, says a new report. Many upland livestock farms are profitable only because of government subsidies, which are due to be phased out from 2021. If a viable future cannot be found for upland farmers, says the report , then the land may have to be given over for other uses such as building, afforestation or rewilding.Twenty large crates of chicken carcasses have been dumped at multiple locations near Darlington over a 10-day period, according to reports. The incidents are being investigated by Trading Standards officials.The pig industry is celebrating after the Conservative manifesto failed to include a pledge to ban farrowing crates. Boris Johnson had said in October in parliament that Brexit would allow the UK government to ban sow farrowing crates. Labour has previously pledged to introduce a phased ban on the crates but, along with the Liberal Democrats, did not mention a ban in its manifesto. Sweden is the only EU member state so far to have banned farrowing crates. The UK was one of the first countries in Europe to ban gestation crates in 1999.A large mottled pig has been hogging the limelight on Greek national television after chasing a broadcast journalist trying to report on recent mudslides and flooding in the country.They survived all this, they deserve a nice old age.Kuki Barbuceanu, president of the Animal Rescue and Care charity, speaking after reports that the sheep rescued from the capsized vessel The Queen Hind could be re-exported to Saudi Arabia.We want to hear from you about your experiences and stories from inside the farming industry.

Fifty years later, she still likes to shockIn 1980, women artists represented Austria at the Venice Biennale for the first time. One was the 60-year-old painter Maria Lassnig the other was 39-year-old firebrand Valie Export, notorious for plastering Vienna with provocative posters in which her exposed crotch played a central role.Export was a controversial choice for Austria, to say the least. As the organisers stated in the catalogue, back home she was “exposed to continuous obstruction and defamation”. Fearing uproar at the opening, they scheduled two press conferences on consecutive days in the hope of mitigating full-scale outrage. The first was a small gathering of sympathetic press. The second was everyone else and, as expected, they kicked up a storm. Export became a lightning rod of outrage, accused of everything from killing animals to being – God forbid – a feminist.Dressed all in white, her hair the copper of exposed wiring,Valie Export (or VALIE EXPORT as it’s often styled) is now, at 79, a revered figure. Why did her work stir up such fury back then?“The Austrian scene was very traditional, and they didn’t know about conceptual art,” she says. “The second thing was that I am a woman.”The Viennese underground scene of the 60s and 70s was dominated by the actionists: transgressive and, at times, violent performance artists. They may have been artistically avant garde, but their attitudes toward women and the female body remained old-fashioned.Export took the energy, aggression and provocation harnesses by the actionists and turned them to very different ends, raising questions about how women were portrayed in film, how their bodies were sexualised, and the everyday oppression they faced at the hands of the state, society and the Catholic church. As a result, even within the avant garde, Export was regarded with suspicion. The attitude was: “She’s a woman, and she’s against us, fighting for feminism.”At the Thaddaeus Ropac gallery in London, Export’s 1980 Biennale exhibition has just been restaged in its entirety. The centrepiece is Geburtenbett (Birth bed, 1980) a raised resin platform set with mattress springs from which an outsized female abdomen erupts, legs crooked, with red neon strip lights springing from her vagina like fresh blood. Perched where her head might be, a black and white TV transmits a Catholic mass.Lining the walls are photographs, among them religious tableaux restaged with domestic appliances, which were portrayed in advertising of the time as women’s salvation. One is a version of a Michelangelo Pièta in which a young woman appears devoutly perched on a washing machine as it belches out a blood-stained towel.Born Waltraud Lehner in Linz in 1940, she rebranded herself Valie Export – a name inspired by Export brand cigarettes – in 1967. In a self-portrait a year later, she appears hand on jaunty hip, cigarette between pursed lips, holding out a soft pack carrying her face and logo. It’s irresistibly cool, delivered with a knowing smile – two qualities that are Export’s stock in trade. Both were crucial elements in the two works that made her name. TAP and TOUCH Cinema and Action Pants: Genital Panic (both 1968-69) are both forms of what Export terms “expanded cinema”. In the first, the “cinema” is a small box strapped to her naked chest, which in turn becomes the screen. The cinema is so small that only one pair of hands may enter and encounter the screen. In Genital Panic, the action enters the space of the audience in a real cinema. Export arrived at a screening in trousers with a triangle cut out of the crotch and started perambulating the rows with her exposed pubis at face level, causing a “genital panic” within the audience, who scuttled for the exit as she approached.Even as a child, Export had no regard for prim niceties. Her father died during the war, and she was sent with her two sisters to board at a convent while their mother worked as a primary school teacher. The nuns’ private world fascinated Export, and her first expulsion came when, aged 10, she snuck into their living quarters. “I had to tell my mother that they’d thrown me out. She slapped my face then took me back to the school. They were nuns, my mother was a war widow bringing up her children alone, so of course they were obliged to take me back.” The pattern repeated itself many times.Despite this, Export is philosophical about convent life. “I learned a lot. I learned that I needed my own territory, my own space, and I had to defend it if I wanted to become strong,” she recalls. “Otherwise, it was like any convent – strict discipline.” She left at 14 to study at the School of Arts and Crafts in Linz, and, at the age of 18, she got married. Within a year she had a daughter, but the vision of adult independence offered by matrimony turned out to be another trap. “I thought: this is not my life, being married and a mother.”So she orced, placed her daughter temporarily in her sister’s care and moved to Vienna to study. There she encountered a society that remained intensely conservative. “The students around me knew I was orced. Mostly the male students looked at me and said, ‘She’s a orcee, a young woman, so she must be ...’” Export throws a lascivious look. “It was really awkward.” Women, too, were suspicious of her. Her evident sexual experience – and by extension, availability – marked her out as a threat.The legend surrounding Exports Genital Panic had it that the performance took place in a porn cinema, with an audience of men in fact, it was at an arthouse screening. Export’s intended audience was male and female: her target, conservative Viennese society as a whole.“Marriage, the Christian church, religious themes and the traditional side of Vienna at the time – this fossilised Nazi realm, really – all this influenced the work I wanted to do,” she says. “I didn’t want to draw, I didn’t want to paint.” Instead, she wanted to determine a space for herself, just as she had at the convent. At first, she worked with film and photography, always with her own body at the centre. Both Genital Panic and TAP and TOUCH cinema were initially shown within the context of experimental cinema. Export was co-founder of the Austria Filmmakers Cooperative, but the response from fellow film-makers was hardly approving.“I first showed TAP and TOUCH Cinema on stage at a small film festival in Vienna,” she recalls. “Other film-makers rushed on to the stage and yelled at the audience, ‘Is this supposed to be film? Do we have to put up with this?’” Fear that the box strapped to her front would be destroyed by the angry mob forced Export off stage.Subsequent performances out on the street were less alarming. “There wasn’t aggression because it was so unbelievable. A woman stands there, and you can put your hands in and touch,” she says. The ‘film’ was 33 seconds long, and as payment you had to hold Export’s gaze, her knowing smile firmly in place. Women and children participated (“It was a U-certificate film” she laughs) but most of the participants were male. “They didn’t really touch the screen: they were a little afraid. But I wasn’t afraid, because I knew that no one was going to hurt me.”Export also brought Genital Panic into the public realm through a series of large screen-printed posters in which she appears barefoot in her crotchless trousers, legs spread, hair teased, brandishing a gun. Now retitled Action Pants: Genital Panic the image was flyposted across Vienna.The furore surrounding her participation in the Venice Biennale changed little. Despite international recognition, Export did not receive a survey show in Austria until the 90s.Canonisation of a very particular kind arrived in 2005, when Marina Abramović re-enacted seven key performance works of the 20th century at the Guggenheim museum in New York under the title Seven Easy Pieces. Alongside works by herself, Bruce Nauman and Joseph Beuys, Abramović performed Export’s Action Pants: Genital Panic. For the record, it was still shocking, 35 years later.• Valie Export: The 1980 Venice Biennale Works, is at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, London, until 25 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f999efc883420ea98b5b0a50d23f29ce686b704/0_0_2362_3151/master/2362.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89a614e5ff6d6370182a7b72623cf951 1010w","title":"milan kundera czech citizenship restored unbearable lightness of being","story":"The Unbearable Lightness of Being’s author has lived in France since fleeing communism in 1975, and has previously questioned ‘the notion of home’After more than 40 years in exile, Milan Kundera, the Czech-born author of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, has been given back the citizenship of his homeland.Petr Drulák, the Czech Republic’s ambassador to France, told public television he visited the 90-year-old author in his Paris apartment last Thursday to hand deliver his citizenship certificate.“This is a very important symbolic gesture, a symbolic return of the greatest Czech writer in the Czech Republic,” Drulák said, describing the presentation as “a very simple moment, but of great conviviality and human warmth”.“He was in a good mood, just took the document and said thank you,” he added.Kundera, author of internationally acclaimed fiction, was expelled for “anti-communist activities” from the Czechoslovakian party in 1950. He became a hate figure for the authorities and eventually fled to France in 1975. In 1979, his Czech citizenship was revoked and two years later he became a French citizen.His most famous works, including The Unbearable Lightness of Being and The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, were written in France and banned in his homeland until the late 80s. His 1988 novel Immortality was his last novel written in Czech he has since written four more novels in French, the most recent 2014’s The Festival of Insignificance.The idea of restoring Kundera’s citizenship has been floated for years by authorities in the Czech Republic. In November 2018, prime minister Andrej Babiš announced that he had offered to restore the author and his wife Vera’s citizenship after a three-hour meeting with them in their favourite Paris restaurant.“It was a great honour for me,” Babiš wrote at the time, describing Kundera, who is often cited as a contender for the Nobel prize in literature, as a legend of Czech, French and world literature. He said he had invited the Kunderas to visit the Czech Republic, but said the novelist’s response was non-committal.Kundera now lives out of the spotlight and never speaks to reporters. After visiting his homeland in 1996 for the first time since he fled, Kundera has reportedly returned a number of times, but travels incognito.In a 1984 interview with the New York Times, Kundera said that the idea of home was “something very ambiguous” for him.“I wonder if our notion of home isn’t, in the end, an illusion, a myth. I wonder if we are not victims of that myth. I wonder if our ideas of having roots – d’être enraciné – is simply a fiction we cling to,” he said, adding that he had made the choice between living “like an émigré in France or like an ordinary person who happens to write books”.“Do I consider my life in France as a replacement, a substitute life, and not a real life? Do I say to myself: ‘Your real life is in Czechoslovakia, among your old countrymen’? … Or do I accept my life in France – here where I really am – as my real life and try to live it fully? I chose France,” he said.In 2008, Kundera was awarded the Czech national prize for literature but did not return to receive it. In 2009, he was awarded honorary citizenship of Brno, the city where he was born in 1929, but the author remained in France.That same year, he refused to attend a conference in Brno dedicated to his work, sending a letter to the organisers that jokingly described the occasion as a “necrophile party”.In the letter, which was read at the event’s opening, Kundera described himself as a French writer, and insisted that his books should be considered French literature and categorised as such in bookshops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5100033153a6d287cda7f59f3f457fdfddbcf68c/183_510_5817_3490/master/5817.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd87fdf7e3e5e13a88cfe1654276246d","title":"john lewis sales week black friday discounts","story":"Discounts lure shoppers to stores as online retailer Boohoo also has record weekendThe online fashion retailer Boohoo also said it had enjoyed a record Black Friday weekend and that its new brands Karen Millen, Coast and MissPap had been successfully integrated into the business.While online retail enjoyed much of the benefit, physical stores also enjoyed a lift.But industry watchers warned that the Black Friday growth would not necessarily reflect a bumper Christmas.Sales were helped by the timing of the event this year on 29th of the month which coincides with the monthly payday for millions of workers.

Sky said the studio complex, which it hopes will also become a base for other companies’ projects, will result in £3bn being spent on TV and film productions in its first five years.“This was an opportunity to build something brand new, state of the art and at scale,” said the Sky Studios chief executive, Gary Davey. “It is a big enough site to attract very high-end production in both TV and film from all over the world. We are going to fill this thing with projects of all kinds. It means a huge number of new jobs and new investment.”The company has made the move to develop its own production base as the UK increasingly faces a squeeze on studio space as TV companies, film studios and the streaming giants pour billions into making content.More than 200 films and 120 high-end TV shows were made in the UK last year, with a total production spend of more than £3bn.Sky spends about £7bn annually on programming, from Premier League rights to buying shows such as Game of Thrones and original productions such as Chernobyl and Fortitude. Sky has said it intends to double the amount it spends on making its own shows to about £1bn a year over the next five years.Sky Studios Elstree will have 14 stages, the smallest of which will be 1,800 sq metres, with enough space to shoot several films and TV shows at the same time. It will be about a third bigger than the plans to build a Hollywood-style studio complex in Dagenham East, which have been delayed after the developer put its plans on hold.Earlier this year, Netflix struck a deal to set up a permanent production base at Shepperton, home to films including Alien and Mary Poppins Returns. Netflix is spending about $500m (£385m) on making shows and films in the UK this year. Disney, which recently launched its Disney+ streaming service in a number of international markets, has secured space at Pinewood Studios, home to Star Wars and James Bond.A report last year from Lambert Smith Hampton, a property firm that specialises in film and TV space, estimates that new production space equivalent to four new Pinewood Studios will be needed in the UK to meet the demand from the film and high-end TV industry over the next 15 years.“The new studio is a reflection of both the problem and the opportunity in the UK at the moment,” said Jim Reeve, the chief executive of media investment firm Great Point Media. “We are creatively packed. We don’t have remotely enough quality studio space here to service what the film studios, TV companies and other platforms like the streamers want to make here.”The race to create space is leading to a string of new developments. Earlier this year, Pinewood gained planning permission for a £500m expansion of Shepperton, which will make it the second-largest studio in the world. Pinewood is also undergoing a £200m expansion to double its size to keep up with demand.Earlier this year, Steven Knight, the writer and creator of the Birmingham-set drama Peaky Blinders, unveiled an ambitious £100m plan for a 16-hectare (40-acre) film and TV studio in the West Midlands. Developers are seeking planning permission for a £135m film and TV studio complex in Ashford, Kent, on a former locomotive manufacturing site."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b179ee60fcbdbd013c3b7fd85c7e0bdf2633696/0_9_4591_2755/master/4591.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bafe8ebaa25f29d8a87e628a8387187","title":"dominic raab harry dunn anne sacoolas foreign office","story":"The lack of official support since the fatal collision with Anne Sacoolas has forced my family to sue the Foreign OfficeMy wife and I first met Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, on 9 October. Our 19-year-old son, Harry, had been killed two months earlier, when his motorbike was involved in a crash with a car. The driver of the car was Anne Sacoolas. She claimed diplomatic immunity – her husband is a US intelligence official – and fled the country. We were trying to push for her return to the UK – by the time we met Mr Raab, at the Foreign Office, we were desperate for news of any progress.We had been led to believe that the meeting would be helpful, and that Mr Raab would have good news for us. We were not told what the good news might be but we imagined he was going to tell us that she was going to come back for questioning, or that there was at least a plan to make that happen.But the meeting was terrible. Mr Raab was cold, stiff and impersonal. He offered his condolences, yet they only came across as empty words. The worst of it was that he didn’t actually have any good news: he insisted that Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity. Charlotte, my wife, asked him if he would put in another request for a waiver and he said he would do that. I had allowed my hopes to build up, and now I realised we had been brought in on false pretences. It felt to us like a publicity stunt so that Mr Raab could make it look to the public as though he was doing something for us. After we left the meeting, I broke down outside his office. I have been furious with him ever since.A couple of weeks later, in the House of Commons, Mr Raab made a statement that completely contradicted what he told us at the meeting on 9 October. He said that on 8 October, the day before we met him, the US and UK had agreed that the question of diplomatic immunity was no longer pertinent because Anne Sacoolas had left the country. As a result, there were no longer any obstacles to justice. Why, then, had he told us that she still had immunity? When we heard that statement, we were horrified. After that, there was no way we could trust him.Again and again, Mr Rabb and his cabinet colleagues have told the country that he is doing everything he can to assist us. In an interview with Sky News last month, he said he was trying to clear the path to justice – even though he claimed, a month earlier, that there were no obstacles. That was when we realised that this man says things that he thinks will please the public, but has nothing to back them up.We have not heard from Mr Raab at all since our meeting with him. We have made several public appeals for him or anyone in authority to come and talk to us. He has never given me any contact details for getting in touch with him directly.That is why we decided to travel down to a hustings in Mr Raab’s constituency, Esher and Walton, last week. I am desperate for justice for my son. If Mr Raab wasn’t going to let us know what he was doing, I wanted to ask him face to face, so he could explain all the lengths he had supposedly gone to. We also wanted to meet local voters and let them know precisely what was going on. We think politicians should be honest and decent, and we feel Mr Raab is neither of those.He seemed really troubled to see me at the hustings. He was rude and dismissive, he pointed his finger at me. He could have easily pulled me aside and talked to me. If he didn’t have time to speak, he could have arranged for us to meet another time. Instead, he wouldn’t even shake my hand. We are now suing the FCO over its absurd decision to advise Northants police that Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity. We have brought this case not only for Harry, but for everyone in the country. The US and UK governments are ripping up the rule of law and that affects each and every one of us. Today, during Donald Trump’s visit to the UK, we are protesting outside Buckingham Palace in an attempt to make ourselves heard.All we want is for Anne Sacoolas to return, so she can face the consequences of her actions that night when she took my Harry’s life, and for the truth in this whole mess to come out. I am not aware of a single cabinet minister who has called publicly for her to be returned. That is shameful. It’s hard to escape the conclusion that the British authorities care more about preserving the relationship with the US than looking after the rights of citizens like us.• Tim Dunn is the father of Harry Dunn, a 19-year-old motorcyclist killed outside a Northamptonshire RAF base"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e72221838af0984212378a4b649ab1ed0a95970/0_115_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abeca267c35f3c7845e5c810b30ef352","title":"rebecca solnit why im supporting the guardian this giving tuesday","story":"How the news is reported shapes the news, and the ’s fierce candor on corruption, destruction and brutality mattersI’ve probably reached the maximum number of times you can watch the archetypal American Christmas movie, It’s a Wonderful Life, but one thing about it will always stick with me: the idea that you can measure the impact of someone or something by imagining their absence.In the film, we get to see how bleak the town and many inidual lives in it would be had the protagonist never been born.

It was summer, always a slow time for TV, so I thought: “Why not?” The remit was that we would talk about anything and everything from a female point of view, but it didn’t have to be limited to women’s issues.I knew early that we were on to something good. Loose Women is unlike anything else on TV. The View, an American talk show, predates it, but that’s quite political. The British take was to add humour. Over the years, various producers have come in with different ideas. Some have worked, some haven’t, and we’ve changed the set and the colourings a million times, but the absolute essence hasn’t changed. There is no point in trying to add bells and whistles. We agreed it should follow the normal pattern of female conversation. When we ladies are out for lunch, we go from uproarious laughter to something topical to something bit teary. So we mimic that in the show. We switch from serious topics to emotional ones, to some sort of public debate, like: “Do you iron your knickers?”We did a month initially, and the viewing figures were good and we all thought it had potential, so when it was commissioned for a further 12-week run we hoped we were onto something. But it was only ever recommissioned in short bursts. We’d have a fantastic wrap party: “Isn’t it amazing?” “Aren’t we brilliant?” “Ha ha ha,” “We love each other,” “See ya.” Then we’d have to wait weeks and weeks for a call. Nadia and I co-presented from 1999 until 2002 when she left to have her first daughter. At one point we lived together too, like Eric and Ernie. Nadia would roll in at three o’clock in the morning, blind drunk, and I’d have fallen asleep after Question Time.We are called Loose Women because the format is loose. It’s how women talk. One minute we’re roaring with laughter, the next we’re crying with misery. I’d come from this hippy, gin-swilling, actressy background, and back in summer 1999 I’d just come out of EastEnders, playing a gangster character called Annie Palmer, when I was asked to film the pilot. I was in makeup, flicking through OK! magazine, chatting about Victoria Beckham, not realising I was talking to the show’s editor. She later told me she’d decided I’d got the part there and then.Jane Moore had a similar “interview”. At the pilot, they asked her to look into the camera and say: “Hello, I’m a Loose Woman.” She said no. That’s when the editor decided to offer Jane the job as a presenter.I’ll never forget meeting Kaye. She had a great big newspaper, I believe it was the , and she kept shaking it, as if to show me she reads the big newspapers. All the women seemed highbrow and posh and I didn’t understand why they needed me. Then I realised: opposites was actually what they needed. It was all about getting different types of women: four sassy, smart, witty, women who can talk the hind legs off a donkey.We only have celebrity guests on if they bring something to the show. Whoopi Goldberg was charming and loved me because I’d been on EastEnders – I couldn’t believe she watched it! In the early days a man wouldn’t come anywhere near the set, but now we have two Loose Men on the panel and we’ve had Gok Wan and Freddie Flintoff on talking about their mental health, which would only happen on a women’s show.I used to say to Kaye: “It won’t have legs for long, this. What are we going to talk about?” And she said: “Don’t be ridiculous. Think of a friendship that lasts for decades. The conversation goes on and on.” We’ve now been doing it for 20 years, and the 3,000th episode aired in May. We had a scream when we lived together. We were never stuck for something to say, even though I was the party girl and she wore the tweedy knickers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6df40f9cc1d5e2016f94816276dc0f2300fc839d/25_672_3709_2225/master/3709.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69537526a2805ff3f6afeaad1a0fc5a9","title":"british schoolchildren among least satisfied with their lives says oecd report","story":"Influential survey reveals UK 15-year-olds reported biggest declines in life satisfactionSchoolchildren in Britain are more likely to be miserable and less likely to think that their lives have meaning compared with children in other countries, according to an influential OECD survey that shows a slight improvement in the UK’s international education performance.The OECD’s programme for international student assessment (Pisa), which quizzes 15-year-olds on reading, maths, science and a range of attitudes, found that those in the UK had the biggest declines in life satisfaction since its last survey in 2015, with barely half reporting that they were satisfied with their lives.The triennial Pisa findings come amid a largely positive set of test results for the UK, with improvements in Wales and England boosting their international rankings alongside more mixed results for Scotland and Northern Ireland.Dr Angela Donkin, the chief social scientist for the National Foundation for Educational Research, which conducted the Pisa study in the UK, said: “The fact that we have seen the largest fall in life attitudes for all countries should be a wakeup call.“This isn’t just down to the education sector alone to solve, but for the sector to be able to help we need to ensure that mental health provision is properly funded.”The OECD tested children in 79 countries, and found that British 15-year-olds ranked 69th out of 72 countries in the world for life satisfaction, with boys in particular among the least satisfied with their lives.One cause may be that British children ranked next to last among those agreeing that “my life has a clear meaning or purpose”, while the UK was alone in Europe in having more than half of its children reporting that they regularly felt sad. More than one in four British pupils reported being bullied “at least a few times a month”, higher than the OECD average.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the UK’s performance was “tarnished by the worryingly high percentages of miserable and worried pupils” that Pisa has revealed.“These Pisa results will almost certainly be weaponised by the various political parties in order to defend or attack each other’s policies. We’d urge all parties to refrain from this and instead consider the children at the heart of these statistics and the dedicated professionals behind them,” Whiteman said.Overall, the academic results were dominated by the east Asian powerhouses, with mainland China’s entry – comprising pupils from the regions of Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang – outperforming by a large margin the other 78 countries in maths and science.China’s rise relegated Singapore, which topped the rankings in 2015, to second place in all three subjects, although in reading alone Singapore’s scores were indistinguishable from those of China. Macao followed close behind, while Estonia was Europe’s standout performer, supplanting Finland as the highest-performing OECD member.In Pisa’s core tests, Wales was the only UK nation to improve in each of its scores in reading, maths and science compared with the previous tests in 2015, while England had better results in reading and maths countered by a fall in science. Scotland’s decline in science continued, although both it and Northern Ireland had improved scores in reading.Kirsty Williams, Wales’s minister for education, said the results showing students in Wales achieving close to the OECD averages in all three subjects were “positive but not perfect”.“For the first time ever, Wales is in the international mainstream, thanks to the efforts of our teachers and students. We have caught up, we are continuing to improve in all areas and as a nation we must be determined to keep up this momentum,” Williams said.But experts warned that the results for inidual UK countries showed few differences from previous years, despite England’s improvement in mathsthat helped its ranking improve from 20th to 13th, putting it alongside Germany, Finland and Ireland.John Jerrim, a UCL professor of education who studies the Pisa process, said: “The big story in England will be that scores have gone up about 10 points higher in maths and that is not seen across the rest of the UK. I would say it’s far too early to call it a trend, and we can’t read too much into it yet.”The 2018 Pisa tests concentrated on reading, with the NFER’s analysis noting that there were no significant differences between reading scores in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Wales’s reading score was “significantly lower” than the rest of the UK but not significantly different from the OECD average.Pisa’s survey of staff found headteachers in Scotland reporting more problems with pupil absence and teacher absenteeism than those in the rest of the UK. School leaders in Wales reported greater shortages of educational materials, and those in Northern Ireland were more likely to complain about inadequate buildings and infrastructure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec0241f362a42c7abcfcf09ccbea186fa0829f4b/0_75_3429_2057/master/3429.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=946572b7422ba6eaa82cc59c9fa284d3","title":"decade of exceptional heat likely to be hottest on record experts say","story":"World Meteorological Organization says 2019 is likely to be second or third warmest year everThe last decade has been one of “exceptional” heat around the world, and was almost certainly the hottest on record, while the oceans have also warmed to record levels and grown markedly more acidic, the World Meteorological Organization has said.Temperatures for the years from 2010 to 2019 were about 1.1C above the average for the pre-industrial period, showing how close the world is coming to the 1.5C of warming that scientists say will cause dramatic impacts, extreme weather and the loss of vital ecosystems.The preliminary findings of the State of the Global Climate, an annual publication by the WMO, show that this year is on course to be the second or third warmest since records began.Over land, the impacts from January to October have included severe droughts, heatwaves and floods across all inhabited continents, and over the seas there have also been heatwaves.During the past year, the upper levels of the oceans, measured since the 1950s, have exceeded previous records so far this year, and the ocean experienced about 1.5 months of unusually warm temperatures, with large areas of the north-east Pacific showing severe heatwaves. The Arctic sea ice minimum in September was the third smallest on record. The final version of the report will be published in March.Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API\u0026nbspwarned\u0026nbspthe industry: “Time is running out.”Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.The Nasa scientist\u0026nbspJames Hansen testifies to the US Senate\u0026nbspthat “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A\u0026nbspconfidential report\u0026nbspprepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies\u0026nbspestablish\u0026nbspthe Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking.

Countries from the Bahamas to Japan to Mozambique suffered devastating tropical cyclones. Wildfires swept through the Arctic and Australia,” he said.He warned that more erratic rainfall patterns posed a threat to crop yields, which, combined with population increases, would mean “considerable food security challenges for vulnerable countries in the future”.The findings came as the world’s governments gathered in Madrid for a critical UN conference on the climate. On Monday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned that though the technology and economic means to fight climate chaos were available, political will was lacking.He called on world leaders and governments to pay heed to young people, who were “showing remarkable leadership and mobilisation”.The latest WMO figures showed the pattern of warming was growing stronger, warned Keith Shine, regius professor of meteorology and climate science at the University of Reading.“Each of the past four decades has been 0.1 to 0.2C warmer than the decade before. Carbon dioxide levels have continued their relentless rise, and methane levels have grown much more rapidly than in the previous decade. Unless things start to change markedly, it is going to get harder and harder to meet the goals of the Paris agreement.”While average temperatures may seem to be only gradually creeping up over decades, this disguises the true impact on lives, explained Grant Allen, professor of atmospheric physics at the University of Manchester.“These impacts are real and happening now and place huge pressures on communities and countries – put simply, these impacts make for a more unstable world, and are already having profound impacts on our ecosystems and bioersity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54009b83a381d3dcbcc6270b3d243dd9c4423973/0_92_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39dbd006a861b4a9d97b2434b8938ab9","title":"greta thunberg arrives in lisbon cop25 after three week voyage from us","story":"Climate activist heading to COP25 in Madrid after crossing Atlantic on family’s yacht The climate activist Greta Thunberg has arrived in Lisbon after a three-week catamaran voyage across the Atlantic Ocean from the US.The Swedish teenager now plans to head to Spain to attend the UN climate conference in Madrid.Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”.

Her representatives said they could not confirm when she would travel to the Spanish capital.China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US.

Their wild relatives – many of which are at risk of extinction – are sturdier because they have evolved to survive more challenging conditions.“These wild plants are related to a wide range of important crops,” said Hannes Dempewolf, a senior scientist at the Crop Trust, which ran the project in partnership with the Kew Royal Botanic Gardens’ Millennium Seed Bank project.“They hold the genetic ersity which breeders will need to improve those crops so we can feed 9 billion people with nutritious food.”For centuries scientists have travelled the world collecting plants – initially to grow in gardens – but increasingly they are looking to save seeds and store them in sub-zero vaults to ensure long-term survival.Collectors working on the Crop Wild Relatives (CWR) project spent a total of 2,973 days in the field and saved 4,644 seed samples from 371 crop wild relatives, according to a report published by the Crop Trust. They found seeds from 28 globally important crops, including nine species of banana, 21 of wild barley, two species of wild potato and four of wild aubergine.Researchers examined gene banks across the world and identified which had dangerously low ersity before setting out on expeditions to far-flung parts of Asia, Africa, Europe and South America. They used GPS to tag the location of their discoveries and silica gel to preserve the seeds.In one of the most treacherous expeditions, collectors in Nepal travelled on elephants to ward off tigers and rhinos. They found a species of wild rice (Oryza meyeriana) that is resistant to bacterial blight and collected a relative of the sweet potato (Ipomoea cairica) with high resistance to insect attack that can grow in salty soils.In Ecuador, collectors wore long plastic boots with metal tips to protect them from snakebites while collecting an elusive variety of high-yielding rice (Oryza grandiglumi) that is endemic to tropical America and tolerates flooding.Security concerns caused by al-Shabaab prevented collectors reaching their targets in the Lamu district of Kenya. Missions to north-eastern Nigeria were abandoned in 2015 and 2016 due to the Boko Haram insurgency but collectors were able to access the region in 2017.Dempewolf said: “The expeditions were not a walk in the park. They were perilous at times and physically demanding, with heat, dust, sweat and danger from wild animals – from blood-sucking leeches to tigers. The stories these seed collectors brought back from the field often resemble scenes from an Indiana Jones movie.”Seeds are only ripe for a narrow window of time and if collectors were too early they had to visit the site again. If they were too late they had to wait until the following year.Nicola Ardenghi from the University of Pavia in Italy spotted a type of pea with edible tubers while looking out of a train window between Piacenza and Milan – his team had almost given up hope before it was found.Many of these crops are already threatened with extinction due to deforestation, urban sprawl, conflict and the climate crisis. In some cases, wild crop relatives were already lost. For example in Costa Rica, land which was once home to wild rice has been turned into sugarcane plantations and tilapia ponds.Scientists say this work is more important than ever. “If we are to feed a growing population, we need to make our food crops more resilient. And crop wild relatives can help breeders develop new ‘climate-proof’ varieties,” said Marie Haga, the outgoing executive director of the Crop Trust.The wild relatives of crops share a “gene pool” which means that although they may be different species they are close enough relatives to exchange genetic traits. The collected samples are available to breeders and farmers everywhere and can be crossed with domesticated varieties.Work is already under way to develop 19 new crops with international partners in 38 countries. More than a dozen farmer seed clubs in the Mekong delta of Vietnam are testing rice derived from crosses with wild cousins.“This project has only succeeded thanks to the dedication and hard work of iniduals in organisations around the world working towards a common goal, to safeguard crop wild relatives, that previously were overlooked and disregarded, but probably hold the key to the world’s food security in the years ahead,” said Chris Cockel, Crop Wild Relatives project coordinator at Kew."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bbefdb5137e51af1e1809fff8f60c328dc5b3de/89_0_1237_742/master/1237.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9c393200b3f23c60687ec11c39511ba","title":"davina mccall i wore this with vast amounts of tit tape and a riding crop","story":"The TV presenter on her favourite outfit, dressing for Big Brother and why wrinkly skin is nothing to be ashamed ofThis dress was extremely different to anything I’d ever worn – and more risque. It was black with long sleeves and it came down below the knee, but it had a plunging neckline and needed vast amounts of tit tape. I wore it in 2000 to present the Q awards, which were always really raucous. I’d slightly tamed my dressing to be on telly, but when I was younger I was quite wild in my choice of clothes, so I just thought: ‘Why don’t I try something outrageous for fun?’ I wore this with a patent collar and took a riding crop with me on the red carpet – I really pushed the boat out!This was the same year I started presenting Big Brother. On the first series I just wore trainers, flared trousers and pretty tops terrible clothes really, but I wore them so I could run back and forth from the house to the studio – the show was live and there wasn’t much time. For the second series, I wore flat shoes again because I was pregnant and then, from the third series on, I mostly only ever wore black. My sense of style also changed and I realised I could bring a lot more of “me” to the clothes that I wore to present.Reality TV has changed a lot in terms of fashion – clothes from the early 00s were horrific. Perhaps we’ll look back on the 2010s and think the same thing. But people on Big Brother weren’t on the pull – they were just trying to survive 13 weeks in the house contestants on Love Island are, and when you’re on the pull you always want to look your very best. As I’ve got older, I’ve tried to be slightly more chic. I was talking to someone recently about crinkly knee skin and why that shouldn’t be embarrassing. It’s interesting that society makes us feel that tight, pert skin is the only skin that’s of value but actually my wrinkly knees have lived through a lot of stuff which makes me of great value.

Recipes continually tell me to add one or two sticks of celery to a soup or stew. But what am I meant to do with the rest of the bunch?Max, Bicester, OxonFeast’s own Little Miss Perfect, Felicity Cloake, isn’t what you’d call a celery enthusiast. “It’s vile raw,” she spits. “Stringy, and as bitter and minerally as a dishwasher tablet. Ugh!” Cooked, she can live with the stuff, she admits, “but the only way I’d countenance raw celery is as my mum used to serve it, with a ribbon of Primula down the centre”. But Max asks a sensible question – what do you do with the rest of the head once you’ve used up a stick or two in a soffritto, stew or cream cheese-smeared treat? – so we’ll give refuseniks a wide berth from hereon in.Chef Anna Tobias, by contrast, is a celery cheerleader. “It’s so aromatic,” she swoons, “with delicate, earthy notes similar to parsley, only more subtle. It’s in the foundations of so many dishes that, if it wasn’t there, you’d miss it.” But, she adds, there’s a big difference between those pale, thin-stalked, plastic-wrapped supermarket bundles and the butch, green behemoths with a forest of leaves that you get at decent markets.The obvious solution to Max’s issue, especially in winter, is soup, says Tobias, who cut her teeth at Blueprint Cafe in its 2000s heyday, before moving on first to the River Cafe and then the head chef gig at Rochelle Canteen she’s currently looking to open her own place in London next year. “It’s a cinch, and has very few ingredients. Saute chopped celery and onion in butter, add a bit of cream, blitz, season and it’s job done.”You could also turn your excess into an equally warming braise or gratin, but Tobias turns up the celery gauge even higher and uses it as the main ingredienta rather out-there stuffing, an idea nicked off her mum, a fellow fan girl: “Sweat lots of chopped celery with a couple of onions in a fair bit of butter, then add loads of lemon zest and some juice, and stir in the chopped celery leaves.” It goes remarkably well with chicken and turkey, she says, so that’s maybe one to bookmark for the Christmas bird.“The Chinese use celery a lot, too,” says Tobias, now warming to her task, “especially in stir-fries, it can really take a sharp, high heat. Try it with lamb and lots of ginger – that’s yummy. Or go Italian, and fry it in oil with chopped garlic and chilli, then stir in some cooked pulses – a tin of chickpeas is great with that.”Tobias is in good company with her celery crush. Joyce Molyneux, in her The Carved Angel Cookery Book, swears by roasting it with pheasant and port, saying this “time-honoured combination outlives the fleeting fashions of the food world”, a sentiment from the 90s we could all do with getting behind now. And Jane Grigson, in her iconic Vegetable Book, goes so far as to give it shared top billing with aubergine in southern Italy’s favourite melanzane antipasto, caponata, and who are we to argue with the the likes of her?That said, her celery sauce to go with boiled turkey in English Food is maybe pushing it a bit far, seeing as that features an entire head, chopped, boiled for 20 minutes, then drained, sauteed in butter and mixed with 500ml bechamel before being pureed. As for Grigson’s jugged celery – the stalks are stuffed in a jar of apple puree with bacon – something tells me that’s probably even more of an acquired taste. *waves at Felicity*• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Or rather, they’re already here, and already launching the next step in a takeover by stealth that may only just be entering its imperial phase.English football has always had its own quiet obsession with American scale, American razzmatazz, and above all American money. In the late 1970s Jimmy Hill and his consortium members managed to lose a million dollars a year on the Washington Diplomats franchise in the North American Soccer League, a venture that saw Hill and co pay $200,000 to watch an injured, essentially immobile Johan Cruyff score a single brilliant goal from inside his own half before the whole thing folded.“I have never forgotten it, or how much it cost,” Hill wrote of that Cruyff goal in his autobiography. “And to this day I look very carefully at any business deal that arrives with an American accent.”On Sunday morning the US’s fifth richest corporation launched its own arrival as a Premier League player with a trip down the Thames on an Amazon Prime barge. Invited parties were offered the chance to hobnob with celebrity guests, perform some kind of “crossing skills” challenge, and generally do lots of things that have little to do with English football and quite a lot to with the more familiar business of high-end salesmanship.There is almost something reassuringly rickety about this unveiling, something reassuringly ITV Digital. English football has always been a stage for speculators. From flighty club chairmen to Rupert Murdoch’s dish-led transformation, the league carries the sweaty fingerprints of a century’s worth of rain-makers and carpetbaggers.At which point, enter Jeff Bezos, who distinguishes himself from this company first by his status as the planet’s wealthiest person, the man who sold the world back to itself in cardboard boxes. And second by the scale of Amazon’s operation, a footprint that allows the Premier League to be offered as a loss leader for the main business of overseeing the digital logistics of a large portion of the human race.Be afraid, traditional broadcasters and, indeed, traditional supporters. This could yet be a profound point of change. Kicking off with Crystal Palace v Bournemouth on Tuesday night Amazon will stream its package of 20 Premier League games across the next three and a half weeks. Coverage is bookended by a simulcast of five games on Wednesday night and then six – yes! Six! – on Boxing Day.Clive Tyldesley will act as the lead commentator. A mob-handed posse of 43 talking punditry heads has been hired, among them Harry Redknapp, Alan Shearer and Gabby Logan. It is a reassuringly glossy, reassuringly familiar-looking package, menaced only by the prospect of substandard UK streaming speeds.But step back a little and this is all part of a wider transatlantic insurgence. Bezos may have the look of a wide-eyed alien frontiersman, but he is following a well-trodden path. The arrival of the Silver Lake investment company at Manchester City last month means seven Premier League clubs now have some form of US ownership. Sky Sports, architect of the boom years, is a US-owned company these days following its sale last year to the broadcast giant Comcast.In the last few months even the newspaper industry has been jolted by the arrival of The Athletic, self-styled Netflix of sports writing, funded by American venture capitalists and openly hostile in its cash-splurging attack on the market share of traditional British media.At the end of which Wednesday night’s Merseyside derby will see British football fans watching the US-owned Premier League leaders on a US-based internet service – with the chance to read about it all on a US-owned subscription website the next day.This is, of course, a sign of continuing commercial good health. The Premier League has succeeded as a global product. Choice, we are told repeatedly, is only good. Welcome to the great global bazaar.And yet like every other aspect of football’s transformation, this comes with a price tag. Amazon’s entrance to the marketplace has been trumpeted as something entirely beneficial. News reports have described the deal as “breaking the stranglehold” of existing broadcasters. Some have written of the freebie offer to existing subscribers and new sign-ups as somehow returning football to free-to-air status (a laughable suggestion: Amazon is nothing if not a mindbogglingly expert cash-raking exercise).Players will earn more, clubs will spend more every part of the football industrial complex will welcome this frothing new income stream. But in reality this money comes, as ever, from those who pay to watch. The entry of BT Sport into this marketplace was similarly trumpeted as a golden moment of choice. In practice it became necessary for football supporters to pay twice, to engage with yet another monthly contract, just to receive essentially the same service.With the entry of a third major provider it remains a late-stage capitalism kind of choice. No matter how glossy and fun the Amazon product, how high the players’ salaries, English football fans are basically still being sold the same things they already owned in the first place.The prospects for genuine change depend on how far Amazon intends to go. This is a company with pockets deep enough to effectively take control, to blow Sky out of the water. Amazon Prime is the most profitable part of the business. With the Premier League thrown in it would perhaps generate significant growth in the same way Premier League football carried Sky’s early satellite service.But there are also hazards. The success of the English league is based on its strength in depth, which is in turn based around collective rights deals, the idea that all clubs in the top tier distribute revenue as evenly as possible. This is a kind of holy founding writ of the Premier League, the principle that allows clubs such as Leicester to challenge however briefly the dominance of the commercial giants.Some clubs, most notably Manchester City, have railed against this distinctly English way of doing things. Amazon’s streaming service would make it easier than ever to disregard, to sell access inidually at the click of a mouse, allowing the bigger clubs to pitch themselves as global revenue monsters to be measured only against Real Madrid, Barcelona, the Dallas Cowboys, the next series of Game of Thrones.For these reasons some will perhaps hope that Amazon is only dipping a toe in these waters. There is an opportunity to change this landscape completely, although into what is another question altogether. Greater revenue, a better service or another small step in English football’s journey into pure commodification."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e7c5376f597cbe24cf824a430346fcdb0560e80/0_203_5370_3221/master/5370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fdf98c58579281f69f1e1b801e8f9bd","title":"the fiver ballon dor messi rapinoe","story":"Sign up now!

In December 1985, there was no football on TV at allBy Steven Pye for That 1980s Sports BlogOverindulgence is often a problem over the festive period and this is not just limited to food and drink. There will be 41 Premier League matches broadcast live on TV in the UK. When you add in games from the FA Cup, League Cup, Football League, Champions League, Europa League, European and global leagues, as well as all the highlights packages, is there a chance that we are reaching saturation point?Football has not always been this way. Can you imagine the uproar if it had been announced in the summer that there would be no football on our TV screens this season? No live games, no Match of the Day, no Goals on Sunday, no Super Sunday, no Monday Night football and no clips on the news. That’s exactly happened in 1985.Football was at rock bottom as the 1984-85 season drew to a close. Hooliganism blighted the sport, with deaths at matches in Birmingham and Brussels – the latter ultimately leading to a European ban. Stadiums up and down the country were decaying, with the Bradford fire demonstrating the lack of regard given to the safety of the supporters who were still brave enough to attend matches.With football in such a mess, the last thing the sport needed was to disappear from television schedules completely. But, when the Football League rejected a joint bid from the BBC and ITV in February 1985, a battle commenced that would pit TV executives against club chairman until the new year. The bone of contention revolved around the number of live matches that both parties wanted to screen. The TV companies offered to pay £19m to show 19 live matches per season for the next four years, but the clubs insisted that no more than 13 games (10 in the league plus the League Cup semi-finals and final) be broadcast.With chairmen such as Ken Bates of Chelsea, Robert Maxwell of Oxford United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham and Sir Arthur South of Norwich City fighting the Football League’s corner, any prospect of a quick resolution seemed unlikely. “Football rates itself far too highly,” said the BBC’s head of sport Jonathan Martin. “It has no God-given right to be on television.”With 36 of the 92 league clubs reportedly in debt, a lack of television money would prove damaging. The bigger clubs were concerned that not being on TV would affect their sponsorship deals and the clubs in the bottom two isions worried that they would miss out on a vital £25,000 payment from any TV package. Liverpool chairman John Smith was keen to strike a deal, saying: “It’s all very well certain publicity-conscious chairmen mesmerising our members with telephone numbers of cash. The clubs with any understanding realise they need television far more than television needs football.”The two sides set a deadline of June to reach an agreement but it was not going to be easy. “We are prepared to renegotiate,” said ITV head of sport John Bromley. “But it’s up to them to approach us and we shall only be able to offer them substantially less than our original offer.” Naturally, this did not go down well.Clubs had to improve their safety standards and fall in line with recommendations made in the Popplewell Inquiry but, without a TV deal in place, some of them were facing a perilous financial state. “It is no overstatement to say clubs are fighting for their existence,” said Football League secretary Graham Kelly in July. But, as the 1985-86 season drew closer, it became apparent that there would be no football on television for the first time in 20 years.Bromley, the head of sport at ITV, did not sound too worried. “Recorded football is a dead duck,” he said. “The days when the Big Match or Match of the Day kept people in on a Sunday afternoon or Saturday night are over. The public don’t want it any more. They want live action.” Any football on our screens would have been nice but, with the Football League concerned that showing more live matches would reduce crowds even further, no compromise was reached. As the league season kicked off on Saturday 17 August, football fans were left in the dark.Finally, after months of wrangling between the TV companies and clubs, fans were given an early Christmas present. Starting in the new year, the TV companies would pay £1.3m to show six live league matches, three League Cup games, plus live FA Cup ties from the third round until the quarter-finals. “We believe that putting the game back on the screens will stimulate interest rather than kill it,” said Everton chairman Philip Carter. “We are anxious the more positive side of football is shown and television is the vehicle to do that.”“Everyone involved should be congratulated on a sensible solution,” said Bromley. “We hope this deal will bring the glamour back to the game and bring the stars back into the living room.” Come the new year, football was back on our screens. Fans breathed a sigh of relief and, on Saturday 4 January 1986, sat down to watch Grimsby v Arsenal and Portsmouth v Aston Villa on the Big Match. Bliss. The following day live football returned and we saw McAvennie set up strike partner Tony Cottee in West Ham’s 1-0 win at Charlton in the FA Cup.All was right with the world again. But among the wreckage of failed meetings, clues about the future direction of the sport were visible. The waters had been muddied in October, when talks of a new Super League circulated. With satellite channel Screensport mentioned, the seeds of the Premier League had well and truly been planted. BBC and ITV paid £6.2m per season for the rights from 1986 to 1988, with the price going up to £44m per season in the 1988-92 deal. And then came Sky.Paying £190m per season for the right to show live football, Sky truly blew their opponents out of the water in 1992, as Tottenham chairman Alan Sugar advised. The rest is history. The latest SkyBT deal in 2018 was £4.5bn. In 1985, money was too tight to mention seven years later a satellite station changed English football forever.• This blog first appeared on That 1980s Sports Blog• Follow Steven Pye on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47c4a57747f2c9dc6130d01e39267b8b2a75b149/0_209_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83ae004da67310c858dd0ee974dd19c0","title":"nintendo ring fit adventure i get a full hard workout but i dont look good doing it","story":"Many Christmases ago, I campaigned successfully for a Super Scope: a shoulder-mounted ersatz missile launcher to plug into my Super Nintendo. It was approximately 15ft long and in retrospect had no good games designed for it. The Scope wound up the way of all console peripherals: propped in the corner of the lounge, useless, like a piece of pipe a plumber had forgotten to clear away. Until we had guests and my parents implored me to keep my bazooka in the bedroom.I still think about it, so was intrigued when I saw a new Nintendo console and peripheral on the market. This one targets the fitness crowd and I can justify playing it as part of what I insist on calling my job.The Switch itself is heavy and handsomely built, with two dinky, removable controllers. I slot one into the handheld wheel and place the other into a holster as directed, strapping it to the front of my thigh. It will measure how high I lift my knees when jogging and how low I drop a squat (all the way to the floor, baby, for a quick nap).I turn it on and I am confronted by an endless boardwalk that needs running down, apparently. Hmm. Yet considering we’re talking about a pilates ring and a remote control stuck to my leg, I’m surprised at how expansive the possibilities are. You control the character onscreen by running in place and squeezing the ring in and out to hoover up coins, bust open crates and leap chasms. You can shoot weaponised air puffs, too. Are these farts? Probably not, although I am exerting myself a lot. There are about 100 levels, over 20 different worlds, and attack moves based on knee lifts, ab crunches and the like. I’m getting a full, hard workout, which I didn’t expect and don’t look good doing. Is there anything less attractive than a grown man playing computer games in the afternoon while heavily sweating?There are addictive little standalone games included: air go-karting, being a human pinball or parachute, or the most bizarre of all, sculpting a clay pot via chair poses. Squatty pottery aside, where I anticipated gimmickry and tedium, the main game provides a legitimate, varied workout and complex gameplay.I was feeling fairly positive about its health potential until I invited my genuinely fit friend Chris to give the game a go. It’s hypnotic to watch, an athletic man tippy-tapping the carpet on besocked toes, trying to trick the computer into thinking he is running quickly. He looked like a cartoon raccoon stealing a custard bun. Thanks to the eagle-eyed thigh sensor, he wasn’t getting away with it, either. It was a vision of the ridiculous, which led me to understand there is little dignity to be had playing this game.Also, after playing Ring Fit for several days, I realised that I had been missing fresh air. I don’t really want a “fun workout”. I don’t want any workout at all. I’m too lazy and proud for Ring Fit. And I don’t think hardcore gymnasium-rabbits will be replacing their daily reps with this childish game, either.But, for the casually fitness-interested, it’s probably the most exciting way to get into resistance training. Whether you’re inclined to log on or jog on, Nintendo deserves respect for that.The Switch’s screen is small, so this workout would be intensified if enlarged on a TV. I recently got rid of mine, in an attempt to restore my pre-digital personality. Turns out I was never that interesting. And I can’t watch Friends any more.One ring to rule the mall. 45 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Summarising the findings, the head of the API\u0026nbspwarned\u0026nbspthe industry: “Time is running out.”Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.The Nasa scientist\u0026nbspJames Hansen testifies to the US Senate\u0026nbspthat “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A\u0026nbspconfidential report\u0026nbspprepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies\u0026nbspestablish\u0026nbspthe Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out\u0026nbspan ad in The New York Times\u0026nbsptitled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose\u0026nbspmain donors\u0026nbspare in the oil and gas industry,\u0026nbspleads\u0026nbspthe “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which\u0026nbspends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals\u0026nbsp90 companies\u0026nbspare responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each\u0026nbspdonate at least $500,000\u0026nbspfor the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the\u0026nbspbiggest threat\u0026nbspto the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.Johnson’s head of communications complained to Ofcom about the decision to exclude Gove and alleged a widespread pattern of anti-Tory bias at the channel, referencing the head of news Dorothy Byrne’s criticisms of the prime minister. Conservative party sources also threatened a review of Channel 4’s public service remit in the next parliament as retaliation.Ofcom ruled that it was perfectly fair to insist only Johnson could represent the Conservatives given “other participants had only agreed to attend on the basis that they would be debating against other leaders”.They also concluded the decision to replace Johnson – and the Brexit party leader Nigel Farage – with an ice sculpture did not breach due impartiality rules. Ofcom concluded this was a “relatively low-key” way of empty-chairing the politicians – hinting it could have taken a different view if, as had been suggested in advance, the ice sculptures had been carved in the shape of the politicians.Under the first-past-the-post voting system, tactical voting is when you vote for a party that you would not normally support in order to stop another party from winning. For example, in a constituency where the result is usually tight between a party you dislike and a party you somewhat dislike, and the party you support usually comes a distant third and has no chance of winning, you might choose to lend your vote to the party you somewhat dislike. This avoids ‘“wasting” your vote on a party that cannot win the seat, and boosting the chances that the party you dislike most will lose.Ofcom “took into account that the globe ice sculpture was not a representation of the prime minister personally, and little editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants”.The regulator made clear there was no obligation for any of the political parties or politicians to participate in any particular programme – and broadcasters could empty-chair politicians as long as they found other ways to ensure standards of due impartiality were met.The regulator concluded that Channel 4 had fulfilled its obligation to represent Conservative viewpoints during the programme itself, and through a subsequent report on the following evening’s Channel 4 News.Labour\u0027s \u0027green new deal\u0027 - or \u0027green industrial revolution\u0027 - proposes a massive programme of state investment to rapidly decarbonise the economy, creating hundreds of thousands of green jobs, and transforming the way people live - from upgrading the housing stock to revitalising public transport,\u0026nbsptackling the UK’s air pollution crisis to moving towards a more sustainable agricultural model.Although the initial investment would be huge, advocates say that would be dwarfed by the cost of not tackling the escalating climate crisis and point to wide-ranging\u0026nbspeconomic benefits in the medium term,\u0026nbsppositioning the UK at the forefront of the emerging green industries, which are expected to dominate in the coming years.Crucially, the green new deal would tie radical environmental action to a worker-led “just transition”, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by – and benefits – ordinary people. Its advocates say jobs in carbon-intensive industries would be replaced by – among others – those in wind, solar, house building and transport infrastructure.Labour\u0027s manifesto put the green new deal at the centre of its\u0026nbsp2019\u0026nbspelection campaign. The idea has also been championed by leading Democratic presidential candidates in the US\u0026nbsp2020 race.\u0026nbspInternationally, its supporters say any such proposal must also recognise the west’s historic responsibility for the crisis - and its global nature - and support a just transition in the developing world through transfers of technology and finance, while welcoming migrants.Ofcom’s rules on due impartiality require coverage of alternative views that is “adequate or appropriate to the subject and nature of the programme”, rather than providing equal airtime to all sides of a debate.Documents provided to Ofcom by Channel 4 show that the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, also tried to send a deputy because of her commitment to appearing at first minister’s questions in Edinburgh on the same day, but was told that this would not be possible. Instead she dashed to the train from Holyrood and made it to the London studio just in time for the 7pm broadcast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab662e22afc342012cbf3b3a1cff9bddc59f5dc0/759_309_3779_2267/master/3779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69fffd573b695c4e9c5be8fe9e303bc2","title":"wheres the beef the chefs creating plant based meat alternatives","story":"From burgers to sausages, meat-free alternatives are gaining shelf space. Jason Deans meets Derek Sarno, the vegan chef creating them From roasts to ready meals, barbecues to takeaways, the meat we eat might be changing. The future? Decidedly higher in veg, if the numbers are to be believed.It’s a rapidly growing market and – helping as it does to create a more sustainable food supply system – one that makes clear ethical sense.It’s an interesting dichotomy, growing demand set against mixed perception, and one that supermarket chain Tesco is trying to tackle. It’s expanding its own-label plant-based ranges Wicked Kitchen and Plant Chef to more than 100 products, offering vegan substitutes to meat-based dishes ranging from cottage pie and southern fried chicken to Cumberland sausage, spaghetti bolognese and meatballs – and putting them in the meat aisle.The chain hired Derek Sarno to spearhead the shift, joining a dedicated Tesco team as its director of plant-based innovation – their mission to develop innovative (but affordable) vegan alternatives to meat.Sarno, a Veganuary ambassador, is co-founder with his brother Chad of Wicked Healthy, an online community promoting plant-based cooking. Motto: “We make vegan food for meat eaters.”Sarno moved from the US to London in 2017. Before he became a vegan, Sarno worked as a chef cooking meat dishes and he has since applied techniques he learned then to plant-based alternatives.Visiting UK supermarkets two years ago to check out what plant-based ready meals and food-to-go was on the shelves was bit of a culture shock. “When I first came to the UK as a vegan there was nothing for me to eat in the retail market apart from a falafel wrap,” Sarno recalls.There was a clear opportunity, both from a business and ethical point of view.“It’s the right thing to be doing,” says Sarno. “The whole thing about plant-based is it gives the customer a choice to actually do something with their money to buy the products that help,” he says.“There’s an ethical reason behind what I do, personally. But I understand any reason to have people eat more plant is a good reason, so I’m on board with all of it.”Sarno worked with long-standing Tesco suppliers Bakkavor and Samworth Brothers to launch the Wicked Kitchen own-brand range of vegan ready meals, sandwiches, salads, and pizzas, in January 2018. It has since expanded into desserts. Wicked Kitchen is already a £26m brand, according to Tesco, with 10m units shifted in 20 months.In September, Tesco launched a second plant-based own-brand range, Plant Chef, including Butternut Cauli Mac and Battered Fish-Free Fillets. Sarno describes Wicked Kitchen as “very innovative and chef-crafted”, comparable to Tesco’s higher-end Finest range while Plant Chef focuses on more accessible, affordable dishes and classic family favourites.Both Bakkavor and Samworth Brothers have decades of experience in the food business, but it still proved quite an eye opener sending their chefs out to the US to work with Sarno in his Portland home in 2017, buying vegetables in local farmers’ markets and taking them back to his kitchen to start the development process that led to the Wicked Kitchen and Plant Chef ranges.“One of Derek’s signatures is he’ll take the king oyster mushroom and then cook it between two cast iron frying pans and compress it as he’s cooking and it turns into something eventually that is like steak,” says Neil Rockliff, innovation director at Samworth Brothers.“What we learned with Derek’s input was to approach vegetables and almost treat them like meat. The veg butcher effect … How do we cut the vegetable in a different way to make it look different? How do we cook it in a different way, how could we pickle it, or cure it, or smoke it, and think about making it more interesting?”The challenge for both companies was to adapt Sarno’s techniques to create mass market plant-based products. Rockliff’s team came up with a system of loading marinated oyster mushrooms in large baking trays and then compressing, roasting and shredding them to use in ready meals or food-to-go. The company is also working with natural pea derivatives to give texture, moisture and enhance flavour, to help create meat-like products. It is using seaweed derivatives to provide a replacement for sausage skin.Similarly, Bakkavor has developed other meat-free methods including: charring and smoking tofu creating a plant-based mozzarella for pizzas “that will give a nice stringy effect” developing cream and milk alternatives with oat milk and using pickled, marinated vegetables such as celeriac as food-to-go fillings.Lewis agrees: “I don’t think we’ve seen anything like that in the last five years … I think the plant-based sector is just going to grow and grow. It’s the fastest growing category we work on.”By January, Tesco aims to have increased its plant-based offering to about 300 items, introducing dedicated plant-based and vegetarian zones in stores, and adding vegan products to fresh food, grocery, frozen and meat aisles.Rockliff adds: “We’re going to allow people, if they want to buy a prepared cottage pie, to have a meat version or a plant version. Same on sausages, same on burgers, etc, etc … From what I’m seeing, customers will have more and more choice between eating meat and choosing very credible meat alternatives that are simply made out of plants.”Plant powerWhether they’re interested in exploring plant-based “meat” for their health, the environment or simply variety, Tesco is set on giving its customers all the options to make healthier, more sustainable food choices. That’s why, as well as creating innovative meat alternatives, the supermarket is working with suppliers to modernise production and cut food waste.

By  John Harris and  John DomokosIf you do the kind of political journalism that involves talking to the general public, something faintly magical can sometimes happen. As events swirl around and you try to make sense of huge, complicated themes, a single conversation will bring everything into focus. And not via words alone: facial expressions, gestures, and the way inidual words are emphasised can give you a vivid sense of how people think, and the way their feelings could create political change. The encounter might be fleeting, but a connection can be made as one side understands, the other feels heard.Since 2010, we have been responsible for the  video series Anywhere But Westminster, in which we try to explore the gap between high politics and life as it is lived. With so much political coverage now based on opinion polling, we are interested not just in how people might vote, but what is behind their political choices. Vox pops have long been a crucial part of what we do.In the summer of 2014, our travels brought us to the town of Clacton-on-Sea in Essex. The local Conservative MP, Douglas Carswell, had resigned from his party and joined Ukip, then led by Nigel Farage. For us, the resulting byelection was a reason to visit the neighbourhood of Jaywick, which government statistics showed was the poorest place in England. It was here that we first got a sense of something potentially seismic. At that point, Ukip were largely understood as a new presence on the political right, who were appealing to habitual Tory voters. But things were shifting.When we arrive in a new place, the drill goes something like this. Find a location: a high street, or shopping parade maybe a residential street, or the entrance to a railway station. Acknowledge the awkward nature of what you are about to do, but get over your nerves, and grit your teeth. Survey the people you can see. Then find your first potential interviewee, switch the camera on, and begin: “Excuse me. We’re making a film. Do you mind if we talk to you for a bit?”In Jaywick, sitting on a bench on a raised step outside his house, was a retired man who had once been a railway worker in east London, and a member of Aslef, the train drivers’ union. We shared his company for a quarter of an hour. Just about everything he said highlighted the unexpected turns politics was suddenly taking, and we have returned to the footage we shot time and again. Sometimes, we don’t ask for people’s names (it can make people feel a bit like they’re being interrogated), so we have always referred to him as “Step Man”. Our exchange began when we showed him one of Carswell’s campaign leaflets.John Harris: “So you’ve had one of these through your door?”JH: “What do you think of him, and the fact that he’s left the Conservative party?”SM: “Good for him. It’s about time somebody got up and spoke.”JH: “Right now, what’s wrong with Britain?”SM: “Well, nobody’s doing anything are they? It’s all going around in circles. They do bugger all.”JH: “Have they done anything for Jaywick lately?”SM: “Nothing gets done for bloody Jaywick.”SM: “Everything. Look at the roads. Look at the state of it. The alleyways, look. Look at it all. We’re a backwater, aren’t we? That nobody gives a shit about.”JH: “Who did you used to vote for in the past?”JH: “And what changed?”SM: “Well, bloody Blair. Let’s face it, he did sod all for this country … And now he’s in Europe, pissing about there, making millions. He went more Conservative than the Conservatives.”SM: “Well, yeah. But he wants to make a few changes.”JH: “Do you think he’ll help Jaywick?”JH: “Time was, Labour was the party of the working man, eh?”SM: “Course it was. Course it was.”SM: “Bloody Thatcher got in – destroyed it, didn’t she? Done the working classes, didn’t she? Pissed the miners off. Done the railways. She pissed us all off, big time.”JH: “But Ukip’s full of people who think Mrs Thatcher was the bee’s knees.”SM: “I don’t suppose he is. Nobody is, are they?”JH: “But somebody with your politics shouldn’t be voting for him.”Vox pops have a long history. A US radio series of that name began in 1932, sampling people’s opinions about the presidential election that would bring Franklin Roosevelt to power. In 1961, an influential French documentary titled Chronique d’un été (Chronicle of a Summer) based a whole film around asking people on the street a simple but provocative question: “Are you happy?” Vox pops were popularised on British TV by the trailblazing presenter Alan Whicker (“I went out with my cameras into the monstrous avenues of Houston, stopped passersby and asked whether they owned a gun – I discovered it wasn’t a question of yes or no, but how many,” he once said). By the time we started doing them, they were an established part of TV news packages – the bit that usually comes near the end to show some “extra views of the subject matter in hand”, to quote one set of BBC guidelines.But Step Man represented something different. In the footage of our conversation, interviewer and interviewee are sitting at the same level, instead of a TV crew being ranged in formation against their quarry. The interview turns into an exchange between equals, and by the end, the power structure is reversed. In effect, Step Man told us not only that the old political certainties are dying, but also that a different kind of political journalism is called for. Reporters needed to go to places outside the traditional centres of power. The story must be dictated, not by a script they bring with them, but by what they find when they get there.The initial spark for Anywhere But Westminster was the headache-inducing tedium of covering party conferences. The first time we worked together, in the autumn of 2009, we walked out of Labour’s annual gathering in Brighton and asked members of the public what they thought of the party’s sudden fixation with a group of voters termed “the squeezed middle”. In response, people talked about their exasperation with such phrases (“I’m working-class,” said one man, “why’s it always about the middle?”), and their overwhelming sense of distance from an event that was happening only a few minutes away.With the arrival of the coalition government in 2010, we believed there was a damaging estrangement between politics and the public. We decided to put this alienation at the centre of our work, and started travelling around the country, talking to ordinary people in places that were rarely visited by journalists, TV news crews or political reporters. The after-effects of the financial crash of 2008 had yet to make an impact on British politics, and the UK seemed locked into certainties that had prevailed since the 1990s. Viewed from on high, a lot of voters seemed either uninterested in politics or sufficiently becalmed that they would behave mostly as the main parties expected. But out in the country, dissent and resentment were bubbling away, and through the prism of vox pops, we were starting to understand what was happening. We talked to people who had strong opinions, but were often not the kind of voters who had either the time or inclination to make their voices heard via the traditional forums: party activism, public meetings, protest marches. As journalists employed by the , we needed to be fair and balanced, but not necessarily impartial. We were trying to expose our viewers to opinions they were probably not used to hearing. Our own views came into the conversations we had, and made these exchanges more equal, authentic and spontaneous.The people we met during this initial period have been stuck in our heads for years. From 2011: the two young men selling paintball sessions in central Birmingham – one of them just back from military duty in Afghanistan – who were lucky to even make the minimum wage, and completely detached from politics. In 2013: the two older men in Merthyr Tydfil who answered our questions about the death of Margaret Thatcher by telling us they still thought about the 1980s miners’ strike “every day”, and a 17-year-old student who did not know what a trade union was. In 2014 we met Debbie, a young mum from a council estate in Falkirk, Scotland. At a packed pro-independence public meeting on a Sunday night, she told us that the referendum had ignited her interest in politics for the first time. It had been, she said, “One of the most exciting things that’s ever happened.”Standard TV news packages tend to be scripted by the reporter, and vox pops are added to show what the public think of the story that’s just been told. For us, although we always pre-arranged some encounters, vox pops were the first thing we did when we hit town. The views we encountered then guided a lot of what we did. We asked the people we met where we should go next, or who else we should meet. If a conversation with someone was particularly interesting, we would take their number, with a view to meeting them again.The films we were making were shaped by what we ined from talking to people, rather than the other way round. When we spoke to people for any length of time, our questions tended not to begin with “Who are you going to vote for?” or “What do you think about Brexit?”, but much more open, contextual lines of enquiry: “What’s it like living here?” or “How do you feel about the future?” We did not wear suits, or carry off-puttingly cumbersome equipment, or shine lights in people’s faces. If the interviewee had the time, the conversation often lasted for 10 or 15 minutes.Never seen Anywhere But Westminster?

John Harris finds out why politics isn\u0027t speaking to people there.As we spoke to people, we sensed that the gap between politics, the media and the public was widening. It was also becoming unsustainable. “They’re all in it for themselves, they don’t care about us” may have become the great cliche of vox pop journalism. But before it was a cliche, it was a warning.From the early 1990s until around 2010, mainstream debate was personified by such politicians as Tony Blair and Bill Clinton: men with an alleged genius for understanding public sentiment, and manipulating it. But since then, politics has been upended. Within a couple of years of David Cameron taking power, an often angry and unpredictable public was starting to render the usual rituals – big speeches, appearances on daytime TV – increasingly useless. Now, three years after Cameron left the stage, voters increasingly set the agenda. Not surprisingly, the vox pop – the literal “voice of the people” – has itself become the focus of angry debate.Last month, an Ofcom review found that many viewers thought the use of vox pops in the BBC’s news and current affairs coverage gave more prominence to extreme views at the expense of the “middle ground”. On Twitter you will find hundreds of tweets expressing exasperation with the form. There is a certain irony in people who habitually sound off online taking issue with other people voicing their opinions, but that doesn’t seem to stem the torrent: “I’m fed up of seeing vox pops of closet racist Dave from Blackpool and closet xenophobe Tony from Skegness.” “Ban all vox pops on the news. I really don’t care what Pete the electrician from Stoke-on-Trent thinks about constitutional law.” “Another day, another set of BBC vox pops from a load of pensioners at a ballroom dance.”In March this year, as Theresa May’s Brexit deal collided with parliament, the writer and comedian David Baddiel expressed his dismay on Twitter: “BBC News are once again doing that thing: ‘We sent our reporter to … a Leave constituency, always. Because that’s where people will be crossest. Which they think makes for better vox pops.”Back in 2017, The Radio Times published a piece by the columnist Alison Graham: “If I were Queen of the world I would draw up an Act of Parliament on fancy notepaper banning television vox pops from the minute an election is called until the result is declared. Then I’d give myself emergency powers to ban them for an unspecified period after that, too. Then I’d hope that in a world where, thanks to social media, no opinion ever goes unexpressed in a torrent of online detritus, vox pops will surely, finally, be dead.”But there are questions to be asked about how vox pops are used, and what they say about the media’s attitudes to so-called ordinary people. These interviews come at the end of a package – suggesting that the substance of the story has already been largely decided – and follow a basic formula: one for, one against, and one comedy reply.The superficial presentation of people’s views in hasty vox pops is a key part of one of the biggest political stories of our time. In Britain and elsewhere, a constructed idea of “the people” is now both central to events, and deeply problematic. The new breed of populist leaders use public appeal to justify a politics of ision and nastiness. The same reductive approach is common to Nigel Farage, Donald Trump, the Italian politician Matteo Salvini. Want to keep out immigrants? Build a wall. Fear for the nation’s social fabric? Classify incomers by usefulness, according to the “Australian-style points system”. This kind of politics never deals substantially with the complicated, difficult stuff woven into a lot of people’s sense of grievance – deindustrialisation, housing shortages, a world that has long since started moving into an era of automation and insecurity. In the populist worldview, “the people” are one-dimensional so are the solutions. When the Conservatives won a parliamentary majority, there was a great deal of soul-searching among the editors, reporters and commentators who had been taken by surprise. Some theories held that there had been specific problems with the pollsters’ methodologies (over-weighting particular groups of Labour voters, underestimating “shy Tories”). There was also general acknowledgement in the media that political journalism had relied too much on data, and not enough on qualitative conversations with voters.But something else was going on. In left-leaning political circles, people wondered how they had not seen the Tory victory coming. Part of the explanation came from an effect of social media, identified by the internet activist Eli Pariser in 2011 as the “filter bubble”: an effect of endless personalisation, which, he said, “moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see.”We were not aware of it at the time, but doing vox pops had become a way of bursting our bubbles. By going to locations we wouldn’t normally visit, and allowing random chance to dictate who we spoke to, we had rediscovered some kind of antidote to the data-driven approach of polling and the algorithms of social media.But by the end of that year, it was our turn for some soul-searching. A December byelection in Oldham West and Royton was the first test for the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn. We arrived in town buoyed by the sense that we had successfully ined the likely result of the election, and by our early coverage of the rise of Corbynism. It was raining torrentially for much that day, which makes for harder work than usual. We took cover in an indoor market, and got to work talking to people. We were shocked by the hostility towards Corbyn among older Labour voters in our minds, the force of their opinions signified a serious possibility that the party would lose the seat.In fact, Labour won with a majority of more than 10,000. We learned several lessons. First, predicting political outcomes was a mug’s game. Second, we had been guilty of creating our own filter bubble, by relying too much on a particular type of voter found in a particular place. Statisticians call this “availability bias”. In simple terms, you can’t base political coverage only on the sort of people you find in a market in the middle of the day.In May 2016, the referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU was looming. Polls were tight, but the general consensus was that the remain side would win. As we began a new series of Anywhere But Westminster, we were determined not to repeat our own mistakes. We spent a week driving from Merthyr Tydfil (we like it there – people talk) to Manchester, via the English Midlands. We had nothing set up: our only aim was to speak to as wide a variety of voters in as wide a variety of places as possible.We listened to Labour-voting leavers in Merthyr, and wealthier Eurosceptic Tory supporters in Leominster, Herefordshire. In the inner-city neighbourhood of Handsworth in Birmingham, we got a sense that assumptions of a remain victory were by no means well founded. There, we tested the received view of Brexit as a cause that only appealed to a certain kind of white person. At that point, many people were describing the respective sides of the battle as “in” and “out”. In a downpour, we spotted a British-Asian man taking shelter, wound down the car window, and asked him which side he was on. “Out,” he shot back. In Soho Road, the multicultural thoroughfare that is Handsworth’s main drag, we talked to Sikh business owners – who, in defiance of the facts, seemed to think that people from EU countries were a drain on the state and on taxpayers, and other people whose support for Brexit seemed to be down to the decay and decline they saw in their immediate environment.We then went up the M6 to Manchester. At a university recruitment fair, 10 vox pops turned up only one leave supporter. When we asked them how they felt about the future, most of the students we met were optimistic. But 15 minutes drive away, in the deprived northern Mancunian neighbourhood of Collyhurst, the polarities were reversed. “I fear for the kids – for my grandkids and that,” said one woman. “Jobs, and things like that: so I’m looking at pulling out.”Her neighbour had come to the UK from Malawi. “I’m looking at immigration,” he said. “I studied environmental health, and I can’t even get a job. As a person that came into the UK, I’ve seen the change. I know what is happening. It’s affected me. And the thing is … I’m pulling out.”We stopped to talk to two women next to a burned-out pub called the Billy Greens. Close by was an abandoned playing field, where rusty goalposts protruded from an expanse of overgrown grass. The conversation was brief, but it got to the heart of how the leave campaign had managed to frame its campaign as the vehicle for an unlikely kind of class war.Woman 1: “Collyhurst is coming up again. It’s a really nice place to live. But we do need more money spent on it.”JH: “Have people in power talked about spending money here?”W1: “They’ve had the gardens done, but that’s it. Nothing else. There’s nothing for the kids to do. Nothing for the kids to play on. Nothing at all. And yet it’s a lovely place to live.”JH: “But booming, thriving Manchester’s only 10 minutes’ drive down there.”W1: “Years ago, when I grew up here, there were places to go: playschemes, and everything. There’s nothing for kids. Nothing at all. You can look round and see.”JH: “It’s home, though, right? You feel very connected to it.JH: “What I find odd coming here, is that they’ve spent millions of pounds regenerating the middle of Manchester … ”JH: “But you haven’t had money spent here.”John Domokos: “I’m curious about why you think that happens: all the money gets spent there, not here.”Woman 1: “It’s people with money. People with money. Money talks!”JH: “Last question. How are you voting in this referendum?”W1 and W2, loudly and emphatically: “Out!”JH: “They’re all voting ‘in’ in town.”JH: “So it’s down to a very simple thing for you – those who’ve got money vote which way?”JH: “And those who haven’t got as much money?”W1: “To come out.”We didn’t predict the referendum result. But for us, the film that finished in Collyhurst helped to frame what had happened. Lots of analysis and data since that referendum has cast doubt on the idea that Brexit was some kind of working-class revolt. But all across Britain, in neglected places that rarely saw TV cameras, we had met people who were voting to leave the EU as a way of calling for change: to be heard. The idea of listening to the “left behind” briefly took hold, and found its way into Theresa May’s early speeches as prime minister. It felt to us like Brexit might be a turning point for Britain, and that the vox pop was somehow part of what was changing.A year later, Theresa May called the general election of 2017. Mostly because we had never been there, we decided to begin our coverage in the Cornish town of Redruth, where the last Cornish tin mine had closed 20 years earlier. Partly because tin is a crucial component in smartphones and electric cars, there had recently been talk of reopening the mine, something that seemed to interest a lot more people than party politics. The campaign had yet to ignite: the people we spoke to seemed largely detached from it, and the few people we could persuade to talk specifics said they would be voting Conservative.Theresa May was ahead in the polls, and there was a sense that right-leaning Brexit supporters would have things their way. But as we kicked our heels on an almost deserted, pedestrianised street, a man on a mobility scooter came into view, and clocked our camera. He would identify himself only as “the tin man”.Tin Man: “Are you making a film about the deprivation in this country? This fascist shithole?”JH: “Is it that bad?”TM: “Well, don’t you think it’s that bad? Or do you not see it as it is? If you fell down dead now, mate, no one would give a shit. Isn’t that a sign of a fascist country?”JH: “I meet a lot of people who seem quite cheered up, because they voted Brexit and we’re getting out and things are going their way.”TM: “Yeah, brilliant. Prices are going up, and it’s costing another $30m to reopen the tin mine because of the fall in the pound. This wonderful country doesn’t manufacture anything any more. We’re totally reliant on Swedish mining equipment, which is costing us more money. It’s not helping us, mate. People have been conned.” JH: “Do you have a meaningful option in this election, do you think?”TM: “Absolutely. For the first time ever I think we’ve genuinely got a choice.”JH: “And the choice is?”TM: “To do things differently. There are countries that do things differently. I want to vote against crony capitalism. And the only way to do that is to vote for someone like Jeremy Corbyn.”JD: “What’s it like being disabled in the current climate?”JD: “The crux of this is … ”JH: “We met a woman down there who said she thought Jeremy Corbyn was dangerous.”TM: “That’s just ridiculous, isn’t it? He’s a man who wants to change things for the better. Change the priority. Stop spending money on bloody war, feed and clothe the poor. Not one person excluded, yeah? And then we can start to progress as a species, for the first time ever.”We met the Tin Man when Labour were 15 points behind in the polls. The encounter with him was cut into a short standalone video that was posted on Facebook. It quickly amassed 2.2m views, and he was the subject of a story in the Camborne and Redruth Gazette. Labour came within 1,500 votes of winning the seat.Now another election is looming, and we are still doing vox pops. But in the course of the last three years or so, encounters between the media and the public have been so built into the Brexit moment that they have become ritualised.In terms of the sheer amount of vitriol, mistrust, mocking memes and conspiracy-mongering, we are arguably in the middle of Britain’s first true social-media election. In some ways, Twitter is one giant vox pop. But there are crucial differences. Most people don’t have a huge Twitter following. And the things that make vox pops both revealing and satisfying are absent: all context and local surroundings, all the non-verbal communication that humans use to signal respect and empathy.One thing seems particularly striking while going back through our archive of roughly 140 films, and probably more than 1,000 hours of footage: almost all of our encounters have ended on friendly terms. No matter what political differences come to the surface, the encounters usually proceed respectfully – that’s how people tend to behave when they come face to face.Ten years of vox-popping has taught us that calling the results of elections is not our job. But if Anywhere But Westminster has one key purpose, it is to at least try to transcend the polarisation and mutual loathing. At the risk of sounding sentimental, we want people to listen to each other.Two weeks ago, after we had finished filming in Southend-on-Sea, we drove the 30 miles to Jaywick, and went back to find Step Man. At the local convenience store, the woman behind the counter told us that people in Jaywick now hated the media: there had been too many programmes, she said, reducing it to a caricature of deprivation. The worst, she said, had been a Channel 5 show titled Benefits By the Sea. It was surprisingly easy to locate his house: the same red car was parked outside, and the bench was still there, propped against the wall. But when we rang the bell, there was at least two minutes of complete silence, before an upstairs window opened. There he was: paler and more gaunt before, and half-hidden behind the pane. We spoke for 10 minutes.JH: “Hello. I don’t know whether you remember us. Five years ago, we were making a film in Jaywick. We spoke to you on that bench there.”JH: “Can we talk to you again?”SM: “Not really. I’m not very well at the moment. I’ve got emphysema.”JH: “What do you think of the state of the country?”JH: “Do you think things are better or worse than when we met you five years ago?”JH: “Did you vote in the referendum?”SM: “Of course I did. And I voted to leave.”JH: “How do you feel about that?”SM: “Well, I want to be out. Nobody seems to know what they’re doing.”SM: “Oh, the same old same old. Nothing seems to change in Jaywick. Jaywick just rattles along. Like the rest of the country.”JH: “Are you going to vote in the election?”SM: “Of course I am.”JH: “Who are you going to vote for?”SM: “I’ve voted Labour all my life, and I’m not going to vote for Corbyn. He’s not doing the working classes any good at all.”JH: “So if not him, who are you going to vote for?”JH: “God – you’re a lifelong Labour voter, voting for Boris?”SM: “Yeah, because I want to get out of bloody Europe.”JH: “But what’s he going to do to the country?”SM: “Well, I don’t know. But as long as he gets us out of the mire.”JH: “Eton-educated, very wealthy … ”SM: “I wish I was. But they need to get it all sorted.”JH: “And the future of the country? How do you feel about that?”SM: “Well, I’d love to see it blossom. The poor having a few bob in their pocket. Pensioners doing well. All looked after. Hospitals. None of this … Every time you go into hospitals, hanging about in corridors – I’ve been there many, many times. Friday and Saturday night – all these arseholes who’ve had too many shandies, cluttering it all up, and people lying on trolleys, here there and everywhere.”JH: “And you’ve had that experience?”SM: “Yes.

The estimates are based on wealth reports produced by Forbes magazine and Credit Suisse.“This report should shock anyone who cares about the state of the UK today,” said Dr Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the Equality Trust. “Such a huge gap between the very rich and the vast majority of the country is dangerous. Such extreme wealth in the hands of so few people demonstrates just how broken the economic system is.“Behind the numbers, the UK’s extreme inequality is the story of Ferraris and food banks. Families across the country are working for their poverty and unable to promise their children a better, secure future. The rich live longer and their children get the best education, the best jobs and a leg up on the housing ladder. The UK’s economy delivers billions for a few and poverty for millions. Destitution is the sad reality for millions this Christmas.”Tackling inequality has become a key battle ground in the general election campaign, with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, vowing that a Labour government would go after super-rich people who exploit a “rigged system” to benefit themselves at the expense of the many.Corbyn named five other members of “the elite” he would target if he becomes prime minister: Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct Crispin Odey, a hedge fund boss who made millions betting against the pound in the run-up to the EU referendum Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Sun and the Times Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster, who controls a large central London property empire and Ratcliffe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4fb7dd4ef1f3ee54827ead1df7bfe3bc054c9a1/0_43_2888_1732/master/2888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e7466c657722142cf7e022ee2634b1e","title":"ask us a question what do you want to know about the snp manifesto","story":"As part of a new series you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general electionOur political team are on hand to answer your questions about this election and we will be posting their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30 and 1.30pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.Libby Brooks, the ’s Scotland correspondent, will be answering your questions on Wednesday.

This week we’re examining that data to see how the parties are reaching out to different groups.Throughout the campaign we’ve been reviewing which adverts get the most attention. Some of the top performers have consistently been “Stop Brexit” ads from the Liberal Democrats, or other pro-Remain messages.The Liberal Democrats’ ads appear to have been targeted overwhelmingly at younger voters. Almost two thirds of views of Lib Dem campaign ads were from users aged between 18 and 34, according to a  analysis.Advertising only to younger voters is a risky strategy, since the conventional wisdom is that older voters are more likely to turn out on polling day.However the Lib Dem campaign has not been exclusively directed at 18- to 34-year-olds. Over the weekend the party launched a slew of adverts attacking Boris Johnson, which appear to have been viewed mostly by older users.The party launched several ads promoting its NHS policies in recent days, some of which have been viewed exclusively by male users, according to Facebook’s data.Over the weekend the Conservatives also repackaged a clip of a Sky News interview with Jeremy Corbyn about the London Bridge terrorist attack as a Facebook advert. At time of writing, three quarters of those who had viewed it were male.The ads includes a claim that Labour “want weaker sentences” for terrorism offences – in truth the party has made no such commitment.Our analysis shows that unlike the Lib Dems, with their focus on young voters, the Labour party have promoted their Facebook advertising much more broadly across all ages.Total spending on Facebook and Instagram adverts between the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Brexit party has now passed the £1m. The Tories are still spending relatively low amounts on the platform, though some have suggested that will change closer to polling day.While Labour do not appear to be particularly focusing on younger voters on Facebook, the party is by far the most successful on Snapchat, a platform which has a relatively young user base.Many Snapchat ads are promoting voter registration, targeting a younger demographic that has historically been less likely to vote. The biggest spender was not a political party but the non-partisan voter registration campaign Vote for your Future, which has spent £40,000 on 83 ads so far.Labour was the second biggest spender, taking out £25,000 worth of ads, almost eight times more than the Conservatives. Labour has placed just three ads during this time, but has received a total of 19m impressions, compared with the Conservatives’ 2m. Labour’s latest ad ran for three days up until the voter registration deadline, receiving almost 6m views.The Tories have not taken out any ads around voter registration and have not spent any money on the platform since 8 November.As we enter the last days of the campaign the Liberal Democrats have finally started placing ads on Snapchat. The party paid for 11 ads at just over £100 apiece, all placed on the same day, suggesting they are still in the testing phase.Data was gathered from the Facebook Ad Library API though keyword searches for the main political parties, restricting to ads served from midnight 29 October onwards. Facebook provides impressions in ranges. To calculate percentages of ad views, the age and gender distributions of each ad were multiplied by the lower bound of impressions. This was then summed by party and ided by the total lower bound of impressions for that party. Figures were correct as of 11:00 on Monday. Snapchat data covers the period 29 October to 29 November.Digital dashboard team: Michael Barton, Pamela Duncan, Niamh McIntyre, David Pegg and Joseph Smith."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11dce4226f88749335399778249ff2054197a6df/0_11_934_561/master/934.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9381aebe95db930871cda838d53c8e7","title":"uk general election 2019 poll tracker","story":"Find out who’s ahead in the opinion polls.

That didn’t mean the tourists could simply see out the match waiting for the heavens to open. Root will have wanted to sign off the start of this supposed new era with one last push.Yet a tour of many impotent periods in the field saw one final wicketless outing, during which came a particularly sorry loss of focus when Joe Denly dropped Kane Williamson on 62, en route to Test century No 21. It had onlookers instantly trying to work out if this was the worst they had ever seen, with Mike Gatting’s bungled effort off Kiran More in Madras 26 years ago the most-cited challenger here.Root looked nonplussed at the time and then later tried to laugh it off at the press conference, describing this looping chance at short mid-wicket, chiselled our by a fine bit of knuckle-ball trickery by Jofra Archer, as a “one-off goober” that Denly would be reminded of for some time. The only comfort came through its lack of consequence.But then it also summed elements of their downfall, not least with Archer the bowler denied this prized scalp during a promising final burst on a tour that has otherwise been an eye-opening first overseas assignment. It has also been one that, statistically, ranks as England’s least threatening in history by way of collective output.They took a wicket every 115.7 balls sent down which, according to the number-crunching statistician Andy Zaltzman, beat a previous worst strike-rate of 114.5 during the six-Test 1989 Ashes. An average of 56 runs per breakthrough was only mildly better.These were, it must be said, two grim flat pitches that many felt did the sport few favours by way of a spectacle. But then the seemingly indefatigable Neil Wagner still found a way, bending his back for 13 wickets at 19 runs apiece.Yet the Kookaburra ball remained kryptonite in English hands for long periods. Stuart Broad played the old pro, keeping the runs down and picking his moments, while Sam Curran and Ben Stokes never lacked for perspiration. The main plus came from Chris Woakes in the second Test, a seamer who came in cold by way of warm-up time and delivered the kind of overseas showing many thought beyond him,Denly’s blooper wasn’t the only drop on the last day to cause their collective final strike-rate. Williamson’s first life in the morning came on 39 when Ben Stokes, whose effort was commendable given a dicky knee, fired one into the New Zealand captain’s ribs. It took the glove, only for Ollie Pope to show up his emergency wicketkeeper role for the selectorial carelessness it was by grassing a ing yet regulation pouch down leg.Neither chance was as costly as the one put down at slip by Stokes in Mount Maunganui, when BJ Watling turned 31 into an ultimately series-winning double century. Williamson and Ross Taylor, who brought up his 19th Test century moments before the rain by sweeping two fours and a six off Root, were not playing a couple of match defining innings on the final day.Nevertheless, they were the fourth and fifth New Zealand batsmen to make centuries across the two Tests – Tom Latham and Mitch Santner the others – compared to England’s two. Root’s double-century was a bloody-minded return to the runs column and timely as regards the swirling debate over his captaincy, while Rory Burns will hopefully grow in confidence from his second at Test level.These came a Test match too late, however, the defeat at Bay Oval having consigned England to their first year without a series win since 1999 and thanks to a sub-par 353 all out of three unconverted half-centuries from Burns, Denly and Stokes.While England keep talking about the Ashes in 2021-22, New Zealand now fly to Perth this Saturday for a three-match series in Australia. This talented, humble and coherent Black Caps team – possibly their best – will still be underdogs though. When asked for his tip, Root replied: “I think they’ve got all the tools that can be successful out there.”It was one last compliment in a series that played out impeccably by way of relations between the two teams. At the same time, it also highlighted how much work Root’s men have to do if they are get theirs nearly as sharp."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/453bd4cdcc13d5a23dc7ffeebe6a9f2765db18b6/0_1045_4032_2417/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46aff981211134455d2cf9668cc211d6","title":"cricketer comic creator felix the ultimate all rounder the spin nicholas wanostrocht","story":"Under a pseudonym, Nicholas Wanostrocht made his mark by inventing bowling machines, protective gloves and moreThough by then he was well into his retirement, this attitude goes some way to explaining why Nicholas Wanostrocht, a former schoolmaster, felt compelled to play the game under the pseudonym Felix. Though the difficulties presented by the ownership of a name such as Wanostrocht probably contributed.Last week, under the flimsy pretext of commemorating the anniversary of the end of cricket’s distinction between the amateur and the professional, we crowbarred into The Spin a profile of the great Kent amateur Alfred Mynn. It seemed remiss to put the toolkit away before also commemorating Mynn’s teammate and occasional adversary Felix – cricketer, comedian, teacher, artist, musician and inventor.The cricket and the comedy often came together, Felix showing an uncanny ability to “keep the field in good humour by his attitudinising”, to quote one report – though one obituary criticised him for being “somewhat inclined to frivolity in the field”. “What a temper Mr Felix had! And what a laugh too,” wrote another great old teammate, Fuller Pilch, before telling the story of how he would horribly wind up William Lillywhite, a bowler so successful he earned the nickname ‘The Nonpareil’.“I never was, nor did I ever pretend to be, a great player,” Felix wrote. “I could play perhaps a little better than moderately well, but by no means well enough to be called a proficient.” Others would disagree. As Pilch said: “Mr Felix on his own day was my man. When he got to work and the ground and light suited him, it was a wonderful sight to see him bat. He knew the whole science of the game, and he had a hand and eye such as no one e’er beat him at.”Anyway, cricket was only a small fraction of what made Felix interesting. His mother died at 43, having had 21 children. Nicholas was one of only seven who reached adulthood, and as the oldest male heir took over the school his family ran, Alfred House, when he was 19. Both his parents died in quick succession. He was an excellent musician: according to legend he once attended a ball at a country house in Hampshire and, when the band went to supper, proved himself able to play with distinction every one of their instruments.He favoured the violin, but he also recalled of Mynn that “many a time I have drawn a tear from his beautiful blue eyes when he has requested me to play him some favourite air on my flute”. His drawings of fellow players were excellent, and he harboured a desire “to take my rank with some of the leading portrait painters of the day” which was scuppered only when “the introduction of photography put an end to any hopes of success”. He once painted a portrait of an ox so accurate a butcher who had seen it once at market was able to recognise the inidual animal.He was also a serial innovator. When he wanted alternative headgear to the then fashionable but in practice ludicrous top hat, he designed his very own cap. Though he was not the first player to wear pads, he came up with the idea of sewing linen sheaths into the inside of his trouser legs so as to make them invisible. “Long slips of Indian rubber, half an inch thick, can be inserted therein, and taken out as they go or come from the wash,” he enthused. He created the first protective gloves and decided not to patent them (so someone else did), and then there was his bowling machine, the Catapulta. The user placed a ball at the top of the machine, and an arm would swing up and thump it downfield, making contact much like a cue on a snooker ball. It could be set to deliver the ball “so fast that it would split your bat in two, or so slow it would scarcely reach the wicket”, and was so versatile one early report said the machine was “by means of a screw made to imitate the fast bowling of Sam Redgate”.Harrow school bought one to train their young players, as did Surrey. Some were sent over to India. Felix used his Catapulta to hone his defensive game, which at the start of his career had been a noted weakness but towards the end truly set him apart. “He is,” Arthur Haygarth wrote, “what is called a late player, that is to say, he did not begin to distinguish himself much in the great matches till he was about 30 years of age, he then however ran a most brilliant career”. He demonstrated his improved technique in June 1846, when he played a single-wicket match against Mynn, attracting “the most brilliant assemblage of spectators ever gathered” to Lord’s. Mynn scored five runs in his one innings Felix was dismissed without scoring in his first, but in his second he settled in for the long haul, facing 247 deliveries and scoring only three. It was, the Sporting Life later wrote, “one of the most brilliant specimens of batting ever remembered”.His first-class career ended in 1853, and four years later he suffered a stroke that severely limited his movement for the last 19 years of his life – if not his ability to write and paint. “Fortunately for me, I always possessed something of the nature of that soubriquet,” he wrote of his pseudonym, though he reverted to Wanostrocht in retirement. “Buoyant in spirit, full of careless ‘hope for the best’, I never would allow any calamity to weigh me down. Many a strong-minded man would have shrivelled into nothing if he had had to bear but half the anxieties which I could here unfold, but to which it would be tedious now to refer. Like an Indian rubber ball, I was no sooner down than the bounding spirit of ‘hoping for the best’ buoyed me up again.”• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

Twelve boys and their football coach were lost in a subterranean maze in the Tham Luong caves in Thailand. An international team of cave ers raced to rescue them before monsoon rains were due to flood the caves. The story was destined to be fodder for a Hollywood blockbuster – and that was before an eccentric billionaire got involved.On Tuesday, a postscript to the feelgood tale of the Tham Luang cave rescue will play out in a federal courthouse in Los Angeles, California, as the trial begins in a defamation case brought by the British caver Vernon Unsworth against Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk.Unsworth, a British national who lives in Thailand, was among the first ers to reach the scene of the boys’ disappearance. He was credited by rescuers for his detailed knowledge of the cave system, which helped locate the missing team.Musk had also attempted to assist with the rescue the chief of Tesla and SpaceX assigned a team of engineers to design a miniature submarine that he hoped could be used to guide the boys through underwater tunnels. Although Musk delivered the submarine to the rescue site, the boys were rescued by ers, one of whom died during the operation.Unsworth drew the ire of Musk following the rescue when he gave a brief interview to CNN and ridiculed his submarine, which he said “had absolutely no chance of working”. He added that Musk should “stick his submarine where it hurts”.The billionaire entrepreneur lashed out at Unsworth on Twitter, where he called the caver a “pedo guy” to his 22 million followers. Under intense criticism from the public and his company’s investors, Musk apologised and deleted the tweets, but he subsequently revived the baseless allegations in another series of tweets about a month later. Musk also alleged in another baseless allegation that Unsworth was a “child rapist” in an email to a BuzzFeed reporter.Tuesday’s trial follows a year of legal wrangling between Unsworth and Musk’s attorneys. Musk had attempted to have the case dismissed, arguing at one point that “pedo guy” is a common insult in his home country of South Africa and was not intended as an actual accusation of pedophilia. Court filings revealed that Musk had also hired a private investigator to attempt to substantiate his allegations against Unsworth.The US district judge Stephen Wilson ruled in November that Unsworth was not a public figure, lowering the bar for the cave explorer to prove that Musk had defamed him.The trial will start after jury selection on Tuesday. Potential jurors will be asked whether they hold strong opinions on billionaires or people who visit Thailand, Reuters reported. Once a panel of jurors is selected, Musk is expected to be the first witness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0390f706ce0839426bcdf4bf6dfdc53add15f34/0_1057_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f18ccc411b24d7b875326485dd9833ab","title":"floella benjamin interview kids tv presenter baroness","story":"She was the face of kids’ TV and became one of the most influential presenters ever. As Baroness Benjamin’s achievements are recognised, she looks back at the racism she overcame‘I’m here today because I love you.” That’s how Floella Benjamin, the children’s TV presenter turned advocate for children of all ages, usually begins. Sometimes she says those exact words. Sometimes, like today, she doesn’t have to. Thirty years in children’s TV, first as a presenter on Play School and later as head of her own production company, has made Benjamin adept at communicating not only with children but with the inner children of adults. It’s a skill that can make encounters unexpectedly emotional.“Caring,” she says, that’s the secret. “And meaning it. On Play School, I said, ‘Hello, are you all right?’” She pauses, but maintains eye contact, and suddenly I’m four again, sitting cross-legged and too close to the TV, as her benevolent face smiles out at me. “I’m giving the child a moment to answer back,” she explains. “Because many of the children watching were living in children’s homes, or weren’t loved, or were being abused, and they needed somebody. I made them understand that I loved them.”The feeling is plainly mutual. This Friday, Benjamin will receive the lifetime achievement prize at the Women in Film and Television awards. It is only the latest in a long list of honours that includes an OBE (2001), a special lifetime achievement Bafta (2004) and Freedom of the City of London (2018). Tom Hanks is starring in a film telling the semi-mystical story of Mister Rogers, Benjamin’s US equivalent, so perhaps her own Hollywood biopic is next?“You’d have to embellish it a bit,” says Keith, her husband of 40 years, who occasionally chips in with supportive words and specific dates. “We always say our life is boring.” Well, it isn’t boring, but certain scenarios do seem to recur. These days, when Benjamin isn’t on stage accepting an award at some fancy gala, she’s hidden in a quiet corner afterwards counselling and embracing a stranger, who may be sobbing. Except they’re never really strangers – they’re her “Play School babies”, all grown up now, with responsible, high-flying careers, yet still hungry for Benjamin’s approval. “Most of the ministers in parliament are my Play School babies,” she says with satisfaction.This is a matter of both pride and practical use in Benjamin’s position as a Lib Dem peer in the House of Lords, Baroness Benjamin of Beckenham. The Beckenham part has special significance. It was in this London suburb that her parents, whom she calls Marmie and Dardie, eventually settled, after arriving from Trinidad and sending for 10-year-old Benjamin and her siblings. The racism began before they’d even moved in: “They sent the police to arrest us – to say black people don’t live here. My mum said, “You know something, we’re going to live in this house!” And we lived there for 40 years.” After her peerage was announced in 2010, Benjamin visited her parents’ graves in Beckenham cemetery. “I said, ‘Marmie, Dardie, I’m going to claim Beckenham for you!’”She hasn’t always felt that love returned, however. Growing up, she was subjected to racist bullying and, on one memorable occasion, ridiculed by a teacher because of her Caribbean accent. “She said, ‘If you want to remain in my class, you have to learn to speak the Queen’s English.’” Benjamin was upset but, on the advice of her mother, complied. Some years later, she called upon the episode to escape an attempted sexual assault. “I turned and said to him, ‘How dare you! You guttersnipe!’ I morphed myself into my teacher, because I knew how she’d made me feel.”Benjamin’s anecdotes about her schooldays are typical of a nuanced-yet-practical approach to tackling racism, one that is sometimes misconstrued. Adapting is not about feeling ashamed of her roots – it’s the opposite. “I’m never afraid of expressing my true me,” she explains, “and people take it or leave it. But I also learned from that teacher what I needed to do if I wanted to engage with people. Anywhere I go in the world, I can become.”As chancellor of Exeter University during the 2012 Diamond Jubilee, she was charged with giving the Queen a guided tour. “We had a great time together. She told me stories about her family and shared ideas about life, children, food, everything. And I thought I’d share my story with her. I said, ‘You know, ma’am, when I was in Trinidad, I used to stand and sing God Save the Queen. I was told I was part of the Motherland. When I came to Britain, it wasn’t like that. I had to face so much adversity in Britain and so many barriers. But do you know? I don’t hate anybody, I don’t have any resentment in my heart.’” Her Majesty was moved, apparently. “She said to me, ‘When I’m speaking to you like this, it reminds me of when I was speaking to Nelson Mandela. He had the same philosophy.’”So the woman who was reprimanded for not speaking “the Queen’s English” went on to speak English with the actual Queen. Such is the trajectory of Benjamin’s life. “Every day I say, ‘Take me, show me, lead me, I’m yours,’” she says, turning her face upwards and closing her eyes, as if to bathe in the sunlight of another blessed day. Does she never feel defeated? “Nothing gets me.”Even the Windrush scandal couldn’t shake her faith in happy resolutions. Perhaps because, for a Caribbean-born British woman who lived through the 1960s, evidence of government hostility to immigrants is not “news”. When the first stories of deportations broke, Benjamin was already struggling to get funding for a Windrush-themed garden at the Chelsea Flower Show.“They couldn’t see the importance of it. Why should they? It wasn’t part of their schooling. So when the Windrush scandal happened, suddenly everybody knew! Everything happens for a reason. People were falling over themselves to be our sponsor and we won a gold medal. We had white, middle-class people coming up saying,” — she adopts her teacher’s voice again — “‘Oh, here’s the Windrush garden! I know all about Windrush!’ If people had understood the history, we wouldn’t have got to where we are.”On other issues, too, Benjamin is a reformer, not a revolutionary. Beginning with a polite enquiry as to why Play School’s story illustrations only featured white children, she has had several big successes. Most recently, she secured an amendment to encourage broadcasters to commission more quality children’s programming and she’s even sanguine about the rise of unboxing videos (people opening packaged products while describing what they find).“If children want to go and watch things on YouTube, fair enough. But I think if they’ve got quality programmes on the main channels, they’ll be watching those. Every moment matters to the child under seven. So if you’re giving them rubbish, they’re going to accept rubbish in life.”Still, Benjamin understands that not everyone was blessed with a Marmie and Dardie like hers. Which is why, even after four decades of passionate campaigning, there is still much work to be done on the causes closest to her heart: media ersity and children’s welfare. “Of course I find it frustrating,” she says. “I weep sometimes when I’m at home, but I’ve got a wonderful husband who knows just what I’m going through and how I’ve been trying to point out the lack of ersity. I’ve been told, ‘Shut up, you’ll never work again’, ‘Back off, who do you think you are?’ I’ve been told all of that – but I know eventually it will turn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b37a37f4ea6450c49ff96d06adec86cd83b9ef6f/25_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14738f2d5c818cc56cd64534da24d273","title":"prince andrew cant slink away from this now the tv triumph of virginia giuffre","story":"Calm, thorough and deeply plausible, Virginia Giuffre’s BBC interview was everything Prince Andrew’s wasn’t – and it made the severity of the accusations against him look undeniablePrince Andrew’s Newsnight interview quickly became more about him than the subject. Through no fault of Emily Maitlis’, Prince Andrew outed himself as such a lunk-headed idiot that the serious allegations against him retreated a little.When you think of that interview, you immediately think of Andrew’s volley of jaw-dropping explanations. His inability to sweat. His photographic memory of Woking Pizza Express. His tendency to be “too honourable”. You were watching a man who spent his life being held accountable for nothing attempt to skirt an important issue with the power of his bovine privilege alone, and failing hard. The interview became less about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and more about watching a man drive his own life off a cliff.And while the interview certainly had impact – it isn’t every day someone does so badly at Newsnight their mum fires them from their own family – it did mean the focus shifted away from the women at the centre of the allegations. Last night’s Panorama was a much-needed corrective.There was nothing flashy about The Prince and the Epstein Scandal. There were no stand-out lines, and no memes will come of it, but Virginia Giuffre managed to be everything Prince Andrew wasn’t. She was thorough where Andrew was evasive. She was determined where Andrew panicked. She sat with the weight of her accusations where Andrew ignored them. Her proximity to Epstein left her with nothing. Andrew’s left him with everything to lose. More than anything, Giuffre looked like a person a real, flesh and blood person who had spent at least some of her life dealing with the consequences of something. She was Andrew’s opposite in every way.This was a much more muted hour of television than Newsnight. Newsnight let Prince Andrew tie his own shoelaces together and watched him fall, but this is what made sure he’ll never get up again. Facts and inconsistencies were fastidiously laid out one after the other. Different voices – victims, lawyers, former heads of royal protection – were piled up until the severity of the accusations against Andrew became undeniable. This isn’t something he can slink away from any more. This isn’t going to go anywhere.Smartly, Panorama also used Andrew’s interview in key moments, just to highlight its utter stupidity. The emotional climax of the episode came at the halfway point. Giuffre described what it was like to be abused by a member of the royal family – where it happened, how long it lasted, what it felt like, her subsequent feelings of powerless and shame – before breaking down when she attempted to understand it. “I couldn’t comprehend how the highest levels of the government and powerful people were allowing this to happen,” she wept. “Not only allowing it to happen but participating in it.” Her anguish was perfectly evident. Cut to Andrew on Newsnight, eyes darting around beneath his sheen of privilege, telling Maitlis that “I can absolutely, categorically tell you it never happened.”Although it aired afterwards, Giuffre was interviewed for Panorama before Prince Andrew’s Newsnight episode was recorded. Perhaps that’s for the best now she must be taken seriously. The lasting impression of Giuffre was her immense bravery in facing such towering institutions alone. The sheer strength she possesses is incredible. Forget Prince Andrew when the dust settles on this, she’s the one who deserves to be remembered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e7952225bb3bc0439673785f606c3327001f33d/0_0_3583_2150/master/3583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba58a38724f88e247ebe256ea8480b4c","title":"mugabe left 10m a farm and five houses says state media","story":"Modest inventory greeted with scepticism in Zimbabwe, where dictator was thought to have amassed fortune over 40 yearsRobert Mugabe left $10m (£7.7m) in the bank, some small plots of land and a handful of modest properties, a list of his estate published by a state-owned newspaper in Zimbabwe has shown.The report of the relatively limited fortune of the late dictator, published on Tuesday, was greeted with scepticism by many in the poverty-hit southern African country.Mugabe, who died in August aged 95, was thought to have amassed a portfolio of investments worth hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, over his near four-decade rule.The most recent list was revealed when Mugabe’s daughter Bona Chikowore wrote to legal officials seeking to register her father’s estate, which she said included $10m held in a local bank, four houses in the capital, Harare, 10 cars, a farm, his rural home and an orchard, the Herald newspaper reported.Mugabe is born in what was then British-ruled Southern Rhodesia. He is educated at Catholic schools and attends South Africa\u0027s University of Fort Hare. During the 1940s and 50s he teaches in Zambia and Ghana, where he is influenced by African independence movement leaders.After campaigning for Zimbabwe\u0027s independence, he is imprisoned for political agitation. While incarcerated, he earns two law degrees from the University of London.\u0026nbspReleased from prison, he escapes to Mozambique where Zimbabwe African National Union guerrilla fighters elect him to lead their struggle against white minority rule.Mugabe\u0027s Zanu-PF party wins independent Zimbabwe\u0027s first election and he takes office as prime minister.Mugabe deploys North Korean-trained troops to crush an insurgency by former guerrillas loyal to his liberation war rival Joshua Nkomo. Government forces are accused of involvement in the killing of 20,000 civilians, which Mugabe denies.\u0026nbspMugabe becomes president with sweeping executive powers after changes to the constitution and signs a unity pact with Nkomo, who becomes one of his two deputies. In 1990, Zanu-PF and Mugabe win further parliamentary and presidential elections.An economic crisis marked by high interest rates and inflation sparks riots.Zimbabweans reject a new constitution in a referendum, Mugabe\u0027s first defeat at the ballot box. Thousands of independence war veterans and their allies, backed by the government, seize white-owned farms, saying the land was illegally appropriated by white settlers.\u0026nbspThe US puts a financial freeze on Mugabe\u0027s government in response to land seizures, beginning a wave of sanctions against his regime.Mugabe wins a disputed presidential vote, which observers condemn as flawed.\u0026nbspZimbabwe is suspended from the British Commonwealth over accusations of human rights abuses and economic mismanagement.Hyperinflation reaches 500bn per cent, forcing millions of people to leave the country.\u0026nbspMugabe loses a presidential vote but wins the run-off after opponent Morgan Tsvangirai withdraws, citing violence against his supporters. A power-sharing agreement is signed.\u0026nbspDespite reports saying Mugabe has been seriously ill with cancer, he wins another disputed presidential vote. Western observers cite multiple accounts of electoral fraud.\u0026nbspAfter protesters stage the biggest show of defiance against Mugabe in a decade, he is forced to resign following an army coup and is replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa.No will has yet been found and there has been no other declaration of Mugabe’s wealth, or that of his second wife, Grace, nor of his sons and other relatives.The former guerrilla leader, who took power in 1980 and ruled for decades, was buried in September in his rural home town of Kutama.The final burial place  caused tension between the government, which wanted him to be interred at the National Heroes Acre, a hilltop shrine in Harare, and his family.When he was ousted from power in November 2017, Mugabe was given a generous state pension and a retirement package that included a pension, housing, holiday and transport allowance, health insurance, limited air travel and security.Some of the Mugabe family wealth has been exposed by a series of legal quarrels. One, between Grace Mugabe and a Belgian-based businessman over a $1.3m diamond ring, lifted a veil on the lifestyle of his widow, nicknamed “Gucci Grace” for her reputed dedication to shopping. The family is believed to have an extensive portfolio of luxury homes overseas. In 2015, a dispute revealed their ownership of a $7.6m home in Hong Kong.The ruling Zanu-PF party said in October it planned to transfer ownership of the sprawling mansion in Harare where Mugabe lived until shortly before his death to the family. The house is worth several million dollars.The Mugabes are also thought to own more than a dozen farms. Several are in Mazowe, about 40km (25 miles) north of Harare. One, belonging to Grace Mugabe, has been the centre of a recent land dispute.A 2001 US diplomatic cable, later released by WikiLeaks, said that while reliable information was difficult to find, there were rumours that Mugabe’s assets “include everything from secret accounts in Switzerland, the Channel Islands and the Bahamas to castles in Scotland”.The news of the Mugabes’ wealth comes as Zimbabwe plunges further into a humanitarian crisis. The UN food agency said on Tuesday it was procuring 240,000 tonnes of food assistance to deliver to 4.1 million people in the former British colony where food shortages are being exacerbated by runaway inflation and drought induced by climate change.“We are very much concerned as the situation continues to deteriorate,” Eddie Rowe, World Food Programme country director, speaking from Harare, told a news briefing in Geneva. The country, once the breadbasket of Africa, is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a decade, marked by soaring inflation and shortages of food, fuel, medicines and electricity. The aid will be for January to June, Rowe said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e080b6431070e008ed84c1310fe8b7524aca0075/208_0_3474_2085/master/3474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd0af2f6c32312a4d91edb992a250ff7","title":"putin approves law targeting journalists foreign agents","story":"Move described by rights activists as scare tactic to stifle criticism of Russian governmentVladimir Putin has signed a law that will allow Russia to declare journalists and bloggers as “foreign agents” in a move critics say will allow the Kremlin to target government critics.Under the vaguely worded law, Russians and foreigners who work with media or distribute their content and receive money from abroad would be declared foreign agents, potentially exposing journalists, their sources, or even those who share material on social networks to foreign agent status.The move has been described by journalists and human rights activists as a scare tactic to further stem criticism of Putin’s government.In an open letter published last week, more than 60 prominent journalists, writers and activists urged the president not to sign the law.“‘Foreign agent’ is a persistent phrase with a sharply negative character,” the letter reads. “The label of foreign agent discredits a person in the eyes of his fellow citizens and disparages his dignity despite the fact that he has done nothing wrong or illegal and did not carry out the will of any foreign employers.”Alexei Venediktov, the editor of the popular Echo of Moscow radio station, said the law was in part prompted by this summer’s protests, the largest in years, sparked by the state’s heavy-handed control over municipal elections.“This is the story of a selective attack for total fear and to create obstacles for protesters, above all the media, which report on protests, using all available information,” he said in an interview with Znak. “This is yet another tool, it is clear, understood, demonstrated and brazen.”Russia’s register of foreign agent media has 10 entries, all of them outlets tied to either Radio Free Europe or Voice of America, which receive funding from the US.But Russia’s government has also harshly criticised other foreign media for reporting on the demonstrations, including suggesting it could revoke German broadcaster Deutsche Welle’s accreditation for sharing a map of the planned route for an unsanctioned protest in August.Russia’s foreign agent law was developed after large anti-Putin protests in 2012 and has largely targeted NGOs. In November, the country’s supreme court ordered the liquidation of the veteran human rights activist Lev Ponomarev’s For Human Rights NGO, resulting in the organisation being shut down in Russia and removed from the country’s register of legal entities. It was expanded to include media in 2017."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4103451.1575389288!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"d%C3%A1il expenses regime far too lax says varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMr Varadkar told the Dáil that ‘it is a system that’s essentially designed by politicians for politicians’.  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has acknowledged that the Dáil expenses system is “far too lax” and should not be run by politicians.Instead he called for it to be handed over and run independently by the Standards in Public Office Commission.Mr Varadkar told the Dáil that “it is a system that’s essentially designed by politicians for politicians and that should change”.The Taoiseach said he would be writing to party leaders and the Ceann Comhairle “to suggest that this whole issue is not one that should be run for ourselves by ourselves and it should be handed over to the standards commission”.Fine Gael has been engulfed in controversy over the revelation that former minister of State Dara Murphy collected his full allocation of Dáil expenses despite being primarily based in Brussels for the past two years where he has had a full-time paid position as the European People’s Party’s director of elections for most of that time.Mr Murphy is set to resign his Dáil seat, possibly later this week, and become the “cabinet expert” for Bulgarian commissioner Mariya Gabriel, with an expected annual salary of €150,000.A Dáil committee has been asked to investigate a complaint about Mr Murphy’s Dáil attendance record but will be unable to do so once the Cork North-Central deputy resigns his position.The Taoiseach reiterated that he had spoken to Mr Murphy over the weekend and “he is willing to co-operate with any investigation by any statutory body into his attendance in Dáil Eireann, whether it’s the ethics committee, the members’ interests committee of the standards in office commission”.Ms McDonald referred to the letter in The  by homeless charity founder Fr Peter McVerry who wrote of attending court with a young homeless boy charged with the theft of a bottle of orange valued at €1, of a homeless man charged with the theft of four bars of chocolate valued at €3 and of another charged with the theft of two packets of Silk Cut cigarettes.“And he contrasts that with a TD on his way to or from a very highly paid double job in Brussels who stops by at the Dáil to sign in so that he can collect his full €51,600 of expenses for attendance at a Dáil that he does not in fact attend.”Mr Varadkar congratulated Ms McDonald on her party’s “get out the vote operation” in Dublin Mid-West where Sinn Féin’s Mark Ward won the seat.“We will not be caught off guard on that on the next next occasion,” he added and insisted it was “not begrudgery at all” when he was heckled for his remark.Sharp exchangesHe said a “get out the vote operation is a great thing” and a “genuine compliment” but he took a swipe at her party when he said “you should not overanalyse your success. Across the four byelections my party won many more votes than yours did so it’s certainly no endorsement of your policies”.But he said the expenses system needed to change. “And the next Dáil should have a different regime when it comes to expenses and . . . verifying attendance and that should be done independently and separately of this House and the time we make rules for ourselves should end.”Dara Murphy is expected to be present for the vote of confidence in Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy in the Dáil on Tuesday night. And Ms McDonald said he would make a “guest appearance” to “save the bacon of your failed housing Minister”.She said the people deserve better than the politics of nod and winks for the boys and a Minister who lacks “humility to admit his housing policy has failed”.She said workers and families delivered a damning verdict on the Government’s housing failures in the four byelections."},{"url":null,"title":"the amazing epic tale of the indian jungle prince","story":"On a spring afternoon in 2016, when I was working in India, I received a telephone message from a recluse who lived in a forest in the middle of Delhi. The message was passed on by our office manager through GChat, and it thrilled me so much that I preserved it.Office manager: Ellen have you been trying to get in touch with the royal family of Oudh?Ellen: this has to be the best telephone message everOffice manager: It was quite strange! The secretary left precise instructions for when you should call her ? tomorrow between 11 am and 12 noonEllen: oh my godI knew about the royal family of Oudh, of course. They were one of the city’s great mysteries. Their story was passed between tea sellers and rickshaw drivers and shopkeepers in Old Delhi: In a forest, they said, in a palace cut off from the city that surrounds it, lived a prince, a princess and a queen, said to be the last of a storied Shia Muslim royal line.There were different versions, depending on whom you spoke to. Some people said the Oudh family had been there since the British had annexed their kingdom, in 1856, and that the forest had grown up around the palace, engulfing it. Some said they were a family of jinns, the supernatural beings of Arabian folklore.An acquaintance who had once glimpsed the princess through a telephoto lens said her hair had not been cut or washed for so many years that it fell to the ground in matted branches. One thing was sure: They didn’t want company. They lived in a 14th-century hunting lodge, which they surrounded with loops of razor wire and ferocious dogs. The perimeter was marked with menacing signs. INTRUDERS SHALL BE GUNDOWN, said one.Macabre storiesEvery few years, the family agreed to admit a journalist, always a foreigner, to tell of their grievances against the state. The journalists emerged with deliciously macabre stories, which I had studied admiringly. In 1997, the prince and the princess told The Times of London that their mother, in a final gesture of protest against the treachery of Britain and India, had killed herself by drinking a poison mixed with crushed diamonds and pearls.I could see why these stories resonated so. The country was imprinted with trauma, by the epic deceit of the British conquest and then the blood bath of the British departure, known as Partition, which carved out Pakistan from India and set off convulsions of Hindu-Muslim violence.This family, displaying its own ruin, was a physical representation of all that India had suffered.A few grainy photographs of the siblings had been published: They were beautiful, pale and high-cheekboned, but also somehow ravaged, harrowed. Nearly every day, dropping my children at school, I drove past the narrow road that led into the middle of the forest, which was surrounded by an ornate wrought-iron fence. The woods were so thick that it was impossible to see much, and inhabited by gangs of monkeys. At night, you could hear jackals howling.The day after I got the message, I dialled the phone number. After a few rings, someone picked up, and I heard a high-pitched, quavering voice on the other end. On the following Monday, I asked our driver to take me into the woods at 5.30 in the afternoon, as instructed.The woods themselves were a bit magical, a thicket in the middle of a city of 20 million. British colonial officers had introduced mesquite trees in the 19th century, and they spread rapidly, swallowing pastures and roads and villages – everything that had been there before. Biologists would later describe it as a “massive invasion” by an “alien species”.We drove farther, until the tree canopy was tormented, thick enough to block out the light.Reader, I should confess that I wanted to write the story. That week, the contents of my inbox were not inspiring: There had been a fire at an ammunition depot. There were budget reports, an unending cycle of state and local elections, the introduction of a goods and services tax.These events, which filled so many of my days at that time, did not entirely satisfy my literary urge. The House of Oudh, now that was a story!Leave the carThe person on the phone had told me to leave the car at the end of the road, beside the high wall of an Indian military compound, and to come alone. This did not surprise me: The Oudh family refused, famously, to meet with Indians. I asked the driver to wait at a distance and stood in the woods, somewhat awkwardly, holding my notebook and wondering what came next.Then the bushes rustled, and a man appeared. He was elfin and wore high-waisted mom jeans. He had high cheekbones with hollows beneath them and wild gray hair that stood up in tufts.“I am Cyrus,” the prince said. It was the high-pitched voice I had heard on the phone.He spoke in bursts, like a person who spent most of his time alone. Then he turned and led me into the woods. I tried to keep up, stepping over a tangle of roots and thorns, and climbed a flight of massive stone stairs leading to the old hunting lodge. It was half-ruined, open to the air, and surrounded by metal gratings one steel bar was loose, and the prince moved it aside with a great clank so that we could enter.I stepped into spare, medieval grandeur, a bare stone antechamber lined with palm trees in brass pots and faded, once-elegant carpets. On the wall hung an oil painting of the prince’s mother swathed in voluminous, dark robes, her eyes closed as if in a trance.The prince led me up to the roof to show me the view. We stopped at the edge of the building, gazing across green treetops to the dusty city, shimmering in the heat. Other great cities may be built on top of ruins, but Delhi is built of them. It is almost impossible to go from one point to another without stumbling over a 700-year-old tomb or a 500-year-old fort.Seven successive Muslim dynasties built their capitals here, each swept aside when its time had passed. The ruins are a reminder that the present dispensation – democracy, Starbucks, Hindu nationalism – is only the blink of an eye in India. We were here, they seem to breathe. This was ours.My idea was to interview the prince and write the story. When I asked about his family, he launched into an animated speech about the perfidy of the British and Indian governments. I recognised quotes from articles I had read, written by colleagues from the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times. He ranted a little, complaining of persecution by a criminal gang. He was flinging his hands wide, declaiming and then dropping to a dramatic whisper, as he spoke of the decline of the house of Oudh.“I am shrinking,” he said. “We are shrinking. The princess is shrinking. We are shrinking.”When I asked if I could publish our interview, he balked. For this, he said, I would need the permission of his sister, Princess Sakina, who was not in Delhi. I would have to come back.It struck me as strange, though. Why summon a journalist if you don’t want to be written about?How it beganThe story began with his mother. She appeared, on the platform of New Delhi’s train station in the early 1970s, seemingly from nowhere, announcing herself as Wilayat, Begum of Oudh.Oudh (pronounced Uh-vud) was a kingdom that no longer existed. The British annexed it in 1856, a trauma from which its capital, Lucknow, never recovered. The core of the city is still made of Oudh’s vaulted shrines and palaces. The begum declared that she would stay in the station until these properties had been restored to her.She settled in the VIP waiting room, and unloaded a whole household there: carpets, potted palms, a silver tea set, Nepali servants in livery, glossy Great Danes. She also had two grown children, Prince Ali Raza and Princess Sakina, a son and a daughter who appeared to be in their 20s. They addressed her as “Your Highness.”The begum was an arresting-looking woman, tall and broad-shouldered, with a face as craggy and immobile as an Easter Island statue. She wore a sari of dark, heavy silk and kept a pistol in its folds. She and her children settled on red plastic chairs, and waited. For years.“Sitting, sitting like yogis,” recalled Father John, a Catholic charity worker who distributed food in the train station. The children were strangely submissive, he said, reluctant even to accept a banana without their mother’s permission.“They were more obedient than the dogs,” he said. “They were absolutely under her control.”The begum’s behaviour was imperious and dramatic. She refused direct conversation, demanding that queries be written on embossed stationery, placed on a silver platter and carried to her by a servant, who read them aloud. If the station master gave her any trouble, she threatened to kill herself by drinking snake venom.“The Nepali servants, they would walk on their knees,” said Saleem Kidwai, a historian who sought them out at the time.Government officials scrambled to find her somewhere to live. She was attracting attention from the media, and officials feared the Shia population in Lucknow could explode into civil unrest if they believed she was being abused.“It was such a romantic image,” Kidwai said. “She is out of the castle, now living in the railway station.”Ammar Rizvi, an aide to the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, was sent to New Delhi as a liaison. He recalled handing Wilayat an envelope with 10,000 rupees – about $90,000 at the time – so that they could set up a household in Lucknow.“In 1975, that was a big sum,” he recalled. “But she got angry and threw the envelope. The notes were flying everywhere, and my public relations officer had to catch this note here, that note there. She said no, she would not go, the amount was very little.”In the months that followed, Rizvi tried to persuade the begum to accept a four-bedroom house in Lucknow, but she refused, saying it was too small. He was getting anxious. Muslims were mobilising once, Rizvi visited during Muharram, an annual ritual of mourning, and found her surrounded by pilgrims, flagellating themselves with chains to which razor blades had been attached.“Poor passengers, they were looking at the whole scene,” he said. “There was blood all over the place.”Making her caseAround this time, Wilayat identified a far more effective way to make her case: foreign correspondents. “India Princess Reigns in Rail Station”, a Times correspondent wrote in 1981, describing her “genuine commitment to redeem the ancestors, to right wrongs suffered over centuries and to obtain justice”.People magazine recorded her declaring, “Let the world know how the descendant of the last nawab of Oudh is treated.”Foreign correspondents arrived, one after another, and readers began to send letters from all corners of the world, expressing outrage on her behalf. The begum imposed stringent conditions – she “could only be photographed when the moon was waning”, United Press International reported – and journalists complied, delighted with the Gothic peculiarity of it all.In 1984, her efforts paid off. Prime minister Indira Gandhi accepted their claim, granting them use of a 14th-century hunting lodge known as Malcha Mahal. They left the train station roughly a decade after they first appeared there. Wilayat never appeared in public again.My responsibilities in New Delhi included a great many diplomatic receptions and buffet dinners, which I found exhausting. It was like being drawn into an imperial court, in which every personal relationship was a series of transactions – exchanges, usually, of bits of status for bits of information. I did not have the clothes for this kind of work, or the personality.So I found it a relief to drive into the forest and sit on Cyrus’s porch, eating pistachios and watching motes of pollen circulate in the sunlight. In a meandering, roundabout way, I was trying to excavate his past. I felt flattered that he allowed me in, again and again, when so many others had been turned away.And yet something also nagged at me about the little family unit, the way they seemed to have scoured away any relationships from before their appearance at the train station.LucknowWhen our conversations had gone on for about nine months, I travelled to Lucknow, a large city in northern India that was the cradle of the Oudh dynasty. I was there to interview detectives for an unrelated story, but I knew that Cyrus had lived there with his mother and sister in the 1970s, so I went to the neighbourhood where I had heard that Oudh descendants lived.There, to my surprise, the old-timers remembered Cyrus and his family. But they told me, almost as an aside, that they had been dismissed as impostors. The Oudh descendants in Kolkata, where the nawab died in exile, had also rejected their claim. And there were questions Cyrus himself seemed unable to answer. Where was he born? Who was his father? How do you crush diamonds, anyway?His sister, Princess Sakina, had not turned up but he gave me a book that she had written, documenting their lives. The book was almost unreadable, haphazardly capitalised, lacking punctuation and written in florid, apocalyptic prose. But sprinkled in the rambling text were flashes of genuine tenderness between the siblings, as if they were two small children, stranded together on a lifeboat.Sakina wrote that she had intended to follow her mother into suicide, but for her brother. The question of his future nagged at her. “ABOUT PRINCE CYRUS RIZA MY BROTHER WHAT STEP SHALL HE FOLLOW?” it says. “MY SILENT SINCEREST SILENCE HAS A WISH THAT PRINCE SHOULD BE BLESSED WITH HAPPINESS.”One night Cyrus called me, howling unintelligibly, to tell me that his sister had in fact died seven months earlier. He had told no one, burying her body himself. He had lied to me about it for months, and seemed a bit ashamed by it. I curled up on my daughter’s bunk bed and listened to his voice over the phone. He said that I should never visit again, and also that he was so lonely.I waited a few days, and then showed up with a Filet O’ Fish from McDonald’s. Our relationship seemed to knit itself back together. He asked me to procure him a gun and a girlfriend, which I did not and a tarpaulin and a recording of Fiddler on the Roof, which I did. He was solicitous and a little corny, with pop culture references that seemed to date from the 1960s.Once, he asked me to kiss him on the cheek – his skin felt fragile, like tissue paper – and he told me that it was the first time he had been kissed in 10 years. “When you are over here, my heart goes doopity doo, Sophia Loren,” he said.He even said I could write something about him, as long as I didn’t go into much detail. “I have to tell the truth,” I told him. “Okay, you have to tell the truth,” he said. “Then again, there is a hole in the bucket, Harry Belafonte.”Final conversationsWe had been debating this for 15 months, and I was due to leave India soon and take up a new assignment in London. This sort of exchange made up the balance of our final conversations: I was trying to get him to reveal something about his origins – anything, really – and he was twisting away from me.“You are just a very mysterious person, because I don’t know who you are,” I said once. His response was coy. “Oh, really,” he said, in a singsong voice. “Well, anyway. Oh, really? If you have said me mysterious, I am just sitting before you.”In our last conversation, a few hours before I boarded a flight for London, he asked me how someone could get word to me, should he die. I asked if he planned to take his own life.“So far, I am going to preserve myself,” he said. “Good. Well, then, I’ll see you again,” I said.I think I hugged him goodbye. The last I saw of him, he was replacing the clanking iron bars that protected him from intruders.Three months later, I was in an airport, on my way home from interviewing the Swedish foreign minister, when I learned Cyrus had died. I got the news on Facebook messenger, from a friend at the BBC.I put down my bag and sat on the airport floor, feeling a little in shock. This feeling was partly selfish. I had a thick file of interviews in a manila envelope labelled “Prince Cyrus”.I had figured that, in this family’s story, there was a parable about India, something about trauma that went unresolved as one empire replaced another.And then there was a second feeling. I was sad that I was not there to help him. I had enjoyed our conversations, the maddening dance of 18 months. I could not believe that he had died alone in that forsaken place. I was sure that in the dark, he had wanted someone to hold his hand. Thinking about this made it difficult to breathe. I stayed there for a moment, in the corridor at the airport, while people hurried past, rolling suitcases behind them.It was the guards at the military facility next door – they called him “rajah”, or king – who later recounted how he had died. Three weeks after we said goodbye, Cyrus was seen trying to wheel his bicycle down the road, shaking violently. An electrician from the military facility helped him to his feet, and he staggered back to the hunting lodge. He asked for a bottle of lemonade and an ice cream.Rajinder Kumar, one of the guards, said it seemed to be dengue fever. I’ve had dengue. It’s like being wiped off the face of the Earth. For me, it began with a penetrating ache in my shoulder, and then, as I sweated through the hotel sheets, hallucinations. My senses were altered. When I drank water from the tap, it tasted like a mouthful of tin.I don’t know what Cyrus hallucinated. His illness may have progressed into haemorrhagic fever, with bleeding from the gums and nose, and under the skin. Patients dying of haemorrhagic fever sometimes have such low blood pressure that no pulse can be detected. Rajinder said Cyrus had refused to be taken to the hospital.“Madam, I really tried very hard,” he said. “I said we would call the police, we would take you to the hospital, but no, no, no. We are outsiders, third-party people, we can’t apply that kind of pressure. Had we been family we could have just taken his hand and taken him.”Rajinder thought it came down to pride. “He used to have the attitude that he was the king,” he said. “That is why he did not want to go to the hospital, that he did not want to be a normal person.”His illness lasted eight days. A boy, sent up to check on his welfare, saw him stalking the property half-clothed, naked from the waist down, or shivering under a mosquito net. Then, after a day or so, no one saw him, and the boy found him dead, curled on the rock floor.Back to Malcha MahalI climbed the stone stairs to Malcha Mahal several months later with a kind of curiosity that was in some ways like greed. I had returned to India for a few days, to see what I could find among his possessions.It is legitimate to ask why I was doing all this. I asked it myself. “Is Cyrus a white whale?” was the subject line of an email I sent my editor. I had become curious – Okay, obsessively curious – about how a family with wealth and status had become lost in the forest. About who they were. Stories like that had always flipped a switch in me, spilling outside the boundaries of the assignment. Something similar had happened to me once, years before, when I pieced together the life story of a woman who had stabbed her children in a basement.When I felt I was making progress it was a calming feeling, as if a cloud of buzzing, disparate information were being forced through a funnel, into a clear stream. Small breakthroughs would drive me forward, like a gambler. On such assignments it was possible to forget unpaid bills, unanswered telephone calls, to set aside anything not required to follow the trail.Cyrus and his family had lived through a great historical rupture: the country’s ision. My sense was that the answer lay there, in an act of government that disrupted the lives of half a continent. But what made me think I could track them down after all these years? Say I did – what could be more interesting than the story they told about themselves?This is what was going through my head as I climbed those stairs. Cyrus’s death had received lots of media coverage, inside India and abroad, and thrill-seekers had tramped through Malcha Mahal, taking video with their phones, hoping to see a ghost. The floor of the entry hall was a havoc of discarded papers that had been dumped from the wardrobe and chest of drawers.I leafed through the letters, looking for a birth certificate, a passport, something that anchored this family in the factual world. What I found instead was a chronicle of 30 years of interactions with journalists. This, it seemed, was the family business. There were dozens of requests from reporters. I have written enough letters of this kind in my life to recognise their pleading tone. Some were written in elaborate, courtly language. Others offered money.Sitting there on the carpet, I laughed out loud. Cyrus and his family would string them along – as he had strung me along – and then, when the mood struck them, disdainfully refuse the interview. The Oudhs were the ones with the story. They had the upper hand.Among the family papers was a column from The Statesman, published in 1993, with the headline “When History Is Based on Errors”. Two paragraphs had been marked.“Have you noticed that a factual error appearing in respected printed form tends to be copied by other researchers in the same field, until, inevitably, it competes with the truth for credibility?” it read. “The writers who perpetuate these mistakes rarely do so from evil motive: They have no axe to grind, they simply do not have time to check and double-check each fact, so they rely on the scholarship of their predecessors.”Two things genuinely surprised me. The first was a stack of receipts for regular, small transfers of cash through Western Union from a city in the industrial north of England. The sender identified himself as a “half brother”.A letterThe other thing was a letter. It was handwritten on fragile, blue airmail stationery and sent in 2006. It was cranky yet intimate, conveying both annoyance and concern, a letter that could only have been written by a relative.“I am in so much pain that I cannot go to the toilet even,” the writer began, and, after an extensive catalogue of physical ailments, went on to complain about the burden of providing continuous financial support for Wilayat and her children. He was obviously not a rich man.“For God’s sake, try to sort yourselves out financially, in case anything goes wrong with me,” the writer told them, appending information for the latest Western Union transfer. “May God help us all.” The letter was signed “Shahid”, and it was sent from an address in Bradford, Yorkshire.Let us pause, for a moment, to consider the tragedy of the house of Oudh. In the mid-19th century, the British East India Co had accelerated its consumption of Indian kingdoms. Having guzzled Punjab and Sindh, it set its ambitions on Oudh, a territory roughly the size of South Carolina.Oudh was ruled at the time by a nawab, or provincial governor, named Wajid Ali Shah, a dreamy aesthete who spent his time orchestrating lavish entertainments in a harem that he called the Parikhana, or “abode of fairies”. He thought the British were his allies, because his great-uncle had extended them vast loans.The British thought otherwise. They stripped the nawab of his kingdom on the grounds of mismanagement, thrusting into his hands a treaty declaring that “the territories of Oude shall be henceforth vested for ever, in the Honorable East India Company”.The nawab wept, solemnly removed his turban and placed it in the envoy’s hands. Soon thereafter, he set off for exile in Calcutta, and Lucknow was cast into mourning, the historian Rosie Llewellyn-Jones recalls in her biography of Wajid Ali Shah.“The body of the town was left soulless,” Zahuruddin Bilgrami wrote at that time. “Grief rained down from every door and wall. There was no lane, bazaar, or dwelling which did not wail in our full agony of separation.”The nawab’s mother, in seclusion, sailed to Britain in a desperate attempt to plead her case with Queen Victoria, something the wags at Punch magazine found hilarious:The Queen of Oude Is disendowed Of regions rich and juicy Their milk and honey I mean their money Squeezed out by Lord Dalhousie Oudh was finished. The vanished kingdom would hang over Lucknow like a pall.Haunted cityI returned to Lucknow, and took a cab to a warren of residential streets tucked behind the grand shrines and palaces of the old city.This is where I had encountered witnesses who could remember Cyrus and his family. Horses pulled carts through the narrow lanes, and I could hear tinny music playing on a radio. Nostalgia for Oudh was a cottage industry here. Everywhere I went, I saw the image of the last nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, his expression dreamy, one nipple poking out of his shirt.Then there were the descendants. Because Wajid Ali Shah had hundreds of wives and concubines, people identifying themselves as descendants are all over the place in Lucknow, fighting like polecats over the veracity of one another’s claims.When I asked about the family, I encountered instant recognition: Yes, three of them had moved into this complex for a few months in the 1970s. Abrar Hussain, who had worked for Wilayat as a servant, said the family had caused a sensation, especially among Shias. Ordinary people were moved to tears at the sight of them, and some were so awed by the begum – so convinced that she was their returning queen – that they refused to turn their backs to her, walking backward, out of respect.“It wasn’t just me – the whole public was coming to see her, and was going crazy,” he said. “People would cry to see her in this condition.”But the older men who presided over the neighbourhood, mostly descendants of members of the nawab’s court, said the family were impostors. Sayyed Suleiman Naqvi, a former code-breaker for the Indian army, said he had posed as a journalist in order to check Wilayat’s credentials.“She said, ‘We have got documentary evidence.’ I said, ‘Get it.’ She said, ‘I will give it only to those persons who are in authority.’ She showed us certain pieces of crockery and all that, which were of course antiques,” recalled Naqvi, now in his late 70s. “But she did not show us any documents.”The family left Lucknow abruptly, he said. Something had happened: An elderly aunt said she recognised Wilayat from before Partition. The aunt said Wilayat was an ordinary woman then, the young wife of a civil servant. Naqvi, who considers himself a keen student of human nature, said he believed they were frauds, but that they were not motivated by greed.“To my mind, this lady was a megalomaniac,” he said finally. “She should have been psychologically tested.”His assessment of her children, however, was quite different. “They believed their mother,” he said, “because she was their mother.”Everything I had learned in India was fragmentary, neighbourhood gossip unbottled after 40 years.To YorkshireI returned to London with three real leads. The airmail letter from Yorkshire. That name, Shahid. The Western Union receipts, testament that someone had been caring for Cyrus and his family in secret all these years. I took a train to Bradford, and walked to the address on the envelope. It was a gray, windblown day, and the walk took me past pawnshops, cheap Chinese takeout joints and dinky row houses of yellow brick, nearly all of them occupied by immigrants from India and Pakistan.I arrived, finally, at a small, neat brick house that was surrounded by a large collection of ceramic garden gnomes, teddy bears, Yorkies, mermaids and fairies. I was so nervous that I paced in front of the house for a while before ringing the bell. The door swung open, and before me stood a man in tiger-print pyjamas.He was barrel-chested and broad-shouldered, and looked to be in his mid-80s. He did not look well: His eyes were rheumy, his chest sunken. But he had Cyrus’s face, the same jutting cheekbones and hawk nose.He led me inside, showed me to a chair and then lay down on a cot. His movements were laborious. He glanced without expression at the photographs I had brought with me. When I offered to play him a recording of Cyrus’s voice, he shook his head in refusal, saying it would be too painful.Beside his sickbed were two framed pictures of Wilayat. This was Shahid. He was Cyrus’s older brother. And now, finally, there were some facts.They were, or had been, an ordinary family. Their father had been the registrar of Lucknow University, Inayatullah Butt. My friend’s name was not Prince Cyrus, or Prince Ali Raza, or Prince anything. He was plain old Mickey Butt. Here, in this brick house in West Yorkshire, I had found it: The identity that Cyrus and his family had worked so hard to keep secret.Shahid, who spent his adult life working in an iron foundry, could remember a life before Oudh, when they had housemaids and school uniforms. When their mother was not a rebel queen, but a housewife.Before long, Shahid’s wife, Camellia, came home. She was a friendly, plain-spoken Lancashire woman, animated on the subject of the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn (whom she despised), and her husband (whom she adored.) The two of them met in 1968, when she wore her hair in a blond beehive and Shahid was built like a heavyweight boxer in those days, she said, dreamily, he could fight four men at once.She never met her husband’s mother, but had corresponded with her for years. She thought the story about Oudh was, as she put it, “a bloody big act”. “What was wrong with this woman?” she said of Wilayat. “I believed every word of it at the beginning, but now I doubt all of it. It’s very hard to get Shahid to talk about it. I think it’s painful. I think he was led to believe it was true. Then, as he got older, he realised it was all built on sand.”Shahid ran away when he was about 14, then emigrated to Britain and rarely mentioned his mother’s claim to the royal house of Oudh. When I asked him about that story, he was evasive. He said he wasn’t even sure whether he was Indian or Pakistani.“I’m so confused, I don’t know who I am,” he said. “I am like a bird, a long lost bird, a lost lamb.”I kept asking questions but Shahid was preoccupied by the news of Cyrus’s death – he called him Mickey – and that no one knew exactly where he was buried.“I should have saved him,” he said.Now, all of a sudden, the field of witnesses had expanded. There were other relatives, respectable people, scattered across Pakistan, Britain and the United States. Cyrus’s oldest brother, Salahuddin Zahid Butt, was a pilot in the Pakistani air force, a war hero who bombed Indian positions in the 1965 war. He died in 2017, but his wife, Salma, lived in Texas.I called her. She said her mother-in-law’s claim to royal descent was false. “She thought she was the princess of Oudh, but this was never, ever,” she said of Wilayat. “We never heard this history about the princess of this, the princess of that. She obviously had some mental disorder.”LahoreTwo of Cyrus’s older cousins, Wahida and Khalida, were still in Lahore, so I flew to Pakistan to see them. I parked beside an open sewer full of black, seething water, and walked down a trash-choked alleyway and knocked on a wooden door. It opened into a spacious compound, eerily quiet and green, with rosebushes in bloom.The cousins were hunched, birdlike women in their 70s. Wahida had worked for many years as a teacher, and barely spoke. She seemed to communicate by slapping people, hard, across the face. She wandered from one of us to the other, looking for someone to slap. Once, it was me. Mostly it was my interpreter, whose face hardened into a permanent wince. Khalida did most of the talking.She remembered Wilayat as a tempestuous young woman, but said they hadn’t seen her since the late 1960s, when she suddenly left Pakistan and returned to India. They seemed unwilling to say anything further. After listening to them discuss other subjects for an hour, I pressed the issue, conscious of the passage of time.“Ask her, did you ever hear that your family was related to the royal nawabs of Oudh?” I relayed to my interpreter. “I have no idea,” Khalida answered.“Wilayat said she was the queen of Oudh,” I told them. “She told the Indian government that for many, many years.”I prodded them for hours, until I was tired and frustrated.“Wilayat is dead,” I said. “Her children are dead. There is no secret anymore.”“Everything is a lie,” Khalida said. “They are dead. Just leave them. God forgives them, so we should also forgive them.”Trying to get Shahid to speak about his mother and siblings was painful. He would get stuck at a particular moment in the story, when his mother sent him out to buy bananas and he fled the family. Camellia said that, to this day, he would not eat bananas. She thought it was guilt. Besides, he was becoming sicker and sicker.It wasn’t a chest infection, but lung cancer that had metastasised to his lymph nodes. Camellia would not think of allowing him to be admitted to the hospital, but nursed him in the front room until there was nothing to do but give him painkillers.On my fourth visit to Bradford, the last time I saw him, his voice was raspy, but he told me more than he ever had before. The story, as he told it, began at Partition.On June 3rd, 1947, the British viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, announced that the withdrawal of British Empire would create two independent nations, with Pakistan carved out for Muslims. Lucknow’s educated Muslims began slipping away overnight, headed for Pakistan’s new capital, where they would make up the DNA of a new elite. There were letters promising juicy promotions. And there were, on the other hand, rumours of violence if they stayed.Shahid’s parents had to make an immediate decision between India or Pakistan. His mother, Wilayat Butt, had never been so happy as she was in Lucknow. She was fiery and strong. Shahid has an image of her, striding out onto her balcony in Lucknow in jodhpurs and riding boots, slapping her thigh with a crop. She simply refused to leave.But then came one afternoon in the crumbling elegance of the nawab’s city. Shahid’s father – a man in distinguished middle age, wearing wire-rimmed glasses – was riding his bicycle home when he was surrounded by Hindu youths, who began beating him with hockey sticks.Bathed in bloodHe soon decided to move the whole family to Pakistan, where, in the great reshuffling, he had been offered a job overseeing the new country’s civil aviation agency. He was right to worry over the months that followed, the city of his youth, Lahore, would be bathed in blood.“We were children,” recalled Salma, Wilayat’s daughter-in-law. “Riots were on, and we couldn’t go out at all. Weeks and weeks, the dead bodies were lying around, and when we went to the bazaar to get our food there was so much rioting and robbing, people were robbing. At night it would be very frightening, you could hear people crying and shooting and stabbing. We would be sitting next to the window and watching.”Wilayat followed her husband, Shahid told me, but she never accepted his decision to leave India. She was obsessed with what she had left behind. In her mind, the grudge sprouted and germinated, and her behaviour became volatile. Then her husband suddenly died. Now with all restraining influence on her gone, furious over the expropriation of her property, she accosted Pakistan’s prime minister at a public appearance, Shahid said, and slapped him.This changed things for Wilayat. She was no longer a well-connected widow, but something shadier. She was confined to a mental hospital in Lahore for six months after that – the only way, Shahid said, to avoid a long prison sentence. Shahid remembers visiting her there, among the wails and curses of the patients.“It was horrible,” he said. “Women tied up with chains. One poor girl was chained up to a wall. It was four chains. And she was swinging. And spitting at everybody who went past.”Salma said that Wilayat was given electroshock therapy. “They said she was mental,” she said. “They gave her all these injections.”When she was free, Wilayat gathered up her youngest children without warning, packed trunks with carpets and jewellery, and smuggled it all back into India, with the goal of reclaiming her property. Shahid set out with them but eventually walked away. He could not put into words why he left. His story flickers out here.Early this month, Shahid died in the front room of his house, holding Camellia’s hand. It was Partition that ruined his mother, set her on the course toward the ruined palace, Shahid had told me.“We had to start all over again,” he said.In the early 1970s, still empty-handed, increasingly bizarre in her behaviour, Wilayat announced to the world that she was the queen of Oudh, demanding the vast properties of a kingdom that no longer existed. An ordinary grievance, unaddressed, had metastasised to become an epic one.They took on new identities: Farhad became Princess Sakina, occasionally Princess Alexandrina Mickey became Prince Ali Raza, and later called himself Prince Cyrus. They no longer made any mention of their Pakistani relatives, or the spacious family house in Lahore that was waiting for them should they return. Maybe they forgot it existed. They seemed to shed their past entirely, to come from nowhere.The rest of the story you already know. They were so convincing, and so insistent, that for 40 years people believed them. So there it is: I have plundered their secret.Cyrus would have hated it. He refused to answer questions about his past it was one of the essential themes of our friendship. I try to imagine how he would react to all this. His father on his bicycle, being beaten with hockey sticks. His mother in a mental hospital where women were chained to the wall. His older brother running away, abandoning him. Mickey Butt, the name he had left behind.There is no nice way to put this. I am unravelling the story that was the central work of their lives. It is impossible to know, now that he and his sister are dead, whether they even knew it wasn’t all true. Either way, this article would have crushed him. And yet, why do you invite a journalist into your life, if you do not expect this to happen? That is like asking a dog not to bark.I must admit, it offends me a little when people think they can lie to reporters. But even today there are plenty of autorickshaw drivers in Old Delhi who will tell you about the prince who lived in the jungle. And they will be telling that story long after mine has come and gone.I was reminded of this on my last trip to Delhi. I visited the cemetery where Cyrus is buried. I had an idea of placing a stone there, something that said Prince Cyrus of Oudh. But he had been buried as an unclaimed body, assigned the number DD33B. Unclaimed bodies are marked only with chips of stone, and small mounds extend in all directions, to the vanishing point. After wandering the cemetery for what seemed like hours, I sat down, sweaty and miserable.“He is lost in a city of the dead,” I wrote in my notebook.The strangerMy colleague Suhasini was haranguing the clerk, urging him to look through his ledger one more time, when I realised that a man was warming himself beside a stove, listening intently. He then stood up and presented himself, rather formally.He was Mohammad Aslam Chowdhury, a seller of electrical wiring from Old Delhi. He was wearing a voluminous, cheap-looking tweed jacket, and had a squiff of hair, dyed jet black. He presented a plastic folder and showed me its contents. It was filled with newspaper clippings about Cyrus’s death.He said he carried the clippings to remind himself how swiftly earthly glory passes. “In Old Delhi, this was the only topic of conversation,” he said. “People were saying such a big king passed away like this, in such a way that nobody knew him. How could the scion of such an illustrious royal family get lost in the darkness of oblivion?”As he spoke of Cyrus’s death, Chowdhury became distressed. “I feel really emotional about this, that something like this can happen on an Earth made by God,” he cried out, as the other people in the clerk’s office turned to stare. “O destiny, tell me why you are angry with me. What I have done wrong?”I glanced incredulously at my interpreter: Could this really be happening? But Chowdhury was in his own world. The story of the royals of Oudh had sounded a note within him. He would be telling the story for years, I realised.“If a person like this has gone into oblivion, and had this death of anonymity,” he said, wonderingly, “what can you say about the death of a commoner?” – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or

merritt first line defence against usman khans london bridge","story":"Lukasz Koczocik will receive an honour for bravery in his native PolandWhen Usman Khan emerged into the hallway armed and ready to begin his rampage of terror it was his mentor Jack Merritt who was the first to rush to stop him.Friends and colleagues have said that he had found an affinity with the convicted terrorists, and was convinced that he could “guide him to redemption”.But that faith was repaid with violence as Khan slashed out at those who tried to prevent his murderous spree.A detailed account of the first moments of Friday’s London Bridge attack has emerged for the first time along with stories of the incredible acts of heroism of members of the public.Khan had been given special permission by the authorities to travel to the capital unsupervised and had in the morning given a “convincing” talk about his rehabilitation during a workshop at Learning Together’s fifth anniversary event.Mr Koczocik armed himself with a long stick and confronted Usman KhanBut the convicted terrorist, who had only been released from prison 11 months earlier, used a break in the afternoon’s proceedings to go into the toilets and tape a fake suicide vest to his body and knives to his hands.At around 1.55pm he emerged into the hallway on the first floor of the Fishmongers Hall and began his attack.Mr Merritt, 25, who had helped to organise the event, ran out to try and calm him down along with others who had been in the Banqueting Hall of the Grade I listed building, sources told the .Bryonn Bain, an associate professor with the University of California in Los Angeles who spoke at the conference, said that the “brave” Cambridge graduate “was the first line of defence, he was the first person to confront him”.Lukasz Koczocik, a worker at the venue had been cleaning glasses in the basement and heard the screams, also ran to help.“He goes towards the trouble, he gets there on the first floor and it is very clear that there’s a bad guy, he’s got two knives in his hand, there’s screaming, there’s chaos,” Toby Williamson, chief executive of the Fishmongers Company, told the BBC as he paid tribute to his staff.Usman Khan’s route of terrorMr Koczocik armed himself with a long stick and “charges towards the bad guy” but hits “something protective”.But he’s buying time and he allows others to escape to move to adjacent rooms and at that point he has about a one minute one on one straight combat,” Mr Williamson said.“This guy Khan then works his way up Lukasz pole slashing with his knife, he takes five wounds to his left side.”Mr Bain said that it “felt like a warzone... it felt like total chaos.Mr Koczocik, who it was announced on Monday will be getting an honour for bravery in his native Poland, started to lose strength but two men from the conference rushed to intervene.One was armed with a fire extinguisher and the other with a narwhal tusk that he had ripped from the wall.“They come and join the fight and it is pretty gruesome and I think the terrorist decided he was outnumbered, he runs though and goes down the main staircase and the next bit of hell is he is at reception and he can\u0027t get out the front door,  Mr Williamson said.Gareth, the doorman is pushing the door shut as good as he can whilst another worker named only as Dawn calls the police.People were trying to keep the door closed and Khan was swinging knives at them, it was said.Saskia Jones, a 23-year-old who had volunteered with Learning Together, a Cambridge University rehabilitation initiative, was also fatally wounded inside the building and at least two others were seriously injured.Finding himself trapped Khan turned to the girls in the cloakroom, Alla and Sandra, and gives them a “hell of a time” before a showdown in the entrance hall with Mr Koczocik “leading the charge”.Mr Williamson said: “Andy the last guy introduced here, our maintenance man, he’s a Ministry of Defence ex-policeman and he’s also a pretty cool customer.“But when the knife goes to his chest and kill or open the door is the choice he pauses for a moment, he’s reluctant to spill all this out onto the pavement when members of public are going to be facing the same problems but he makes exactly the right choice, the door’s opened, out the terrorist falls and the first one after him is Lukasz shouting at everyone to get out of the way, to get back.But members of the public just don’t do that nowadays, they do what they needed to do, they join in and the man with the fire extinguisher, the man with the narwhal tusk, they are all in there.”Footage has emerged of the two men linked to the charity spraying and prodding Khan with the Narwhal tusk before he is tackled to the floor.Some of the have-a-go-heroes were former convicts who were attending the event, it was said. Moments later, at 2.02pm police marksmen arrive and after pulling the final member of the public away from Khan he is shot dead.But in his wake he left a trail of devastation, with Mr Bain recognising: “I saw people die. I saw things that I will never be able to unsee.Those who will feel that devastation most keenly are the family and friends of Miss Jones and Mr Merritt, who had dedicated their lives to helping others.Victims: Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23David Merritt wrote that his son was “was selfless in his dedication to make things right in every second of his life”.“Jack devoted his energy to the purpose of Learning Together: a pioneering programme to bring students from university and prisons together to share their unique perspectives on justice,” he said.“Unlike many of us, Jack did not just go to work. He lived and breathed fire in his pursuit of a better world for all humanity, particularly those most in need.”It emerged that Khan had shown “an affinity” towards Jack Merritt, the Learning Together course co-ordinator who helped mentor and supervise him.One source at Cambridge said: “We’ve heard that Khan was initially very sceptical about the group that wanted to help him rebuild his life but built up a mutual understanding and respect towards Jack. It wasn’t so much a friendship, but there seems to have been a special bond, a closeness.“Jack was convinced he could guide Khan to redemption, I think he really believed that he could turn his life round. “He even became a case study for the group.“That’s why it’s so galling that Jack was murdered in cold blood by the man who appeared to have bonded with him. “Second person found alive after two weeks in outback after drinking from cattle water holeIsil finds new online home after Telegram messaging service purgeFirst woman to appeal murder conviction in wake of Sally Challan was suffering PTSD, court hears Nato summit: Donald Trump says \u0026#39we would be in World War Three if it wasn\u0026#39t for me\u0026#39General election 2019: Donald Trump insists he wants \u0026#39nothing to do\u0026#39 with NHS - latest newsNew Zealand bans foreign political donations after warnings of overseas interferenceComment: Even by Donald Trump’s incredible standards, this press conference was truly bizarrePictured: Schoolboy victim of Essex \u0026#39deliberate\u0026#39 hit-and-run named after driver, 51, arrested on suspicion of murder  Comment: Donald Trump\u0026#39s visit to Britain could turn out to be a humiliation... for Jeremy CorbynComment: Politicians don\u0026#39t understand the true nature of the terror threatComment: Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s NHS conspiracy theory will thrive no matter what Donald Trump says Indian engineer \u0026#39interested in space\u0026#39 helps Nasa locate debris of Delhi\u0026#39s crashed Moon rover\u0026#39Exhilirating, bewildering\u0026#39: in the room with President TrumpSoldier wins racism claim against British Army after superiors confused him with only other black sergeant in unitBritish teenager describes in Cyprus court how she was gang raped - an assault police claim she inventedComment: Is Putin Corbyn\u0026#39s puppet master, or is the Labour leader just a useful idiot? Putin signs bill targeting journalists and bloggers as foreign agentsUS city to pay reparations to African-American community with tax on marijuana sales A guide to postal votes and proxy votes for the 2019 general electionHow to vote in the 2019 general election When is the general election 2019 and when will we know the results? We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain jumps international maths rankings following chinese","story":"The UK came 18th, up from 27th three years ago, in the Pisa league tableDepartment for EducationProgramme for International Student Assessment (PISA)Britain has jumped up international rankings for maths following Government efforts to import Chinese-style teaching into the classroom.The UK came 18th, up from 27th three years ago, in the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) league table.The Pisa tests, which are administered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, were taken by 79 countries last year.The assessment is carried out every three years and involves more than half a million 15-year-olds across the globe taking two-hour tests.Last year the UK scored an average of 502 points in mathematics, up from 492 in 2015.Within the UK, the average score for maths among English pupils (504) was “significantly higher” than scores for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the Department for Education said.Experts have said that ministers’ attempts to emulate Chinese teaching methods are likely to have driven up the UK’s test results.  Countries in the Far East - including China, Singapore and Hong Kong – have long come at the top of the league tables for maths.Prof Valsa Koshy, an expert in maths education at Brunel University, said: “Importing maths teaching from Far Eastern countries means there has been an emphasis on children needing to master the basic facts and traditional skills such as times tables. This used to be laughed at as too old fashioned.”In 2014, the DfE set up an exchange programme between English and Shanghai schools, so that maths teachers could learn about Chinese teaching methods.The programme was followed two years later by a £41 million pound project to train thousands of primary schools to adopt the “Shanghai-style”, also known as the “maths mastery approach”.Maths mastery involves children being taught as a whole class, building depth of understanding of the structure of the subject, and is supported by the use of high-quality textbooks. A series of maths “hubs” were set up around the country to train teachers in the new methods.Ben Durbin, head of international at the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) which administered the Pisa tests in the UK, said it was “encouraging” to see that the boost in score for maths was driven by improvements among boys and lower achieving students.The UK also ranked higher for reading and science than it did three years ago, coming 14th place in the international rankings for both in the most recent Pisa test up from 22nd and 15th respectively. As well as coming below countries in the Far East, the UK also ranked below other European countries such as Estonia, Slovenia and Poland for all three subjects.Teenagers who took the test were also asked about a range of other issues such as their wellbeing and happiness.According to the rankings, 53 per cent of British students said they felt satisfied with their lives, which is well below the OECD average of 67 per cent.School leaders welcomed the improvements in maths but voiced concern about the results for children’s wellbeing.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is clear that many young people feel under great pressure in a society in which the stakes often seem very high to them in terms of achieving their goals.“We must do more to understand the complex factors which affect wellbeing and ensure schools and colleges are sufficiently funded to be able to provide appropriate pastoral support.”Department for EducationProgramme for International Student Assessment (PISA)The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Until now, a device dying\u0026nbsphas meant being unable to tap out and potentially running into a fine, but it will now continue to work for five hours after the battery runs out of charge.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut both features are limited to more recent phones. Tapping out without battery requires an iPhone XS or later, and an Apple Watch Series 4 or later Express Transit needs an iPhone 6s or newer.Before the Express Transit mode arrived, iPhone users had to double press a button on their phone and then authenticate the payment with their finger or face. That led to queues at Tube stations as travellers got their devices ready to pay.Now it will work in the same way as a contactless bank card, needing only to be tapped on the reader, as long as the new mode is switched on.​A notification is being sent out to users in the London area making them aware of the feature.The move comes as one in five contactless journeys across TfL are now made using a smart device.It is a step change in the way we think about how to charge people, the notion of having to understand what ticket you need, do I need an Oyster Card, explained Mike Tuckett, head of transformation delivery for TfL.We\u0027re just trying to sweep that away and make it super simple.Other transactions using Apple Pay will still need to be authenticated in the usual way, using Face ID or Touch ID before making a purchase.It\u0027s the first time Express Transit has been enabled in the UK, after countries including China and Japan, as well as a trial in New York.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He has £9.4bn, according to Forbes.Hedge fund manager Michael Platt has £6.1bn and Conservative party donors, Simon and David Reuben, have accumulated an estimated £5.8bn each.

Based on data\u0026nbspin Credit Suisse\u0027s World Wealth Report,\u0026nbspThe Equality Trust calculates that the richest 1 per cent in the UK owns the same wealth that the bottom 80 per cent, or 53.2 million people.Such comparisons have sometimes been criticised in the past because they include some people with debts as having zero negative wealth, when they may actually be living relatively comfortably. What is not disputed is that wealth has risen sharply over the past decade as those with assets such as shares and investment property have enjoyed rising prices. Over the same period, rewards for work have not kept up. Average inflation-adjusted wages have still not recovered to their pre-crisis peak in 2007 the longest wage stagnation in two centuries.Welfare cuts and tax changes since the Conservative-led coalition came to power in 2010 have hurt the poorest the most.By far the worst-affected have been the poorest 10 per cent of households with children who have seen their incomes cut by almost a fifth - £3,800 per year, research published last week by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows. Overall, households in the lowest tenth - with or without\u0026nbsp have seen their budgets cut by 7 per cent.\u0026nbspThe highest-income decile also pay 4 per cent more of their income as tax, the IFS found. However, that group, which has more savings, investments and property, is also most likely to have benefited from rising wealth.Inequality has become an important issue in the election, with the Labour Party pointing out that a third of the UK\u0027s billionaires have donated to the Conservatives.The Resolution Foundation warned last week that child poverty will rise to the highest since the aftermath of the Second World War under the Conservatives, because the party\u0027s manifesto retains existing benefit cuts.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Anything below 50 means the sector is contracting. However, market watchers might take some relief from the fact that it beat preliminary figures of 48.3, released for the first time ever two weeks ago.Created with Sketch.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe sector was hit as companies continued to eat up the stockpiles they had built up in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit.Companies had worried they might not be able to get some supplies from Europe if Britain crashed out without a deal. However, now that the Brexit date has been postponed, businesses are using up these supplies, and not buying new products.This meant that new orders fell for the seventh month in a row, a fact that was exacerbated by global trade worries. The drop in new export orders was one of the steepest in the past seven years.“A heavy sense of inevitability hung around the sector in November as it continued to suffer the effects of a lethal cocktail of Brexit uncertainty, slowing global growth and an impending general election,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply.He added: “Inevitably, where new orders fall, jobs are sure to follow and manufacturing employment fell at its fastest pace since September 2012.“Firms tried to balance their books by reducing overheads and improving efficiencies quickly, and staff numbers were the casualties.”Several businesses decided to shut their doors in November, with Mothercare among the highest-profile casualties.Last week Bonmarche announced it was avoiding collapse after being taken out of administration by Peacocks. But around 240 jobs will still be lost as 30 stores are closed before Christmas.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes.

Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income.

Families across the country are working for their poverty and unable to promise their children a better, secure future.\u0026nbsp“The UK’s economy delivers billions for a few and poverty for millions. Destitution is the sad reality for millions this Christmas.Average wealth per person in the UK has risen every year since 2008 and is now 41 per cent above its 2007 level, but the spoils have not been ided evenly.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailTory plans will see child poverty rise to record high, report findsCredit Suisse found that the number of dollar millionaires in the UK has jumped from 750,000 in 2010 to 2.5 million this year, a number that is expected to jump by almost 30 per cent over the next five years. Based on data\u0026nbspin Credit Suisse\u0027s World Wealth Report,\u0026nbspThe Equality Trust calculates that the richest 1 per cent in the UK owns the same wealth that the bottom 80 per cent, or 53.2 million people.Such comparisons have sometimes been criticised in the past because they include some people with debts as having zero negative wealth, when they may actually be living relatively comfortably. What is not disputed is that wealth has risen sharply over the past decade as those with assets such as shares and investment property have enjoyed rising prices. Over the same period, rewards for work have not kept up. Average inflation-adjusted wages have still not recovered to their pre-crisis peak in 2007 the longest wage stagnation in two centuries.Welfare cuts and tax changes since the Conservative-led coalition came to power in 2010 have hurt the poorest the most.By far the worst-affected have been the poorest 10 per cent of households with children who have seen their incomes cut by almost a fifth - £3,800 per year, research published last week by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows. Overall, households in the lowest tenth - with or without\u0026nbsp have seen their budgets cut by 7 per cent.\u0026nbspThe highest-income decile also pay 4 per cent more of their income as tax, the IFS found. However, that group, which has more savings, investments and property, is also most likely to have benefited from rising wealth.Inequality has become an important issue in the election, with the Labour Party pointing out that a third of the UK\u0027s billionaires have donated to the Conservatives.The Resolution Foundation warned last week that child poverty will rise to the highest since the aftermath of the Second World War under the Conservatives, because the party\u0027s manifesto retains existing benefit cuts.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There was no waiting in the lines obviously – you were with a prince,” she told Panorama.\u0026nbsp“Andrew asked me what I wanted to drink, you know, and I said, ‘Oh, you know, something from the bar’. He had something clear. I know mine was vodka … and then he asked me to dance.“He is the most hideous dancer I’ve ever seen in my life.“I mean it was horrible and this guy was sweating all over me, like his sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere. I was just like ‘ugh’ – grossed out from it, but I knew I had to keep him happy because that’s what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would have expected from me.”When they left the club, Ms Giuffre says Ms Maxwell gave her instructions.“In the car Ghislaine tells me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey, and that just made me sick.”\u0026nbspShe said that later that evening, she had sex with the duke upstairs at Ms Maxwell’s house in Belgravia.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I mean come on.“I’m calling BS on this. He knows what happened, I know what happened.

This is a story of being trafficked, this is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guys’ royalty.”The Panorama interview was recorded before the Prince spoke to Newsnight but she has since told the BBC she stands by every word she said.In response to the programme, Buckingham Palace referred to a previous statement saying: “It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.”A statement last month said the duke “unequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein” and “deeply sympathises with those affected who want some form of closure”.The Prince and the Epstein Scandal\u0026nbspis on BBC One at 9pm.Duke of York\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Anything below 50 means the sector is contracting. However, market watchers might take some relief from the fact that it beat preliminary figures of 48.3, released for the first time ever two weeks ago.Created with Sketch.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe sector was hit as companies continued to eat up the stockpiles they had built up in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit.Companies had worried they might not be able to get some supplies from Europe if Britain crashed out without a deal. However, now that the Brexit date has been postponed, businesses are using up these supplies, and not buying new products.This meant that new orders fell for the seventh month in a row, a fact that was exacerbated by global trade worries. The drop in new export orders was one of the steepest in the past seven years.“A heavy sense of inevitability hung around the sector in November as it continued to suffer the effects of a lethal cocktail of Brexit uncertainty, slowing global growth and an impending general election,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply.He added: “Inevitably, where new orders fall, jobs are sure to follow and manufacturing employment fell at its fastest pace since September 2012.“Firms tried to balance their books by reducing overheads and improving efficiencies quickly, and staff numbers were the casualties.”Several businesses decided to shut their doors in November, with Mothercare among the highest-profile casualties.Last week Bonmarche announced it was avoiding collapse after being taken out of administration by Peacocks. But around 240 jobs will still be lost as 30 stores are closed before Christmas.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were WRONG. All those Labour toffs thought they could live without all of us thick, ignorant peasants who dared to disobey the establishment and vote for Brexit.Emily Thornberry — Lady Nugee, who chuckled at seeing the flag of  St George! — was wrong. Sir Keir Starmer, so passionate in his adoration of Brussels, was wrong.Corbyn — a man without a patriotic bone in his withered old carcass — was wrong. Labour’s total contempt for the working class, who they were founded to represent, has them stumbling towards defeat.So Labour are rethinking their General Election strategy.In Leave-voting areas, Labour will get down on their knees and beg the working class to come home.Even an unequivocal Remainer like Ed Miliband is pretending he has always fought for a Brexit deal.No, Ed — you fought to keep us in a single market and a customs union. You fought for a Brexit that was unworthy of the name.You fought for a deal that was worse than staying in the EU.Labour should really stop fibbing to the British people.The modern Labour Party has no love, affection or understanding of the working class. It is the Tories who now represent the values of  the working man and woman — their patriotism, their belief in democracy, their belief in family  and hard work.In working-class communities, Labour are ludicrously flexing their non-existent Leave credentials — which is both bitterly ironic and horribly hypocritical.Ask all the decent Labour MPs who have suffered torrents of abuse from Labour’s online thugs for ­daring to suggest that the Referendum result, and democracy itself, should be respected.Labour are the Remain party who are too pathetically gutless to admit it. But this election is not simply about Brexit.Infinitely more important than our relationship with the European Union is stopping an economically moronic, terrorist sympathiser like Corbyn from getting anywhere near  Downing Street.I have only ever been a member of one political party — Labour.It was the party of my family, my neighbourhood and my class.That party no longer exists.Corbyn and his Marxist muppets have ruined Labour with their sickening Jew-baiting racism, their puerile class war, their total lack of understanding of even basic ­economics.Do not let them ruin the country.Do not believe the lies that they are going to tell you over the next  days.Andyou are working class, never believe for a single second that this pathetic excuse for a ­Labour Party is on your side.Labour have thrown in their lot with privately educated revolutionaries who would rather wave a Palestinian flag than the Union Jack.And it is only now they are starting to regret it.TOSSING back her golden tresses, Charlize Theron wears a gold dress against a golden background in an ad for Dior’s J’Adore perfume – which comes in a golden bottle.It is like being buried in an avalanche of Ferrero Rocher chocolates.And that’s a compliment.And because he wasn’t there, he must also have invented the scene where a young Prince Charles sobs because he has been forced to break up with a hot young Camilla.And far more offensively, Morgan is surely making it all up when he depicts the Queen faking a tear as she witnesses the horror of  Aberfan.All the real-le photos of the Queen visiting the tragic Welsh mining village show her looking shocked  beyond belief.I do not believe she faked a tear for the cameras.I enjoy The Crown but it is only a posh EastEnders.Don’t mistake it for anything resembling  historical truth.WHAT happened to Katie Price’s £million fortune Just guessing here – she spent it.I will leave it to others to analyse Katie’s profligacy with money and just say this in her defence.She has been a loving mother to her children, including her blind, autistic son Harvey, now , who she seems to have raised single-handedly.She is an inspiration to any parents raising a disabled child.  She has confronted the evil bullies who have mocked her son.She has been a passionate campaigner to hold social media s to account and make online abuse a criminal offence.I don’t think there is anyone in the country who has been more willing to stand up to bullies than Katie.And now she is bankrupt, owing £, to her creditors.I suspect she has faced bigger battles than bankruptcy.THE Liberal Democrats thought vowing to immediately cancel Brexit when Jo Swinson becomes Prime Minister would be a vote winner.Whoops! Now the Lib Dems are desperately offering a second Referendum.Whoops again!Because millions of us hope we never see another referendum in our letime.Paul has had more barmaids than the Rovers Return.VICTORIA Beckham’s  fashion empire has lost a jaw-dropping £million over  years.So who is doing Victoria’s financial planning Diane Abbott CLIVE James, who has died at the age of , was always the smartest man in the room.I met him a few times over the years but the Australian journalist, broadcaster and wit was best experienced on the page and on TV. That is when you got the full force of his brain, which was the size of a planet.Clive was also that great rarity – a true intellectual who was a laugh.As a TV critic, he brought his savage wit to bear on the nuttiest nooks and crannies of global television. As a writer, he was funny, wise and often deeply moving.When Princess Diana died, Clive wrote an unforgettable eulogy in the New Yorker magazine. It recalled how he met her, how their friendship grew and how, at their last lunch in Kensington Palace with -year-old Prince Harry present, he realised that he was about to be dropped from Diana’s court.“I never saw her again,” James concluded. “Neither will anyone  now.”I loved Clive because he made great writing look easy and he made me laugh.As recently as one week ago, a magazine asked Clive what was bothering him at the moment.“Imminent personal extinction,” he replied.And it is a mark of Clive James’ genius that I can’t imagine anyone  in the world coming out with that hilariously honest quip.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Despite what some of them think, Leave voters aren’t stupid and will see through their attempts to hoodwink them.”Sixteen of the  are Labour MPs seeking re-election, having defied voters in the past three years by voting to block, delay and derail Brexit on numerous occasions.Eight are in very heavy Leave areas where up to  per cent backed Brexit.They include high-profile figures such as the former Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, ex-minister Chris Bryant and former shadow Cabinet member Mary Creagh.In total,  General Election candidates have signed a pledge drawn up by the campaign group Remain Labour.It states: “Labour is committed to a confirmatory referendum, to give you the final say on Brexit. If elected as your Labour MP, I pledge to campaign to Remain in the EU.”By contrast, all  Tory candidates have promised to vote in favour of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.But many Labour hopefuls appear to be going back on their word to deliver the will of the people.Mrs Beckett,  defending her Derby South seat where . per cent voted Leave, had previously insisted she accepted the decision her constituents had made. She declared in May : “We have to make the best of it.”Another, Anna Turley — seeking re-election in Redcar where . per cent voted for Brexit — had said: “I will fight for a Brexit that is fair for Teesside”.Wakefield MP Ms Creagh, who declared before the referendum “ we vote to leave, there’s no going back”, is now of the firm belief there is.Jess Phillips has also signed the Remain Pledge despite assuring Birmingham Yardley voters in : “Sixty-odd per cent of constituents want us to leave. I cannot ignore that.”Labour campaign chiefs will this week launch a last-ditch blitz of “Red Wall” Leave-voting constituencies amid evidence working classes are rallying behind Boris Johnson to save Brexit.They face losing a swathe of seats in the north Midlands and Wales, with the biggest swing to Tories in Leave areas.Labour support in Grimsby, held by the party since , has now collapsed dramatically from  per cent in  to just  per cent.Tony Blair’s former seat of Sedgefield, which has not had a Tory MP since , is on BoJo’s target list.An overwhelming . per cent there voted to Leave and sitting MP Phil Wilson said in : “We respect their decisions and voted accordingly in Parliament in favour of Article .” Yet he has since put his name to the “Remain Pledge”.Ilford North’s Wes Streeting has also changed his stance since he said: “I voted to give the people a choice and I will abide by their decision.” Many Labour candidates who have not signed the pledge have barely tried to hide their derision for Leave voters.Sonya Ward, standing in Mansfield, mocked the . per cent who voted Leave there by claiming they “got it wrong, because they didn’t understand”.Tory chairman James Cleverly said last night: “This is a damning indictment of the very people these candidates want to represent, as well as the .million people who voted to leave in .“Despite pledging to respect the result of the referendum, Labour candidates have turned their backs on Brexit in favour of backing a second referendum and stopping Brexit altogether.”Former Labour leader Ed Miliband, defending the Brexit hotbed of Doncaster North, has not signed the pledge.He has been telling his constituents,   per cent Leave, that he voted for a Brexit deal nine times — but Tories pointed out he voted down Theresa May’s and Boris Johnson’s.His double-dealing exposes the scale of panic in Labour’s northern heartlands.Left-wing activist Owen Jones woke up to the Brexit backlash last week, admitting: “If Labour doesn’t do more to win back Leave voters in the North, Midlands and Wales, then Boris Johnson will win a majority.”One candidate revealed they clocked up  miles knocking on doors in their constituency.The source said: “Walking for six or seven hours a day is taking its toll especially in the cold.“People are picking up injuries and we’ve still got two weeks to go.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And  I understand the desire to let yourself off the leash. But it might be one of the few times you find yourself in the same room as your boss — with a chance to impress or ruin your career.You’ll be well aware we are living in the #MeToo era. And we all know, on occasions, it can go too far and that we shouldn’t all be frightened about exactly what we say and who to say it to.To allay your fears, my advice to you isyou want to dance with a colleague, ask her. If she says no then that’s your answer.Compliments are fine by the way. Us women love them , but think of your sister when giving them out.“You look great in that dress” is something you’d say to your sister, and “you look hot in that dress” isn’t.If you are looking at the month ahead and feeling overwhelmed already, this is really the only advice that you need: Start delegating.Write a list of all the jobs that need to be done and then allocate jobs to everyone over the age of ten.Getting your family to pull their weight is the best way to ensure that everyone has a happy Christmas.I know a lot of people dread the season, partly because they have to spend time with tricky in-laws.You can either not invite them  — why ruin your day   — or invite others too . Or just grin and bear it.Lastly,you are struggling with presents, please allow me to share the rules of our traditional Brady Family Christmas Present Game, played by the  members of our family on Christmas Day.Everyone buys four gts, having set a price limit: We have three at £, one at £.Wrap each one beautully so it’s impossible to distinguish premium from Primark. I once placed a roll of toilet paper with Donald Trump’s face on it in a Chanel gt bag — it was the hotly contended present everyone wanted that year . . . until they opened it.You place all gts on the table then take it in turns to throw a dice. When you get a six you pick anyone present you want . Keep throwing until all gts are distributed.Then throw six rounds with two dice and for every six you get you can pinch a present from anyone’s pile.And when it’s done you keep and open the presents you have won. It keeps us occupied for hours.I LOVED the photos of Kelly Brook in the Bahamas, where she is celebrating turning . What a great advert she is for the idea that le begins at !Kelly is naturally beautul with a big smile – and I think she looks absolutely amazing.“Lord Sugar couldn’t relate to me. That was the fundamental problem.“And I started getting that feeling from about week four.”The problem with interviews like this is that it puts her in danger of sounding a little bit like a sore loser.Oh, and also, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Lord Sugar doesn’t particularly like any of them at the moment.CONGRATULATIONS to builder Steve Thomson, , and his we Lenka, , who scooped the  £million EuroMillions jackpot.All their neighbours have said it couldn’t happen to a nicer couple. And I love the fact that the first thing they want to do with the money is given each of their three kids their own bedroom. This is a fairly humble ambition when you consider they are now one of the biggest British Lottery winners of all time.I also love the fact that Steve said he won’t stop working as a builder and will finish all his jobs before Christmas.He’s also already spelled out to his children thatthey want something “you’ll have to earn it”.All of which reveal an outlook that will stand him in very good stead indeed. It might just mean that he will be able to enjoy his win.The fact is money does change people. It also changes the way others see you. Most families will expect something and when they don’t get it will be angry. They will say things such as “we only want a car . . . it’s not much money for you, but would mean a lot to us”.They will expect you to share out your good fortune.My advice would be to think carefully about what to do with it before you make any rash decisions – and get a very good financial adviser.The problem with people who win a lot of money is that they often totally abandon all their values and spend, spend, spend. Let’s hope Steve and Lenka hold on to theirs.Yes, sure, I can see the temptation to magically get rid of the weight that inevitably comes when you have been, you know, growing another human being inside your body.But she only had a baby six weeks ago and,she waits a bit, she’ll probably just lose the baby weight naturally.In the meantime, yet another celeb demonstrates – and adds to – the pressure to “snap back” to their pre-pregnancy figure within weeks! Yes, your body is important but so is your mind!Six weeks after birth seems too soon to me.EVENit is true that the new Calornian craze of “butt sunning” gives you “surges of energy”, better sleep and “more creativity flowing through le”, which is what one devotee called Meagan promised on a recent Instagram post, I can’t see it catching on here.Meagan  says she has incorporated “perineum sunning” – which involves presenting the area between the anus and vulva to the sun – in to her “daily rising routine”.But talk about the sun shining out of your ar*e…what on earth must the neighbours think.ULRIKA JONSSON is on a dating app for people over   Good for her. She deserves another chance at happiness –  and at  she’s got a lot of le ahead of her.A lot of jokes are made at the expense of Ulrika’s love le and the fact she has had four kids by four men.

This is a story of being trafficked, this is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guys royalty.Prince Andrew categorically denies he had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Ms Roberts.The documentary revealed:Royal commentator Penny Junor said Ms Roberts came across as a more sympathetic character compared with his own car crash Newsnight interview.She said: This is about as bad as it gets for Andrew.Virginia Roberts sounds very plausible in this interview, while most of Andrews excuses in his interview with Emily Maitlis were laughable.She also comes across as a much more sympathetic character so viewers will warm to her.This made gruelling watching and the stories these girls tell are terrying.Jeffrey Epstein was a monster andwhat the girls say aboutGhislaine Maxwell is true, then she was no better.Whether Andrew actually slept with Virginia Roberts I think is still unproven.On Twitter people praised Ms Roberts for her bravery in speaking out.Writer Kate Maltby tweeted: Watching Virginia Roberts Gufre on #Panorama. Clear, calm, confident. I can’t imagine the bravery it takes to go up against the British Royal Family.Another commentator wrote: Well done Panorama!! You have given Virginia Roberts a most valuable opportunity to bravely recall her story.She came across brave, authentic and convincing unlike Prince Andrew.Another tweeted: Virginia Roberts is incredibly brave to give this interview, but Im really glad she has.Historian Kate Williams tweeted: Virginia Roberts is a brave woman to speak out and keep doing so, despite all those who wish she wouldnt.I hope that there are efforts made to expose more of those in #Epstein’s circle - lot of powerful men involved in this.In graphic and detailed testimony, Ms Roberts told Panorama sex with the duke was disgusting.She said: It didnt last very long, the whole entire procedure. It was disgusting. He wasnt mean or anything but he got up and he said thanks and walked out.I sat there in bed, just horried and ashamed and felt dirty. I had to get up and have a shower.She added: The next day, Ghislainetells me I did a really good job. She pats me on the back and said You made him really happy.In tears, Ms Roberts said: It was a wicked time in my le. It was a really scary time in my le. I had just been abused by a member of the royal family. These powerful people were my chains.The mum-of-three added: I implore the people in the UK to stand up beside me, to help me fight this fight, to not accept this as being OK.The show also examined the infamous photograph of Andrew pictured with his arm wrapped around her waist at Maxwells house.The duke has said he had no memory of the photo being taken and questioned whether it was his own hand in the image.Ms Roberts insisted the photo was genuine and she gave the original to the FBI in .She said: The people on the inside are going to keep coming up with these ridiculous excuses.Like his arm was elongated or the photo was doctored, or he came to New York to break up with Jeffrey Epstein. I mean, come on, Im calling BS on this, because thats what it is.He knows what happened. I know what happened and theres only one of us telling the truth, and I know thats me.Meanwhile the Panorama investigation disclosed that five women who allege they were victims of paedophile Epstein are calling on Andrew to give a testimony in their civil court case.Panorama claimed it had also uncovered an email allegedly sent by Andrew in  to Maxwell.In it, the duke is reported to have asked for Ms Maxwells help in dealing with claims by Ms Roberts.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said in response to the allegations on Panorama: It is emphatically denied that The Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is  and without foundation.On the dukes association with Epstein, the palace spokesman added: The Duke of York unequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. Epsteins suicide left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims.The Duke deeply sympathises with those affected who want some form of closure. It is his hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives.The Duke is willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations,required.The Duke has already stated that he did not see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to Jeffrey Epsteins arrest and conviction.He deplores the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behaviour.Ms Roberts interview took place before the Dukes car crash appearance on Newsnight.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

mentioned in The Bible - was one of the glories of the ancient world, with its walls and mythic hanging gardens listed among the Seven Wonders.Founded around  BC, it was the capital of ten dynasties in Mesopotamia and the birthplace of writing and literature.Now, over  years after Husseins execution, his palatial tribute to the emperor has become a ghostly shell.The once-grand palace halls are daubed with graffiti and broken glass litters the floors.Shisha-smoking teenagers and families gather on Husseins vast balconies overlooking the complex spread of Babylon, whose replica Ishtar gate is made from gaudy blue bricks polished off with gold overlay.In , Hussein started rebuilding the city on top of the old ruins, investing in both restoration and new construction.Because of this, some artacts may well be under the city by now.To the dismay of archaeologists, Hussein inscribed his name on many of the bricks in imitation of Nebuchadnezzar.One inscription reads: This was built by Saddam Hussein, son of Nebuchadnezzar, to glory Iraq.Brutalist reliefs depict Hussein leading soldiers on the battlefield, while the ceilings are painted with symbols of Iraqi civilisation, from Babylonian lions to towers that Hussein built in Baghdad.Kanan Makiya, an Iraqi author and professor at Brandeis University who has written a book on Saddam’s building projects, told atlasobscura: Babylon is neither Islamic nor Arab—it is obviously deeply pre-Islamic.In celebrating Babylon and reconstructing the city of Babylon, what one is doing is essentially calling upon the idea of Iraq—not the idea of Arabism, or the idea of Baghdad as the spearhead of a new pan-Arabism in the region, or Islamism, but Iraq.In recent years, the Iraqi authorities have reopened Babylon to tourists, hoping that one day the site will attract visitors from all over the world.Following excavations in the early th century, European archaeologists claimed key features such as the remains of the famous Ishtar Gate - the glazed brick gate decorated with images of dragons and aurochs, built in about  BC by order of King Nebuchadnezzar II as the eighth gate to the inner city.He was known for his military might, the splendour of his capital, Babylon, and his important part in Jewish history.The first Babylonian Empire reached its peak in the second millennium BC before collapsing.However, in  BC, Nebuchadnezzar II broke the power of the Assyrians.He re-established Babylonia before going on to conquer Jerusalem, destroying the Jewish Temple and taking thousands of Jewish armed men, workers, and the King of Judah back to captivity in Babylon.Whenever Nebuchadnezzar made a conquest, he used the stolen wealth to build monuments to his own glory.It was in his capital city that Nebuchadnezzar built the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon.In testimony to his grandeur, each brick was inscribed with Nebuchadnezzars name.Abdulamir al-Hamdani, Iraqs minister of culture, described the city as “Saddam’s Babylon” rather than an accurate reconstruction.“We admit this was the wrong way to do conservation but it was a chaotic time in Iraq then, and it was done without external consultations.It fell into neglect after the US-led  invasion of Iraq. Further damage was inflicted by US and Polish soldiers who used it as a military base."},{"url":null,"title":"top tory says its firms","story":"NewsTop Tory says its for US firms to decidethey hike drug prices after BrexitDominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, said a price hike was hugely unlikely and insisted drugs prices were not on the table in a trade deal - but said the Americans will take their decisionsShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video dominic-raab-says-its-up-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ GLB- ,  UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics top-tory-says-its-firms-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the Americans will take their decisions despite dismissing Labour claims that costs could soar in a UK-US trade deal.He added: I think itaposs hugely unlikely, why would they do that, whataposs the interest  Sky News host Adam Boulton replied: Well getting more money thataposs why. Labour claimed the exchange vindicated Jeremy Corbynaposs warnings that prices the NHS pays for key medicines could rise as part of a trade deal.In , UK pharmaceutical spending was £ per person while in the US it was £, according to the OECD. And leaked briefings last week showed UK officials had described drugs patents and costs as a key consideration going forward. It came as Donald Trump today insisted he wouldnapost demand access to the NHS in a post-Brexit trade deal evenyou handed it to us on a silver platter.Boris Johnson said he could categorically rule out that any part of the NHS will be on the table in any trade negotiations, including pharmaceuticals, adding: This is pure Loch Ness Monster, Bermuda Triangle stuff.But Labouraposs Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: Dominic Raab has finally admitted what we all know - Boris Johnson is opening the door to a Trump trade deal that will force our NHS bills through the roof. It could cost the NHS £ million a week which will mean more procedures cut, queues for care getting longer and fewer doctors and nurses. Mr Raab was questioned by Sky News after describing a UK-US trade deal as a win-win for business and shoppers, with cheaper prices in the shops. Interviewer Adam Boulton said: That means letting them have access to our markets, possibly even our health market, doesnapost it  Mr Raab replied: Not the health market. Weaposve ruled that out. The NHS is not up for grabs in any trade deal. We would walk away from a trade deal that suggested that was the case. But youaposre right, reducing barriers to trade on both sides is a win-win. It increases business activity, itaposs good for businesses and creating the jobs for the future, but it also gives the consumer a better deal because theyaposve got cheaper prices and greater choice. Mr Boulton pressed on: As I understand it, we canapost guarantee when we leave the EU that we will pay the same amount for American drugs in future, that they might decide to jack up the price, is that right  Mr Raab replied: Well look, the Americans will take their decisions, but what weaposre saying is -. Mr Boulton cut in: Which could be to jack up the price  Mr Raab replied: No, I think itaposs hugely unlikely, why would they do that, whataposs the interest -. To which Mr Boulton said: Well getting more money thataposs why. Tory Mr Raab said: Well no notyou reduce the amount, er, volume of purchase. But the key point in this is we will do the right thing by the patients, the consumers in this country and whether it comes to drug pricing or any other involvement of American firms that is not on the table for negotiation. It will be decided in this country, for the best interests of UK consumers and patients.It comes shortly after Mr Raab was skewered on BBC Radio aposs Today programme, where presenter Nick Robinson brought up a  book in which he and four other Tories called for more private providers in the NHS. Speaking as Donald Trump touched down in the UK for the NATO summit, Mr Raab told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: I can tell you categorically Iaposve never advocated privatisation of the NHS.

Following a ten month long pay dispute UPS staff in Barton, Staffordshire have decided to strike. On December  HGV and shunter drivers employed by UPS at Argos’ flagship distribution centre will form a picket line, Birmingham Live reported. If an agreement over pay is not agreed, they will strike until December . The knock on effect for Christmas shoppers across the country could be signicant. The Barton site is a critical hub of Argos’ national network from which smart phones, laptops and televisions are shipped to regional Argos distribution centres for delivery to stores. Unite warned that without the shunter and HGV drivers to manoeuvre loads on and off the centre, work at the site would effectively grind to a halt, causing severe disruption to the Sainsbury’s owned chain. Rick Coyle, Unite regional officer, said: “Unite has been waiting for an offer in response to our members pay claim since March. Drivers and shunters have been treated with contempt and have had enough. “UPS is claiming that it has engaged with the pay claim. In reality, our members only received an offer of a voucher scheme that was so devoid of details that it could not be put to a ballot. “Our members do not want to cause disruption for Argos customers over the Christmas period, but they have been left with no choice but to strike. “The treatment of these Barton workers has been disgraceful. The reputations of UPS and Argos are at risk during the peak Christmas period because of this refusal to meaningfully engage with the pay claim.  “It is now up to UPS to ensure this dispute does not extend right across the busiest time of the year for Argos by tabling a sensible offer that our members can actually vote on.” The industrial action comes after a pay claim submitted in March by Unite on behalf of the workers was disregarded. Unite members nine to one in favour of strike action.

Like all schoolboys he also loves to play but there is no space for that – or even to do his homework in peace. He says: “Le in the BB is horrible, it’s worse than being in a real-le horror film. There’s no room to do anything. EvenI’m reading my book, I’m still going to get annoyed by someone. “I’ve been told off by someone for running in the small corridor. You can’t do much, you can’t play much.” The family sleep in one room and share kitchen facilities with the rest of the BB, in Ilford, East London.Will adds: “Sometimes me and Harry fight for the one chair, because we both want to sit at the table. I find it really hard to do my homework.” The brothers are among the soaring number of homeless children across Britain, increasing by one every eight minutes, according to charity Shelter. Some , youngsters will spend Christmas in temporary accommodation, a report by the charity found. Child homelessness is at its highest rate in  years, with  kids losing their homes each day last year. And for the , families with children living in emergency BBs and hostels, conditions are often sub-standard with little privacy, security or space to cook, the report found. Will’s family lost their rented home in a Section  no-fault eviction, which allows landlords to evict tenants without a reason when their fixed-term tenancy ends.Their landlord wanted to sell and thought it would be easier without a family living in the property. But with no time to save and increasingly unaffordable rents, they found themselves without enough cash for a deposit for a new rental home.  The ending of a private tenancy is the reason % of households in England became homeless or threatened with homelessness in the past year. Will says: “We moved here in September and they said we were going to stay for six weeks. “Then they told us we were going to stay for two more, then they told us it will be another week, then another one.” Will adds: “I love to read my book at the end of the day but my brother Harry needs to go to bed and we need to turn off the lights, which means I can’t see the pages. It’s really annoying that I can’t go to sleep in the bed that we share, as I have school and sometimes I am really miserable because I didn’t get a good night’s sleep. And Harry, he doesn’t like being woken up early when he hasn’t had a good night’s sleep. He sometimes falls asleep at school.” The number of children living in temporary accommodation has soared by % in Britain in the past five years. And in England, there are an additional , families with children who are homeless but have sourced their own temporary accommodation.  These families are not included in Shelter’s figures but are also officially without a home. Shelter warned that at current rates a further , children will be made homeless between now and the General Election on December . This will grow to , by Christmas. Chief executive Polly Neate says: “The fact  children become homeless every day is a scandalous figure and a reminder that political promises about tackling homelessness must be turned into action. Day in, day out we see the devastating impact the housing emergency is having on children. “They are being uprooted from friends, living in cold, cramped BBs and going to bed at night scared by the sound of strangers outside.” Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey slammed Tory cuts to housing benefits and the lack of investment. He says: “Rising homelessness is a direct result of decisions made by the Tories: slashing investment in new low-cost homes, refusing to help private renters and making huge cuts to housing benefit and homelessness services. “A Labour Government will end rough sleeping within five years and fix the root causes of rising homelessness with the biggest council and social housing programme since the s, stronger rights for renters and extra funding for homelessness services.” Your vote can help to tackle this disgrace, by Darren Lewis I still remember the times as a child when my dad struggled to find the cash-in-hand work that would keep us going. On those occasions “dinner” would consist of improvised meals, scraped together with the very last contents of the cupboard or fridge. Sometimes it would be even less than that. We lived at a time when, even after the Race Relations Act of , your CV didn’t matteran employer wanted to give a job to someone who didn’t look like you. Taking seconds at school dinner times was commonplace, as you didn’t know how big or small the evening meal would be at home. Four decades on, it is a scandal that thousands of children continue to live this.Channel ’s Dispatches documentary, Britain’s Breadline Kids, proved a harrowing insight into the scale of the problem. The sight of eight-year-old Courtney opening her fridge to find just an empty tomato ketchup bottle was heartbreaking. As was seeing her younger brother in bed with his coat on to keep warm. Delays in the Universal Credit system meant their mum Charlotte had to wait over a month for money after fleeing abuse. And still the Government reckons all ordinary people want is to Get Brexit Done  This is the politics we care about. Parents want to feed their kids without having to negotiate red tape. Girls Courtney’s age should be focused on school and Santa. Our country is going backwards. We need to use our votes to affect change.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMillions of us squeeze, pour and spoon the stuff out for our furry friends every day - but most have next to no clue what goes into the pet foods we buy. And much of what people think they know is, in fact, way wide of the mark. So in an effort to clear up some of the biggest pet food myths, weaposve called in pet food giants PURINA to set the record straight. PURINA has been one of the leaders in the advancement of pet care and pet nutrition for over  years, so who better to ask ! MYTH: Only food unfit for humans goes into pet food  The truth: Not at all. Strict legislation ensures anything coming from animals which is included within pet food comes from animals certied as fit for human consumption. No euthanized pets, roadkill or sick animals go into our pet foods, and we only use animals from trusted suppliers, and all these suppliers  must adhere to the stringent safety and welfare regulations we set as a business. PURINA pet foods contain animal-based raw materials from the same animals we eat, such as beef, lamb, poultry and pork. Many of these are animal ‘by-products’, which are often referred to as ‘meat and animal derivatives’ on pet food labels. People tend to think animal ‘by-products’ are poor quality ingredients but actually, they come from the same animals that we ourselves are eating they just tend to be parts of the animal that we view as culturally unpalatable – such as kidneys, liver and lungs. Far from being poor quality, however, they’re in fact excellent sources of protein and other nutrients, including essential fatty acids, iron and some B group vitamins. Dogs and cats also find them delicious! MYTH: Animals donapost need extra vitamins and minerals in their diets like humans do    The truth: Like humans, cats and dogs require the correct balance of vitamins and minerals to maintain body structures and vital s and they rely on obtaining at least some of these from their food Vitamins support a range of body s, including the immune system, eye-sight, bone structure, muscles and joints. Minerals help balance body fluids, support metabolic processes and build strong bones and teeth. All PURINA main meal products are ‘complete and balanced’ this means they contain all of the minerals and vitamins, as well as other nutrients, that a cat or dog needs, at the correct levels for that pet. This means you shouldn’t need to add anything  to the food as a vitamin or mineral supplement – and actually adding additional  things could be harmful. Many homemade diets tend to be lacking in vitamins and or minerals, causing nutrient imbalances and longer-term potentially having adverse health consequences. MYTH: Fish isnapost that healthy for animals to eat The truth: Fish is an excellent source of high quality protein – this is why we use it in many of our PURINA pet food recipes. Proteins are the building blocks of the body, essential for growth and repair. Proteins help release energy and form muscle, skin, hair, antibodies and hormones.  Fish oil is also an excellent source of the essential omega  fatty acids which can support healthy bodily , including brain and vision development in growing animals. It can also help to  support their joints when they become older. MYTH: Pet foods are packed full of colourants The truth: Colours are only used in our products in small amounts. The colours and all other additives that we use are carefully regulated by a number of authoritiestogether with the European Commission. They are permitted for use in cat, dog and human food in all EU member states,  have undergone rigorous safety checks before their inclusion and are certied as safe to use. Did you know, in fact, that ‘E’ numbers are a ‘barcode’ for identying things, including colourants, in a simple way  The E stands for ‘Europe’ and is actually a stamp of approval, rather than something to be suspicious of. \u2028 Many of the colourants used within our PURINA pet foods are natural rather than articial ones. They  do not have adverse health effects. All PURINA products also comply with the strict UK and EU legislation for pet food to ensure they are safe and nutritionally balanced. MYTH: Some pet foods are too fatty and could be putting my animal at risk  The truth: We often worry about ‘good’ and ‘bad’ fats in our own diets but, unlike humans, it is generally considered in veterinary medicine that cats and dogs are not at the same risk of clogged arteries. Fats are an essential part of pet diets and an important source of energy, providing more than twice as much energy as protein or carbohydrate. Fats also improve the taste and digestibility of pet food. Essential fatty acids are important for your pet’s overall health, such as a glossy coat and good skin, healthy joints, a healthy immune system, reproduction and helping to remove waste from the body. There are some pet foods out there which are quite high in fat, and others that are much lower. It is worth checking the nutrient analysis to find an appropriate fat level for your pet: some pets – particularly those doing a lot of exercise or growing rapidly – may benefit from an increased fat level, whereas those which are overweight or more sedate may need a lower fat level. Some fat is good – it is just about making sure you feed a pet food with the right balance! MYTH: Salt isnapost important as part of an animalaposs diet The truth: Sodium is one of the essential dietary minerals required by cats and dogs. Salt in the form of sodium chloride plays an important role in helping the nervous system to work effectively and has numerous other s in the body too. The correct balance of certain minerals, called electrolytes , are also closely tied to supporting water balance to stop the body having too littleor too much water. The amount of sodium in PURINA pet food is only present at safe levels and is part of a % complete and balanced diet.

Richard Brittain went  miles from his home in Bedford to the Asda store in Fe where Paige Rolland worked in order to smash the teenager over the head with a full bottle of wine.The  Countdown series champion used Facebook to track down the Fe woman, who was  at the time, after she criticised a book that he wrote, The Daily Record reported .Having been released after serving half of his  month sentence, Brittain has contacted his terried victim again - despite being subject to an indefinite non-harassment order. He sent a handwritten note to her home address claiming that nothing was real except their love and that he would love her forever. Brittain also referred to Paige as his Scottish thistle before signing off This page is torn because we are torn without each other.” Paige, who has moved to a secret address for her safety, suffers from severe anxiety, takes medication for her mental health issues and has dropped out of university since the attack. She said: “I live in fear every day he’s going to track me down again. “I want people to know what this man is capable of – and nobody seems able to stop him.  “I was offered victim support at the time but ended up in private therapy. “I just feel the justice system is geared towards the perpetrator and not the victim. It doesn’t take into account the long-term needs of a victim of an unprovoked attack. “He obviously didn’t fear going back to prison or he wouldn’t have gone to such s to track down my home address again. “Prison didn’t change him or rehabilitate him.” Brittain, who was locked up in , sent Paige a private Facebook message following his release. “I dreamed of you last night. Are you going to send me back to prison  he wrote. “Maybe I need it – I’m bored out of my mind.  “How is the nursing degree going  I was quite surprised they revealed such information about you in court. “I was tempted to get a bus ticket to Dundee and come visit you but I thought that might look weird. “Any chance we could just become friends actually  We could keep our communications secret like we did in last night’s dream.” The -year-old later sent a follow up message begging Paige not to tell anyone about the first one. He also penned numerous sick poems about her on his blog, which has since been deleted. One mentions a “Scotch tartan queen”, adding: “In the cereal aisle we made contact with one another.” When Paige, now , received the letter she contacted Police Scotland. Brittain was reported to the procurator fiscal, who decided not to proceed with charges due to the stalker’s mental health.  It’s understood he is in a psychiatric ward in England. Paige said that she could have died have she been hit any harder by Brittain. Despite the brutal nature of the attack and the mental issues she is dealing with, Paige was refused criminal injury compensation because she suffered no long term physical effects following the attack. “What about the mental effects  she added. My le has changed completely. I was going to be a midwe and should be almost qualied now. Instead, I’m fighting a battle every day because of what he did to me. “There needs to be greater emphasis on the mental well-being of victims of crime and support for however long they need it. “I might have coped a lot betterhe hadn’t continued to stalk me after he left prison.” Brittain attacked Paige in October  after she left an online review of a story he had uploaded to the internet. The pair had never met. Prosecutor Harry Findlay told Glasgow Sherf Court during the resultant trial: “The complainer had read some of that material and gave feedback of what she thought to be the merits or otherwise of the book. “The feedback was negative. What followed were comments made by the accused, which give an indication that he was displeased.” Brittain went to the Glenrothes Asda and approached Paige from behind with a bottle of wine, striking her with enough force to leave a gaping wound in her head. Mr Findlay told the court: “She was kneeling down collecting cereal from the bottom shelf of the aisle. “While doing so, the accused approached without warning, any provocation or words and he struck the complainer on the back of the head with the bottle. “One blow. It made contact and the wound bled immediately and she had a moment of unconsciousness. Brittain was also convicted of using Twitter and Instagram to stalk and terrorise another young woman, Ella Durant.She blocked him from her social media accounts. But Ella told how, after moving from London to Glasgow, she spotted Brittain on the city’s Buchanan Street. Two days later, he was waiting for her when she left work. She found a link to a blog called The Benevolent Stalker, which made reference to her.

The child was allegedly made to perform sex acts in a churchyard, raped above a shop on a filthy mattress and abused when she tried to refuse their advances. A court heard how the victim was urinated on by one of the five men, all of whom went on trial today. The offences are said to have taken place in and around Telford, Shropshire, and went on for some years. The alleged victim is now an adult, Birmingham Crown Court was told.  Michelle Heeley QC, prosecuting, said: This case involves the sexual exploitation of a young girl, a girl passed around like a piece of meat for the sexual gratication of several young men, some of whom are in the dock. Each of these defendants deny that they in any way abused anyone. The prosecution say, having heard the evidence, you can be sure they did. She was befriended at a time when she was low, by a man called Tanveer Ahmed. Ahmed worked making takeaway deliveries for Perfect Pizza in the town, with jurors told the location was relevant, as the alleged victim claimed she was assaulted above the shop. The jury heard Ahmed was not on trial alongside the other five defendants, having been deported to Pakistan for other unrelated offences. After befriending the young girl, it was alleged Ahmed started forcing her to perform sex acts with other men. Ms Heeley said: One night he drove her to a flat above a shop, he took her into a room where there were three older men, and he told her she had to have sex with these men. She did not want to have sex but she was forced to, she was pushed down on to an old dirty mattress, and raped, said Ms Heeley.  She saw money exchange hands. Sadly for her, this did not happen just once, but on other occasions, when she was spat on and raped - all orchestrated by Tanveer Ahmed. He himself forced her to perform oral sex on him, andshe refused he would call her a slag, slap her and leave her stranded in random areas in Telford. Ahmed continued selling her for sex, including passing her details on to men, the prosecution said. Jurors heard this is how the girl came into contact with the first defendant, Mohammed Ali Sultan, , formerly of Telford. Ali Sultan is facing four charges of indecent assault and one of rape. Jurors were told: Ali Sultan would take her to meet other men, in the same way Tanveer Ahmed had, men would phone her and Ali Sultan and Tanveer Ahmed would make her answer, and do what the men wanted. The abuse took place at a number of locations, including above Perfect Pizza and in a churchyard in Wellington, amongst others. Ali Sultan would verbally abuse her, calling her a sl**, and on occasions slap her, or pull her hair. On a later occasion he allegedly raped her, coercing her into repeatedly meeting up by threatening to tell people at her school what she was doing. Ali Sultan is also charged in connection with a third incident, at the churchyard, when he allegedly became violent after she refused his advances.  The jury of six men and six women were told he already had convictions in both  and  for similar offences against young girls. Another of the alleged victimaposs alleged abusers is -year-old Amjad Hussain, of Telford, who is accused of forcing her to perform oral sex on two separate occasions. A third man, -year-old Shafiq Younas, from Wellington, is accused of orally raping the youngster in the same churchyard in Wellington. Another male, Nazam Akhtar, of Wellington, has been charged with rape, in an incident in which the girl was allegedly driven to a lane in a car along with Ali Sultan, Hussain, and another male.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry set up their page after their wedding, and have been delighting people with photos and videos ever since.And while many well-wishers just assume the account is run by a member of their staff, some eagle-eyed fans believe Meghan is the one at the keypad after spotting a big clue. One of their recent posts looks ahead to the Christmas, with the couple asking people to think of people in need over the Christmas period. But instead of saying Christmas, they say festive holiday season, a phrase more commonly used in the States. The post reads: With the festive holiday season upon us, it’s also a reminder to reflect on those in need – those who may feel lonely, hungry, homeless, or may be experiencing the holidays for the first time without loved ones. It’s an important time of year to help those around you who may be less fortunate, or who would appreciate even the smallest act of kindness. Continuing our monthly tradition of highlighting accounts that do good, and inspired by the “Twelve Days of Christmas” - we have selected twelve organisations caring for those in need - especially at this time of year.There are, thankfully, so many organisations around the world doing good on global and grassroots levels, many of which are not on Instagram . Check out the accounts we have chosen and please share those in your own communities that are making a dference. We would love to hear about the ones that inspire you - so please tell us and add your country’s flag! People praised Meghan and Harryaposs post and thanked them for sharing the message, and many people were quick to spot the American term. They believe itaposs a sign that the Duchess writes the posts herself. However some people werenapost as happy with the wording. One wrote: It’s Christmas please, not the ‘holiday season’ - that’s American. We are a Christian country and you have both been baptised and christened. I am very happy to honour others’ holidays but this, that we celebrate on th Dec is Christmas.  Another replied: Iaposm sorry but its called Christmas not festive holidays. Itaposs not the first time fans have spotted an Americanisms in the posts.Back in April the couple used the account to thank people for donating to charity as part of an unofficial baby shower and in lieu of gts for baby Archie.It references diapers instead of nappies, cribs instead of cots and backpacks instead of rucksacks.

Lukasz Koczocik, , grabbed the ft-long ceremonial pole from the walls of Fishmongersapos Hall and tackled Khan during the attack last Friday. Sadly, two former Cambridge university students died in the devastating attack  - Saskia Jones, , and Jack Merritt,  - but witnesses say more people could have lost their livesMr Koczocik had not not stepped in to fight back. Mr Koczocik had been washing glasses in the basement at the time and ran upstairs after hearing desperate screams coming from upstairs.  The kitchen worker launched at the -year-old terrorist and thrust the pike into his chest to stall the attack, while a second hero grabbed a narwhal tusk from the walls as a weapon and a third used a fire extinguisher. Mr Koczocik has since been praised by his boss for his bravery. CEO of Fishmongersapos Hall Commodore Toby Williamson told the BBC: aposHeaposs the guy who cleans the glasses down in the basement and thataposs exactly what he was doing when he hears this scream. aposThe scream was so loud that, as a first aider, he makes a choice. He goes towards the trouble. He gets there on the first floor of the building just behind me and itaposs pretty clear that thereaposs a bad guy.  aposHeaposs got two knives in his hands, thereaposs blood, thereaposs screams, thereaposs chaos. aposLukasz pulls off the wall this long stick, he charges towards the bad guy, and he impacts him on the chest and thereaposs clearly something here that is protective and it doesnapost make any sort of impact. aposBut heaposs buying time. He allows others to escape, to move to adjacent rooms. At that point heaposs got about one-minute of one-on-one straight combat.apos  The attacker had managed to stab the hero kitchen worker four or five times in the left of his body, but despite being seriously injured, he refused to give up, Mr Williamson said. The battle spilled out in to the main hall, where a conference organised by a University of Cambridge programme called Learning Together was being held.Khan attempted to flee down the main staircase to the front-door when he realised the scale of numbers against him, MailOnline reports.A doorman named Gary rushed to hold the door shut so that another worker, Dawn, could ring the emergency services and hit the alarms.  Khan then started to attack two cloakroom girls, named as Alla and Sandra, before stabbing a maintenance man named Andy, Mr Williamson said. The attacker then managed to burst out of the hall onto London Bridge, but the CEO said Mr Koczocik still aposlead the attackapos against him, trying to restrain him.  Mr Koczocik shouted at members of the public to get back before collapsing to the floor from the blood loss as the battle continued onto the bridge.

Although there was some scepticism over whether the photo was real or not, another user pointed out that in  American aircraft guidelines changed to allow passengers to take designated service animals on board. So eventhis particular photo is a fake, miniature horses have been spotted in airports and on planes before . And people had concerns.

The mummied body showed the animalaposs hair, teeth, whiskers and even eyelashes in pristine condition. Russian scientists found the prehistoric canine hidden in a lump of frozen mud near the city Yakutsk last year and have put it on show at the cityaposs Mammoth Museum on Monday. Nikolai Androsov, director of the Northern World private museum, said: This puppy has all its limbs, pelage - fur, even whiskers. The nose is visible. There are teeth. We can determine due to some data that it is a male. Scientists from the Stockholm-based Centre or Palaeogenetics examined the animalaposs DNA for radio carbon dating and found that the animal was roughly , years old. But it was unsurethe species belonged to a dog or a wolf.  Professor Love Dalen, from evolutionary genetics at the centre said: We have now generated a nearly complete genome sequence from it and normally when you have a two-fold coverage genome, which is what we have, you should be able to relatively easily say whether it is a dog or a wolf. But we still can’t say and that makes it even more interesting. Researchers believe the puppy, which was named Dogor, died when it was two months old. The cause of itaposs death remains unclear.  The permafrost conditions helped to preserve the puppyaposs soft tissues, milk teeth, fur, eyelashes and even whiskers. In recent years, scientists in Yakutia have found a number of frozen prehistoric animals, including a woolly rhino cub and cave lion cubs.

I think he got around  in his short time here.“His attitude was phenomenal. He was no big-time Charlie – a nicer guy you couldn’t meet.“Everyone at the club loved big Louis. He would come over from Fe on the bus two nights a week for training. Nothing was a problem for him. He would pick up the cones or lend a hand with the kit.“On a match day, any instructions our manager Jamie McCunnie gave him, he carried them out to a T.”Finlayson reckons Appere’s future in the game may not stop at Tannadice.“His attitude means football should hold no barriers for him. He’ll give everything he’s got.“He used us as a . It was a chance to get playing men’s football. He said he would give it his best shot.“It was a fantastic opportunity and he took it with both hands. He came to us as a boy and left the club as a man.”Although dferent types of players, Finlayson says there are similarities between Appere and Murray, a player he worked with at another local junior club, Violet.Finlayson continued: “John McGlashan brought Simon to Violet.“He was a great lad, a bit older, a bit mischievous and a bit more street-wise than Louis.“But when that whistle went he was totally focused. In that respect he was very similar to Louis.“When he came to the club we were struggling against relegation but his goals and performances lted us up the table.“He was working as a plumber at the time but his performances saw him move to Tayport, then quickly on to Arbroath and Dundee United.“He’s since played for Hibs and Dundee and now he’s down in South Africa turning out for Bidvest Wits.“He’s done very well for himself.”Finlayson admits junior football isn’t for everyone but he reckons it can be either the path into senior football or a learning curve for young pros.He went on: “Players must have the right attitude to play junior football.“There can sometimes be a wee bit of senior snobbery. Not every club will send players out to the juniors.“But the likes of Peterhead boss Jim McInally is always in touch to see what’s going on and who the better players are.“Playing in the juniors can sometimes tell you a lot more about a young lad than, say, turning out in games in the U  league for their senior teams.“I’m convinced many would benefit more from a season in junior football.“However, they must have the right mentality – Louis and Simon certainly had that.“Junior football should not be discredited – it’s character- building.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/SNS-19652080-Dundee-v-Dundee-Utd.jpg ","title":"cammy kerr keen to finish month off on a high at home to queens","story":"Dundee need to go “full throttle” from the first whistle tomorrow to finish off a disappointing November on a high.That’s the view of Dark Blues full-back Cammy Kerr as he and his team-mates prepare for the visit of Queen of the South.Dundee started the month on a high as a home win over Morton made it three successes on the bounce but the two matches since then have ended in disappointing defeats to rivals Dundee United and Inverness.With no more international breaks until spring, this is the time of the year where form can make or break a season.And Kerr is keen to see Dundee head into the Christmas period with a morale-boosting three points against the Doonhamers.He told the Tele: “It’s been a frustrating month, we came into it on the back of a few victories but the last two haven’t been so good in the derby and then away at Inverness.“Again we just need to pick ourselves up – there’s been a lot of that this year where we’ve gone on a wee run, stalled, wee run, stalled.“It’s about getting that consistency, people go on about that all the time but it is important.“This time of the season is a great time to build a bit of momentum.“Looking at the table, ideally we’d want to be higher up, we are in the play-off position but we want to be kicking on.“At this football club, we don’t just settle for being in the mix, we want to push on – that’s something that’s very much in the players’ thoughts.”Dundee’s last match at Dens Park wasn’t one to remember for home fans and full-back Kerr is keen to banish those memories by getting off to a positive start to tomorrow’s Championship clash.He added: “It’s so important to try to get off to a good start, go full throttle from the start.“We need to take the game to teams, especially at Dens.“Not every game works out like that, though people think Dundee should go winning every game.“Everyone here wants to do that but teams set up dferently, they sit in and make things very dficult.“There are a lot of good teams in this league, teams that outsiders maybe write off but they are all very dficult sides.”He added: “The home record this season has been better bar the derby and the Partick defeats.“We want to build this place up and get the fans happy.“We’re just as gutted as them from the derby and last week’s defeat. We’ll keep striving to get up that table.”Kerr and the rest of the Dundee backline were pleasantly surprised this week by theof goalkeeper Jack Hamilton.The former Hearts man is set to make his comeback to the squad tomorrow after almost six weeks out after appendix surgery.“Everyone in the goalkeeping department has been great this season,” Kerr added.“Big Jack Hamilton has been outstanding for us this year and then we had Conor Hazard come in. He had a big jersey to fill with Jack being out ill.“We’ve also got Calum Ferrie who has been unfortunate not to play and what a goalkeeper he is.“A lot of that is down to the work done by Rab Geddes, the goalie coach, who works tirelessly with them.”Heading into the weekend, Dundee trail leaders United by a massive  points, prompting talk of the Tangerines having one hand on the trophy already.Kerr knows the Dark Blues can’t go believing that, however.“We only focus on the games we can win. It would be naive to say United have won the league – we’ll let people think thatthey want but our task is game by game and that starts tomorrow at home to Queens to try to pick up three points.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.48766963-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.48766963-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.48766963-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/12/2.48766963-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee bar manager who bared buttocks has licence renewed","story":"A bar manager has apologised and been allowed to continue selling alcohol after baring his backside in public and shouting at staff in a Dundee restaurant.George Finlay, , said he was #embarrassed and red faced# by his behaviour on April  this year, which led to a conviction for behaving in a threatening or abusive manner at Dundee Sherf Court.Dundee City Licensing Board was told that Finlay had been seen to bare his buttocks as he crossed the road at Crichton Street as he and his we walked towards the steps up to City Square.He then attempted to enter the Italian Grill restaurant in the square but was refused service, after which he doled out abuse to staff before leaving.Finlay, a personal licence holder in Dundee, had appeared before the Dundee city licensing board to discuss his conviction before councillors agreed to renew his permit to sell alcohol.A police representative told the board that a serving police inspector had reported seeing Finlay #stand in the middle of the road with his underwear and trousers down, exposing his buttocks#.She added: #Hiswe has attempted to pull up his trousers.

Doran again was the tormentor-in-chief as he raced down the left but his cross aimed at Jordan White was put behind for a corner by Meekings.It was the Dark Blues# turn to threaten moments later as Jordan McGhee showed good footwork before picking out McGowan at the back post. His shot on the turned was charged down by Brad Mckay before Mark Ridgers comfortably gathered Mackie#s follow-up effort.Five minutes before half-time, Dundee had two glorious opportunities to equalise. First Hemmings saw a shot charged down by Donaldson just yards from goal after a terric delivery by Declan McDaid from the right.Seconds later, Caley Jags captain Carl Tremarco had to head off the line as ICT almost turned the ball into their own net after a stramash in the area.The second period didn#t spring into le until just after the hour-mark when Doran was played clean through but was soon stopped in his tracks by Hazard as he tried to round the big keeper.Sub Danny Johnson poked wide for the Dee moments later as the visitors started to assert themselves on the game.Fellow-replacement Josh Todd dragged an effort narrowly wide on  minutes after he was laid in by Hemmings but there was still nothing clear-cut coming for Dundee.On  minutes, Johnson volleyed wide from Todd#s delivery as the Dark Blues sought a late equaliser but it wasn#t to be as they roll on to Queen of the South at Dens next weekend.Inverness XI : RidgersMckay , McCart, Donaldson, Tremarco Trafford Storey, Carson, McHattie, Doran White .Subs not used: MacKay , Harper, Machado, Hyde.Dundee XI : HazardMcGhee , Forster, Meekings , Mackie Byrne , Ness, Dorrans McDaid, McGowanHemmings.Subs not used: Ferrie , McPake, Robertson, Moore.Referee: David Munro.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/SMac_Nightclub_Exterior_Seagate_Dundee-18041701.jpg ","title":"lapdancing plan for old nightclub owned by football chairman in dundee city centre","story":"A city building owned by the chairman of Inverness Caledonian Thistle Football Club could soon host a lapdancing bar.Grant Road Properties Ltd has submitted plans to the council to reopen Industry Nightclub on Seagate as an adult venue for up to  people.The firm behind the application is owned by businessman and Caley Thistle board chairman Ross Morrison – but he denies any direct involvement in the plans. vw, px\"  The application, expected to be reviewed at next month’s meeting of Dundee City Licensing Board, proposes stripping the premises of its nightclub label entirely.Instead, the venue would offer “adult entertainment within core hours”, with no access to children or young people.Mr Morrison said: “We’ve had an offer from somebody to take over the building.“I don’t know how far along the road their plans are. We bought the building about four years ago.“If they don’t open it here they would open it somewhere  – but it is nothing to do with me.“I don’t think anyone could consider me the type to run a lapdancing bar – and I don’t think I would get it past my we, either.”When asked the name of the interested operator, Mr Morrison said he could not recall it.Local residents could be set to object to the plans, claiming a lapdancing bar would “bring down” the area.One local flat owner, who declined to give his name, said: “It’s a family kind of area – this would bring it down.“All that nice Waterfront and the money going in, only to have a strip club in the middle.”The timing of the application may also clash with a consultation on limiting sex venues that Dundee City Council pledged to hold by the end of this year.This was made possible by new Scottish Government legislation which will allow councils to set limits on the number of adult clubs in their local area.The application could end up being discussed at the same meeting as the consultation on whether such proposals can go ahead at all.At the moment, Dundee is home to one lapdancing bar – Private Eyes on Rattray Street – but it is not the first time such a proposal has been floated for the Seagate site.In , an application was submitted for the same purpose by businessman Jimmy Marr at the same venue, when it was known as Stars Sports Bar.A spokesman for the bar said at the time that lapdancing clubs were “no longer seedy-like places where dirty old men go”.Despite council officers recommending the plans for approval, elected members voted them down due to concerns of a rise in antisocial

for the family activity centre have been submitted on behalf of Doncaster-based company, House of Play, which has been manufacturing indoor soft play and indoor soft adventure play equipment for more than  years.The application submitted to the council said: #The proposed development at this location will be theirfirst activity centre of this kind in Dundee.#Their operations could include a mixture of ten pin bowling, trampolining, soft play, indoor golf and ninja run.#House of Play are also considering including activities such as sky fly, snowboarding, neon golf, ropes course and

costs to develop the site for the proposed activity centre were far greater than was first envisaged.#The Dens Road redevelopment has proved to be an impossible project due to the structure, design and service costs drastically increasing.#This is mainly due to the complexities of the structure for this type and height of building.#The funding options became less as the project costs far

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

The anomaly which made this ludicrous was that they were quite willing to cancel the appointment on the say so of the person they did not trust with the time.Have you had the frustration of doing a large supermarket shop early enough to beat the crowd, only to find you can#t add beer, evenit is labelled zero per cent alcohol  I fantasised about a situation where all the alcohol free wine, lager and even gin was made available, tempted people to sample, find jolly good and demand that the ied brands be available in pubs and eating places, instead of the ubiquitous coke.Alas, the alcohol trace in some of  these products mean that all fall foul of government policy.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"harry potter halloween at pony club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHarry Potter was the theme for this year’s Hallowe’en Fun Day organised by Argyll South Pony Club at the Long Walk arena near Kilmartin.Even the judges # Ulla Riddell and Mary Lou Aitchison – got into the spirit of the day by dressing as Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

Itrsquos also a contact point for the council.ldquoThere is also a worry that people arenrsquot going to pop into nearby shops and to use them, itrsquos taking something away from the town centre.ldquoThere is also a big worry in Jedburgh about buildings going out of use. It is situated in a historic building that was purposefully built for the people of Jedburgh as a centre for information.Currently, the council is planning to close the old library, which was first opened in May , when the new intergenerational campus at Hatrigge Park opens in April .The library was built by the Scottish-American steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, who attended the opening ceremony in the town, after an earlier library he had built six years earlier on the high street had proved to be inadequate.Six years ago, Scottish Borders Council voted to integrate its contact centres into the regionrsquos libraries, and since then the council has maintained an outpost in Jedburgh Library, which will also move to the Jedburgh Grammar Campus in April.At the audit and scrutiny meeting, the service director for customers and communities, Jenni Craig, explained that the library will have much longer opening hours at the new campus: ldquoIn relation to accessibility, and the times that the library is open, one of the benefits of moving to the new campus will be the library will be longer.ldquoWe accept that this is a huge change but we also see this as an opportunity.ldquoMembers will be aware that as part of the councilrsquos lsquofit for rsquo transformation programme we are considering how we can deliver services dferently to make the best use of our facilities.ldquoWe have a very challenging financial outlook and we have a five year placen for transforming our services.ldquoIn Jedburgh, the signicant investment in the campus gives us the opportunity to make the most of the facility.After hearing from both sides, councillor Heather Anderson, who represents Tweeddale West, proposed that the matter is formally referred to Ms Craig, and that the service director begins a consultation with the public to address their concerns, from January to March, before the new campus opens in April.The motion was seconded by Galashiels councillor Harry Scott, and the motion was passed, with only Jedburgh councillor Sandy Scott voting against.Speaking after the meeting, petitioner Georgiana Craster said: ldquoIrsquom happy. I was expecting a year long consultation, but you know you ask for bigger and you get lesser, so this is something that we can actually put to the residents.ldquoThere is a lot of sentimentality around the building, and we have to be practical. The school is a wonderful thing, no one is going to say anything against that, but we have to think about everybody, itrsquos not only about educating children itrsquos also about the future of elderly people.ldquoWe donrsquot die immediately, we still continue to live."},{"url":null,"title":"finishing-touches-earlstons-big-christmas-switch-on","story":"VOLUNTEERS have been out in force to

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

Itrsquos getting busy these days, often with families, which is great to see. Even still there is enough space amidst the trees to quickly find solitudeyou need it.I can never visit this wonderful place without whispering a word of thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson for his role, along with others, in saving this precious and magical wood, which my family has almost literally grown up in.I have got to know Gregor, who still lives in East Lothian, and the world is made a better place by caring and thoughtful people like him.We arrived at the wood in late afternoon, knowing that we wouldnrsquot have a lot of time before nightfall. The ground was literally carpeted with orange and yellow, and autumn colours still hung on the trees.But there was a nip in the air a cold crisp reminder that summer is now long gone and the fingers of winter are about to grip us. So we kept on the move to keep warm.As we ventured deeper into the wood I noticed something. ldquoStop, I said to the kids, ldquoand listen.There was not a breath of wind, it was deathly still. The trees stood in absolute silence. I couldnrsquot even hear any traffic, or the usual distant murmurings of modern day le. There was no noise, only the sound of nature.Bird song was above us. I was surprised to hear such a chorus on a late autumn afternoon.We stood, listening. It was asthe birds were suddenly singing for us, and the children were genuinely enthralled, as was I.We decided to continue our walk, but our mood had now changed. The silence could have been eerie but it wasnrsquot, it heightened our awareness that the wood had le we couldnrsquot see.It was asour inner senses had been aroused. The kids wanted to walk silently, so they could continue to listen. So we practised ldquowalking like a Native American hunter as taught to us by Chris Yule, another East Lothian environmental luminary.We crept through the wood, looking for deer, and faeries, now acutely aware of any faint sound that the absence of noise made possible to hear.Finally we reached our favourite place, and sat, still listening. I have to tell you, seeing my two youngest being so quiet for so long was a unique experience.Then it began to get dark, and the bird song faded away.We headed back to the car as the trees turned into shadows. But we still stopped every now and then to listen and peer into the undergrowth. We were convinced at one point we could see a deer hiding from us.We got to the car as the last glimmering light in the sky vanished, and the moon came out from behind the clouds. It was a magical experience, not a scary one. Wersquod had an unexpected connection with nature, that wasnrsquot visual, but something deeper.I turned the engine on, breaking the silence, and we ed to our world of articial light and constant noise. But the whole walk had had a meditative effect on us, and I reflected on the fact that we are replacing sound with noise, and we are the poorer for that.We are so constantly surrounded by human made sounds that we donrsquot notice it. The noise has become the background to our lives. Few of us probably reflect that we need to connect to the sounds of nature anymore, or true silence itself.Our inner selves do however. Call it what you will, our soul, our spiritual self, our primeval awareness. The truth is we need the absence of noise every now and then so the sounds of nature can be heard. It replenishes us, reminds us who we really are, and lts our mental health. No matter how much we pave nature over with cement, we cannot avoid the fact we are part of it and need it.Yet, we are increasingly separated from it, including the sounds and the silence that comes with the absence of our noise. Is there a connection between this and the mental health crisis we now face The neon lights of a shopping centre, and the constant buzz and noise we fill our everyday lives with may seem like progress, but it isnrsquot for our well being. We need places where such noise is absent ndash where only nature is heard. No, actually, we need many more of these places, but sadly we are going in the reverse direction destroying the ones that survive."},{"url":null,"title":"cockenzie-family-return-italian-roots-open-food-lovers-paradise","story":"They have restored the home of their ancestors in Picinisco in Lazio, Italy, and turned it into a holiday destination complete with a boutique hotel, cookery school and winery.Members of the Di Ciacca family moved to Cockenzie  years ago and Cesido Di Ciacca took over The Cockenzie Cafe, a cafe, fish  chip shop and ice-cream shop, in .The family lived above the shop on  High Street and integrated themselves into the community.

The children will also learn about fire safety to keep humans and animals safe.Meghan, from Dunbar, was awarded a posthumous First Class Honours degree from Edinburgh Napier University, where she was studying veterinary nursing, following her death in December .In a statement, her mum and dad said: ldquoWe remember Meghan talking about meeting Lesley and how excited she was about the prospect of being involved with Fostering Compassion. The workshop is such a lovely way to keep Meghanrsquos memory alive.Each Fostering Compassion workshop includes the donation of lsquogts of compassionrsquo from the children to animals in need.Through the Animal Heroes workshops, funds will be raised to donate Smokey Paws oxygen mask kits, used by firefighters to resuscitate animals pulled from fires, to each of the  fire stations in the Lothians, Borders and Fe, which do not yet have them.These gts help encourage compassion and empathy in the children and at the same time, with the blessing of her family, will help keep Meghanrsquos memory alive.Miss Winton added: ldquoMeghan was also a firm believer of lsquorandom acts of kindnessrsquo and created the lsquoWishing Treersquo in Pressmennan Woods in East Lothian where she hung inspirational messages full of hope and love. Both these gestures and activities will be incorporated in the workshop and the children will be encouraged to continue them at home to build on positive behavioural changes as a result of attending the Fostering Compassion activities.ldquoThe idea of the Animal Heroes workshop came to me almost four years ago around the time Meghanrsquos and my paths first crossed and she put me in touch with her father. After her devastating accident, I was determined the workshop would come to fruition, but would be done as a tribute to her.ldquoWe are greatly honoured to have her familyrsquos blessing to do this and thank them very much for their unwavering support.Fostering Compassion runs animal and nature-themed workshops for children in foster care and kinship care. Since starting in  with just  children, nearly  youngsters from throughout Scotland have now benefited from the programme."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-dunbars-new-bear-sculpture-near-a1-unveiled","story":"The renowned Scottish artist created the sculpture in tribute to Dunbar-born John Muir, who went on to play a key role in the formation of the US national park system.The ft sculpture is now sited off the A, near to Dunbarrsquos McDonaldrsquos and Asda.Children from Dunbar Primary School were invited to bring their own bears along to the unveiling of the sculpture todayby Brenda McNeill from Hallhill Developments.The developer has been involved in the construction of more than  houses in the south of the town and the statue has been created through the Percent for Art Scheme, which is a condition of planning consent.The brown bear is symbolic of Muirrsquos travels through the far-off wilderness of Americarsquos west, in the Rockies and Alaska.Like Muir, the bear has travelled from Scotland to America.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him. But for once he was glad of his invisibility. If the manager had ever recognised him outside then John would probably lose his job.ldquoYour costume is in the back room. You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate. The same chocolate bar shersquod chosen with glee in the grotto.ldquoThank you, said John and the girl left with her dad.Johnrsquos old friend was now silent.

The bar has stood on that corner since  and was historically known as The Corona until . In its latter years The Corona bar was hardly a jewel in Shawlandsrsquo crown, with a less than glowing reputation. The news of a takeover by the owners of The Shed who planned to expand their Butterfly and The Pig brand South to Shawlands was widely welcomed news.Fast forward to Autumn  and the venue changed hands once again, this time to a Southside couple with a view to give Shawlands a community bar and kitchen worthy of this historic corner of Shawlands.Southsiders born and bred, the new owners are locals to Shawlands and the bar and restaurant scene. They currently operate a popular city centre live music venue and have both managed and operated venues in and around the Southside most of their working lives.When asked about their newest venture the owners said: ldquoThis is such an iconic building and an integral part of Shawlandsrsquo history so when it came to choosing a name, it could ever only be The Corona. We added Bar  Kitchen because this is not going to be the old Corona pub of the rsquos. itrsquos a place for families and friends to meet, celebrate and relax, a real reflection of Shawlands today. In terms of looking back, the name is merely a nod to the distant past, it wouldnrsquot feel right branding this building with any other name when locally itrsquos still fondly referred to as The Corona.With the bar having big plans for the future with new menus, entertainment and family events, come along to this vibrant, buzzing bar and see for yourself.The Corona Bar  Kitchen Pollokshaws Road, Glasgow, G YFwww.facebook CoronaBarAndKitchen----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Glasgow Music City ToursGlasgows music scene is world famous and, since , Glasgow Music City Tours have helped people explore it with their guided walks.By visiting existing venues and disturbing the ghosts of former performance spaces, the tours tell the story of the artists who have stayed, played and made music in Glasgow, the UKs first UNESCO City of Music.The tours are led by enthusiastic musicians, fans and writers who encourage guests to share their stories of memorable gigs.As well as private tours, Glasgow Music City Tours run three scheduled tours every Saturday from Easter until the end of the season.The Merchant City Music - Past and Present tour tells the tale of the areas major music venues from Barrowland Ballroom to Britannia Panopticon via the City Halls, Old Fruitmarket, Mono and the th Note.Starting at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and ending at King Tuts, the Music Mile tour takes in the sights and sounds of the city centre.

Scottish schools are improving and this international study confirms that.ldquoReading underpins all learning, and the sharp rise in performance is good news.ldquoThe improvement has been driven by great teachers and well-supported pupils, but also our unrelenting focus on improving literacy through the Scottish Attainment Challenge and Pupil Equity Fund. Those efforts are now paying idends, with only five countries scoring higher than Scotland at reading.ldquoThe figures on social background also confirm that we are closing the gap between pupils from the richest and poorest backgrounds.ldquoMaths and science scores are stable at the OECD average, so we need to see the kind of improvement that we now see in literacy in these areas too.

Unlike other forms of green energy, biomass plants produce greenhouse gases. Across the country, the rise in biomass means its total greenhouse gas emissions have nearly reached the amount produced by coal. The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmAssurances that victims of sexual assault will be given equal treatment, whether they live in urban or rural areas, have been welcomed.

Not surprisingly, the prospect of this was enough to put some people off from coming forward in the first place.“Rape Crisis Orkney and others have rightly been highlighting the need to find ways of allowing examinations to take place. To their credit, successive Justice Ministers have responded positively since I first raised concerns with them over two years ago.#Since then, a lot of work has been carried out by ious organisations and iniduals to finding solutions that work for island communities but respect the need for equal access to services.“I, therefore, welcome the Forensic Medical Services Bill and its commitment to equal access across all health boards, including our islands.  The provision of support from the Taskforce to assist with creating and enhancing facilities to allow this to happen is also reassuring.#While some iniduals may still prefer to access services where, for a iety of reasons, what is key is that this is a matter of choice.“Hopefully, NHS Orkney working with local partners will now be able to build on the progress made to date so that we have a robust and sustainable local self-referral service in line with other parts of the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The project was allowed to sell meat until October , and this extension takes advantage of the European Commission’s approval for Scotland-wide sales until any new potential EU exit date.These licences permit the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland directly to consumers as well as to retailers, such as hotels and butchers.Claudia Rowse, SNH’s head of natural resource management said #We are delighted to announce the continued sale of resident greylag goose meat. Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We know that striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, allowing them to control goose numbers sustainably and sell goose meat for profit.”SNH have said they are working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland. A project review will take place in January , in light of the UK’s EU exit arrangements, and take into account any changes arising from the current review of its General Licences.Sale of wild goose meat shot outside the project is prohibited under the Wildle and Countryside Act .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Humans are among the most social animals and are the most intelligent, so it should not have come as a surprise that being cut off from the rest of society can cause distress that is severe enough to affect our health.: New strategy to tackle loneliness launched by Scottish Government: Lonely older people in Glasgow hide feelings to not be a ‘burden’But, four years on from that landmark study, loneliness remains a problem for tens of thousands of Scots, particularly elderly people. According to new research from Age Scotland, one in six of the older generation – that’s about , people – say they often feel more lonely at Christmas than at any other time of year. Nearly , will eat Christmas dinner alone.This is the society we have created and we are the only people who can do something about it. And yet, overshadowed by issues like Brexit, independence, the NHS, schools and a whole raft of other pressing matters, it is too often overlooked in our public discourse.For all these reasons, the Scotsman is today launching a campaign in an attempt to raise the profile of loneliness – in support of Age Scotland and Age UK’s ‘No One Should Have No One’ campaign – and to give a voice to the voiceless.If we think about it, we can all probably do a bit more. We can extend the hand of friendship to relatives and others who we know are lonely. Sometimes it can be dficult or a bit awkward at first, but such feelings will usually dissipate over time. It is not naive to say that the vast majority of people are friendly, decent and kind. Modern living has physically stretched the bonds of family as people have moved hundreds of miles away to find better jobs and this has left many elderly people on their own as family and friends of their own generation have died.But it cannot be beyond our wit to find ways of bringing people togetherthey are feeling isolated and alone. We must do better and not just for the sake of public health but public happiness too.From the NHS website: Five steps to mental wellbeing©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

Yes Kirkcaldy, which was set up before the  referendum, had previously indicated it would back the Scottish Greens candidate’s campaign: SNP withdraws support for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath candidateIn statement, the group said: “We thought Neale Hanvey had dropped out of the race altogether, leaving the Greens’ Scott Rutherford as the only pro-independence candidate.“That turned out not to be the case, and since it became clear that Neale was running as a pro-independence, independent candidate, who still has very strong support, we have come to the conclusion he has the best chance of winning the seat.”A crowdfunding page launched by Mr Hanvey on Saturday to pay for his campaigning costs smashed its target in less than  hours.Speaking today, Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw described the decision by some SNP activists to support the party’s axed candidate as “appalling”.Last week, Mr Hanvey admitted to having shared an article from the Kremlin-backed news agency Sputnik from  concerning the Hungarian financier George Soros, illustrated with an image showing him holding puppets of world leaders.The former Dunfermline councillor made a full apology and later announced his intention to stand as an independent.Yesterday, the SNP’s defence spokesman questioned why some Nationalists were still supporting Mr Hanvey.Responding to one on Twitter who said the antisemitism was a mere allegation, he said: “It’s not ‘alleged antisemitism’, he posted a statement apologising for spreading antisemitism – in this case theories that lead directly to hatred of Jews: comparisons with Nazis and George Soros conspiracies. Why would you swing behind that ”Scott Rutherford, the Greens’ candidate in the seat, said: “I am disappointed that some in Yes Kirkcaldy have ultimately decided that they will not back the only pro-independence party in the constituency at this election. The fact is the SNP suspended Neale Hanvey because of his views. As an inclusive, cross-party movement, independence supporters should be uniting behind the only remaining pro-indy party on the ballot. “The Scottish Greens are already leading on the key issues in this constituency, calling for a just transition at Mossmorran and jobs at BiFab in Burntisland.

The report states an  point gap between the reading scores of the poorest and wealthiest pupils - equivalent to three years schooling - up slightly from  points the last time the tests were carried out. The attainment gap in maths gap has fallen from  to  points in the same period, with science up slightly from  to  points.The random testing of Scottish pupils took place between last October and December and involved  secondary schools across state and private sectors, with a total of  students taking part.It is the seventh time Scotland has taken part in the three-yearly PISA analysis, which shows the mean scores for every country. Reading was at its highest level in  when Scotland scored  compared to todays figure of  - although that is a rise from the  result which saw it hit its lowest point of .In maths, Scotlands high point was in  with a score of , which has now fallen to  in science the high water mark was in  at , with todays figure standing at .Encouraging resultsToday Education Secretary John Swinney welcomed the improvement in reading, and said it was the result of the governments literacy attainment challenge which was introduced in  when the PISA reading score had fallen to . He said that maths and science were also being \"being tackled\".ldquoThese are very encouraging results and the latest sign that our education reforms are working,\" he said. \"Scottish schools are improving and this international study confirms that.ldquoReading underpins all learning, and the sharp rise in performance is good news.\"He said the improvement had been \"driven by great teachers and well-supported pupils\" and the governments \"unrelenting focus on improving literacy through the Scottish Attainment Challenge and Pupil Equity Fund. Those efforts are now paying idends, with only five countries scoring higher than Scotland at reading.\"Despite the figures for maths and science showing steady decline, Mr Swinney described the scores as \"stable\" and at the OECD average. However he added: \"We need to see the kind of improvement that we now see in literacy in these areas too. That is the challenge.ldquoAn inspection of maths and numeracy published by Education Scotland shows what is working and how we can improve. It will help as we move on the next phase of driving up standards in Scotlandrsquos schools.ldquoAnd, in science, good progress has been made with delivery of our five-year STEM strategy, with the roll-out of career-long professional learning grants and new online resources for teachers. The impact of it will only just be beginning to be felt on the ground and we will continue to push for the improvements that we know can be made.ldquoThere is plenty of work still to do to improve Scottish education but todayrsquos report should give people a strong sense that we are on the right track, making substantial progress and seeing results where it counts ndash in the classroom.Failing schools and childrenHowever, the PISA scores were described as proof the government was \"failing schools and children\". Scottish Labourrsquos education spokesperson Iain Gray said: ldquoWhile Nicola Sturgeon tours the TV studios and election debates boasting of her supposed achievements, the reality is that her so-called priority of education continues a slow decline.ldquoThe small improvement in reading is welcome, but further falls in maths and science are alarming. John Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon have been warned again and again that we have a problem with STEM subjects being squeezed out of the curriculum but they refuse to listen. These are the critical skills our next generation need for the jobs of the future.\"He added: \"John Swinney persists with unwanted and unhelpful ldquoreforms like his standardised tests while failing to ensure that our schools have enough resources and enough teachers with enough time and support to do the job we know they can.ldquoThe SNP have abolished most measures of performance in our schools, but they cannot hide from these figures which show they have failed our schools and our children.And Liz Smith, Scottish Conservative education spokesperson, said: ldquoThis is damning evidence revealing the full extent of the SNPrsquos shameful  years running down Scotlandrsquos schools. ldquoNicola Sturgeon asked to be judged on education.

Yet these results are a new low and we know there have been many failings within the delivery of the Curriculum for Excellence.

The event, which also included a family and community fun day, marked the end of a year long refurbishment programme.The work commenced in October, last year when the main contractor Martin Hamilton, a Ballymena based company, arrived on site.Over the course of the next twelve months they completely transformed the inside of the church building as well as adding a new welcome hub.Over the past ten years the congregation has been thinking how best to provide st century facilities for a twenty first century church. Under the guidance of the design team of Kennedy Fitzgerald Architects, Williams  Shaw and Doran Consulting we have been able to take the project forward.The now current minister, Rev William Sinclair was called in September  and ministers along with associate minister Rev Matthew Boyd.First Ballymena Presbyterian Church was one of the first congregations to have an organ installed in the meeting house, and a new digital organ was installed during the current building project. Moving on from here, First Ballymena is a congregation that seeks to have a passion for Jesus Christ and a compassion for people. They want to engage with the community and be a compassionate church with a heart at the heart of the town of Ballymena. The new welcome hub helps open up the church and makes it an inviting place to be.Over the course of the past year, Matthew Boyd has joined William Sinclair in the ministry team and his main role is to strengthen the church’s mission in the community and to develop discipleship programmes in the congregation.Matthew Boyd stated his primary focus is on Discipleship and it has been encouraging to see just how God has been working in a number of people’s lives.Also as a church they have been going “over the wall” and engaging with people outside of the congregation who don’t yet know Jesus. It is the prayer of the church that God might continue to use them to reach out and point others to Jesus.

To be truthful I was in a very dark place. Irsquom not saying I was suicidal but probably close to it. ldquoI was . It was a strange thing. All I wanted to do was stay in the house and lock the door, but still the craving was there for company. Irsquod stand at the window hoping that the people walking past were coming for me.A collection was made of blankets and shoeboxes for SerbialdquoTherersquos a story going around about a person who was so lonely that he would post himself a letter just so the postman would come to the door to deliver it. That is very profound when you get to that stage. I wasnrsquot as bad as that but not far off it.Through Chest, Heart and Stroke, Robert found out about the Age NI club at North Road which ultimately led to his salvation: ldquoI turned up and what I saw actually amazed me ndash  elderly gentlemen discussing everything you can think of from finance to government to football to the shipyards.ldquoThis is exactly what I needed in my le at that time.ldquoThey were all strangers, and quickly became friends.

We still have  members and they are all fairly active and they are all great friends.Some of the participants at Age NI enjoying a game of bingoRobert said: ldquoYou have to take the step, but there is help thereyou do.ldquoAge NI do provide excellent help. Therersquos no doubt about it they go out of their way to encourage you to attend and to interact with other service users.

Itrsquos such a wonderful service that I want to give something back.Robert, who used to work in the meat industry, commented: ldquoWork is important because it gives you a sense of purpose. Age NI gives you that same sense of purpose, a sense of being.You know there are people there willing to help you out.Discussing loneliness he said: ldquoThe loneliness factor is a strange one, you could be at a football match in a crowd of , and still be lonely.ldquoLe is so fast with the younger generation itrsquos hard to blame them for not checking on elderly neighbours.

I married my husband in . He was a cook during the war . We lived in Cyprus for three years and had two children ndash a girl and a boy, Michael and Anthea.ldquoMy dad was in a home and my mum wasnrsquot great by herself as she got older. I had orced and a got a flat in Clarawoodto be near my mum and dad. Now theyrsquore both gone.ldquoAll my aunts and everyone are gone except one cousin who comes to see me every Sunday and takes me shopping. My ex-husband is dead and my children, who live in Peterborough, come to see me every summer.ldquoWhen I broke my leg and was in hospital for six weeks I had to find somewhere  to live that was better suited to my mobility.Mabel, who now lives in secure accommodation for older people in east Belfast, said: ldquoHalf of the place is residents who canrsquot get out at all.ldquoIrsquom able to get out with my trolleyI order a taxi. Once a week I get picked up in the minibus and taken here. Irsquom the first on the bus.ldquoI really look forward to it, everybody is so good and nice. The people here feel like family. ldquoThe rest of the week gets very lonely. I watch TV but itrsquos not the same as talking with real people.ldquoItrsquos important to encourage people to take that first step out of the house, therersquos always help at the end of it.Wendy is head of a very happy familyAge NIrsquos day centre at the Skainos Centre is run by Wendy McKillion who is in the strange position of being lsquohead of the familyrsquo despite being younger than all of the people she cares for. The -year-old said: ldquoIt all starts when I have a referral from social services. I leave the centre to pay a home visit to assess the older people who really need to get out of the house, the people who are really isolated.ldquoIt is nice being in the position to offer somebody a social day at the centre ndash their lestyle improves as soon as they set foot through the door.ldquoTheyrsquore having a three-course home-cooked meal from our cook that we have on site. Jeanrsquos been with us for  years.ldquoBasically here at the centre the staff provide a good social day for service users. If theyrsquore having a good day wersquore having a good day.ldquoI have an open door policy that anyone at any time can come and have a private chat with me. They all have my mobile, they can get me any time and believe you me they do.ldquoItrsquos good security for them. If someone hasnrsquot turned up Irsquoll try to ring them or ring their next of kin, then go round and check on them.ldquoThey feel like my family. Some people only come in one day, some come in two, some come in three. It depends on inidual needs.ldquoIrsquove been looking after older people from I was in my twenties. It doesnrsquot get any easier when they pass away.Wendy, whose twin sister Gilly also works for Age NI, is full time with the organisation while many others lend their support on a voluntary basis:ldquoThe volunteers are worth their weight in gold. They could be semi-retired, they could be students, they could be people like Robert . All the time they give is appreciated.Recently Age NI teamed up with Blythswood Care to put together a relief package containing  blankets and  shoeboxes to be sent to Serbia.The group has had its share of celebrity mums with both Van Morrison and Dan Gordonrsquos mother attending.Proof that you donrsquot have to be alone to suffer from lonelinessLucy Quinn is proof that it is still possible to be lonely even when you come from a very large family.The east Belfast woman has eight children,  grandchildren and  great grandchildren.She said: ldquoI see my family very regularly but therersquos some days Irsquom just sitting in the house on my own. I bought myself a recliner chair and Irsquove got aframe to help me when I need to get up.ldquoIrsquod read magazines and do crosswords books to put the time in. I buy them to keep my brain active. Irsquod watch some TV as well.She said: ldquoI originally came from down by the shipyards. My father worked there and my brothers-in-law.ldquoMy husband died  years ago. He died aged  and one of my sons also died aged .ldquoItrsquos heartbreaking when you lose people who are very close to you.She commented: ldquoIt seems strange to say I get lonely when Irsquove got such a big family but loneliness isnrsquot straightforward.Lucy, who lives with her youngest daughter Karen, said: ldquoOne night Irsquoll have sevenin, sometimes there can be  or  of them in. You never know until they press the buzzer who will be coming.ldquoI have  grandchildren and great grandchildren.

That was the start of it.ldquoIrsquom disabled, but not as much then as I am now.ldquoI love coming here. I come one day a week.

Set in an old theatre in the s, the former St Genevieve’s pupil’s take on the festive and timeless classic will take families of all ages through a journey as they watch all the characters come together to show Ebenezer Scrooge the error of his ways.“The MAC’s Christmas audience is quite young so to introduce three ghosts can become quite scary so you have to work with that,” she said. “They always say write what you know and I know the theatre. I’ve set the story in a theatre where Scrooge is a producer, along with Jacob Marley they were the big theatre producers of the day. There is a term in threatre called the ‘ghost light’ this would have been turned on through the night so that people, who were still working through, wouldn’t have fallen through the trapdoor. I loved that idea and thought this would work as a way to introduce our ghosts. “This theatre, which Scrooge is in charge of, isn’t making the profit it used to the ghosts come to le in the hope that Scrooge won’t close down the theatre. The kids who will be in the audience are helping us create this story and it’s a way to introduce such a classic to a younger audience,” she said. Having starred in panto since she was , Tara Lynne will also be starring in Xmas For Dummies at the Grand Opera House with Chris Robinson, “an adult take on the classic ’s film Mannequin,” set in Castle Street.“It’s an hour of a show, either before or after your Christmas party to come in and have a laugh with us. I’m only in one of them so you’ll not be sick of my face,” she laughed.Having wowed audiences with her Shirley Valentine at The Lyric stage earlier this year, Tara Lynne exclusively reveals that her one-woman tour de force is coming back in  for a new run. “I’m really excited to be coming back with the show. The amount of feedback we got from people for a -year-old play was amazing. Everybody was coming up to me saying how they had ‘got a bit of Shirley in me’.“You could’ve heard a pin drop most nights in The Lyric. The support for the piece was unbelievable, it is such a gt of a show.”When not writing, acting or preparing to travel to ‘Greece for a fortnight’, Tara Lynne will be donning ‘Ma’s’ wig again as filming for Derry Girls series three gets underway in April.“I can’t wait to see what Lisa has instore for this series, I don’t think anyone can wait. It’s all very top secret at the minute. The scripts are so good, let’s hope I don’t get killed off or leave in a black taxi as that’s what happened me in Eastenders,” she laughed.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":null,"title":"dissidents santa with rifle image condemned by the psni","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The SDLP were out in force on the ground in the Lower Ormeau and the Markets this week.SDLP’s Claire HannaAs her partys most high-profile MLA on broadcast media, and with personal and family links to the constituency dating back decades, Hanna has a strong hand generally.She is also fortunate in her main unionist opponent. In neighbouring East Belfast, DUP MP Gavin Robinson has kept a relatively low-profile. He hasnt antagonised those who didnt vote for him.The same cannot be said of Little-Pengelly in South Belfast. When she was elected, she had the opportunity to build bridges with nationalists and others in this most erse constituency - as an act of self-preservationnothing .DUP’s Emma Little-PengellyInstead, she became involved in rows over bonfires and UVF flags. It was unwise to antagonise those who otherwise might have developed a civil relationship with a reconciliatory and progressive DUP MP.Yet Little-Pengelly certainly cant be written off in next months poll. She has a fine electoral track record in this constituency. She increased her partys vote by an impressive % between  and , something for which she is given insufficient credit.She is a prodigious constituency worker. Despite Ulster Unionist Michael Henderson standing, she should secure a massive unionist vote.DUP Balmoral councillor David Graham is running her campaign, and doesnt think it is a lost cause.\"Emma got over , votes last time, and there is room for growth in our core area,\" he says.\"If you compare our  bestboxes in the constituency with the top  nationalist boxes in  - when we did exceptionally well - there was still a far higher proportion of people in our best areas who didnt vote or werent even registered.\"Weve done a lot of work on the ground to change that, and unionist voters are very motivated for this election. Emma grew unionist turnout in , and we need to do that again. I think we will as people realise it has never been more important to defend the Union.\"Graham also cites the outgoing MPs grassroots endeavours: \"Emma has dealt with over , cases in her office in her two years as an MP. Christopher Stalford is a hard-working MLA and we have an excellent council team locally. That helps us hugely.\"Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw The key to the DUPs chances is how Alliance fares. If the Remain camp is fairly evenly split and Hanna doesnt pull signicantly ahead of Bradshaw, then Little-Pengelly should win.Support for Bradshaw next month is dficult to predict. The SDLP was , votes ahead of Alliance in . Yet the Naomi factor and the partys extraordinary success in the EU election may have changed the dynamic.Alliance surged ahead of the SDLP in Mays council poll. But the fact Bradshaw stood as an Ulster Unionist Conservative candidate in  might limit her reach more than it would an Alliance candidate without such a history.Ray Kennedy was the SDLPs election guru in South Belfast for two decades. He ran Alasdair McDonnells campaigns. He says: \"This seat is now Claire Hannas to lose. But I think it will be tight at the top with the SDLP just edging it over the DUP, and Alliance coming a good third.\"Alasdair won around , soft unionist votes in . I reckon theyre in doubt, with these voters perhaps switching to Alliance or staying at home.\"The SDLPs perceived pact with Sinn Fein doesnt help as its being sold by others as a sectarian pact.\"However, Kennedy sees Hanna winning support where. \"Claire wont get % of the Green vote, but she will get a fair chunk. But I think she will secure no more than half Sinn Fein votes, and perhaps only a third,\" he says.\"The benchmark will be whether she manages to get as high a turnout as Alasdair in and the SDLP won over , votes.\"While forecasting defeat for Alliance this time, Kennedy predicts future growth.\"Alliance did very well in the council election, but the archaic and undemocratic first-past-the-post system for Westminster doesnt suit the party,\" he says.\"I see it occupying the same space in South Belfast as we did  years ago. Alasdair ran for Westminster and wasnt close, but he made up ground in every election and we used that momentum to grow our vote. Alliance will do similarly. It has bright prospects ahead.\""},{"url":null,"title":"constituency profile ian paisley certain to weather the storm in north antrims staunch dup country","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In response, we immediately suspended human review of Siri audio requests, reviewed our practices and policies and released improvements to Siri’s privacy protections,” he said.These include no longer retaining audio recordings of Siri interactions by default and a facility to delete Siri history.Google’s public policy manager Ryan Meade said that the company does not and did not retain audio recordings from Google Assistant by default.“We do not store users’ data unless they choose to opt in. Opting in helps the Assistant better recognise a users’ voice over time, and also helps improve the Assistant for everyone by allowing us to use audio to understand more languages and accents,” he said.“We are automatically deleting more audio data. One of the principles we strive toward is minimising the amount of data we store, and we’re applying this to the Google Assistant as well. We’re also updating our policy to vastly reduce the amount of audio data we store.”"},{"url":null,"title":"charitable vending machines open in london","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Chair of DTUC, Niall McCarroll, has taken the opportunity to extend an invitation to citizens throughout the city. Niall McCarroll DTUC Chairperson says: DTUC invites all citizens to come along to our Workers Hustings event, a hustings which will provide an opportunity to show solidarity with those workers currently taking strike action and to engage in a question and answer session with the candidates standing in the upcoming Foyle constituency Westminster elections.Conveniently, the narrative for this election is that the British withdrawal from the EU is the main issue in which people should focus and vote accordingly. The establishment political classes systematically set the narrative, attempting to dictate and control. This hustings will give people, and specically workers the opportunity to discuss the real matters at hand. Matters such as cuts to health, education and the diminishing right to social equality and le chances, through poverty pay and the relentless attacks on terms and conditions of employment.The narrative at the DTUC hustings will be set by workers including teachers, classroom assistants, civil servants, Community and Voluntary Sector workers, youth workers, hotel workers, nurses, and Health and Social Care workers, everyone is welcome.DTUC send out a message of solidarity to all those workers struggling under a system which values only the system. A solution needs to be found through a determined revolt, inspired by a trade union movement workers led revolution.The accessibility of liberty, free from oppressive restrictions would seem to have been achieved for all, but is this the case  When a child goes to school hungry, to a school unable toeffectively due to a lack of resources, where is the ownership of that childs le  Health and Social Care services are collapsing but so too is society, collapsing under the rule of capitalist governments, depriving working class communities of true liberty and opportunity.Working class communities deserve better, workers deserve equality, now more than ever we need to organise and mobilise, a class war is raging and key battles lie ahead. This is what this election should be about, fighting back and electing those who will stand up to the establishment, breaking the mould, not just becoming part of the establishment when elected.Workers and their families need both political leadership and solidarity. The DTUC Workers Hustings will provide the Foyle constituency candidates with an opportunity to listen to workers and detail why a vote for them is a vote to fight, a vote worth giving.Out of the seven Foyle candidates, four have confirmed attendance, Anne McCloskey , Colum Eastwood , Elisha McCallionand Shaun Harkin .Darren Guy , Gary Middleton , and Rachael Fergusonall said they had made prior arrangements and therefore couldnt attend. googletag.cmd.push The DTUC Workers Hustings will take place at UNISON Hall, Clarendon Street, Derry, on December  at pm. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

So, what is the connection between Hippocrates the father of medicine, an ancient oriental tree, a Greek born medical consultant and the section of Derry’s Walls that the terraced houses of Nailors’ Row once nestled under  Every week, hundreds, maybe thousands of us, walk through historic Bishop’s Gate to and from the city centre. But how many of us pay more than a cursory glance to the beautul patch of sculpted greenery that lies on the right-hand side of the road just outside the walled city  googletag.cmd.push In your mind you may have fleetingly admired its prettiness and thought it a vast improvement on the strip of plain grass that used be there. Just around the corner from the end of the garden, it gives way to steep green slopes that roll downwards the Bogside. It is a site that has seen its fair share of trouble over the decades standing as it does right on the boundary between the Fountain and the Bogside. The at times, serious sectarian clashes there have seen it labelled with one of those cold and condemnatory Northern Ireland terms – interface. However, since November  that small piece of land right in the middle of the often wrongly maligned trouble spot has stood as a quiet beacon to something that should truly uny us all – the gt of good health. googletag.cmd.push It is known as the New Le Garden and is a place of reflection for those who have been given a second crack at existence through organ donation. Whilst the garden is dedicated to all those who have both received and given all transplantable organs either as living donors or through donation after death, a local group based at the city’s hospital has championed the garden and the spirit in which it was created. The words on a stone monument in the heart of the garden erected by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group state: “This Garden of Le celebrates the gt of new le through organ donation and gives thanks to all organ donors, both living and deceased, for their tremendous generosity and empathy in providing new le through their selfless sacrice.” When the garden was opened six years ago, the official ceremony was attended by representatives of all the city’s main churches, the Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, the Fountain and Bogside communities, residents of nearby Alexander House and many people from the then Derry City Council who backed the project. The commemorative garden was also integrated with St Columba’s Peace Garden which occupies the same space. On a chosen Sunday each Christmas time since , as people with arms weighed down with shopping bags in preparation for the festive period hurry by, a group of people gather at the garden to do what it says on the monument – give thanks and remember. The annual ceremony isn’t one that pays attention to either pomp or circumstance. Instead, it’s conducted quietly and reverently, consisting mainly of a few meaningful, heartfelt words by someone who has faced the crushing ordeal of facing leaving le before the inexpressible and joyous relief of having it prolonged by those who have been kind and brave enough to donate. Prayers and a few well-chosen hymns and songs only add to the poignancy of the occasion. With each passing year some of the faces are no longer there, but their families are. New faces are also there – new because they have been added to the list awaiting a new kidney, a new heart, liver or lung. Those who already have done or are waiting to provide a new lease of le are also there, as are the families of those who by their passing handed on extended le to many others. The garden is also where those awaiting a transplant can visit and gain strength. What however, has that got to do with Hippocrates, an ancient oriental tree and specialist medic from modern Greece  The Plane Tree of Kos, or the Tree of Hippocrates according to legend, is the place where in ancient Greece the father of medicine taught his students. The current -foot high tree in the centre of Kos is only around  years old but is believed to be a descendant of the original tree which stood there over two and a half thousand years ago. Seeds or cuttings from the tree have been transported all over the world and one will soon be planted at the New Le Garden in Derry. It will not be the first time a cutting of the famed tree has been placed in Northern Ireland. The practice was first initiated by an intriguing doctor who landed on these shores in the s and who sadly passed away in . Dr Dimitrios Oreopoulous was born in Alexandroupolis and was one of five brothers who grew up in impoverished circumstances. However, he managed to get admitted to the medical school at the University of Athens and received his specialist certicate in . He then moved to the City Hospital in Belfast as a renal registrar where he completed his PhD in nephrology. Upon completion of his studies in Belfast Dr Oreopoulous was recruited by the Toronto Western Hospital where he continued his research at the Metabolic Renal Unit. It was in  whilst studying at Queen’s that the Greek medic presented seeds from the Plane Tree of Kos to both the university and Erskine House at the City Hospital where it continues to thrive to this day. In fact, in , the Erskine House Tree was nominated and won the Woodland Trust’s Tree of the Year competition. In turn, Dr James Douglas, former consultant Nephrologist at Belfast City Hospital, took several cuttings from the Erskine House Tree and these have now matured into saplings ready to be transferred to the New Le Gardens across Northern Ireland. Outside of Derry, other gardens can be found at Kiltonga in Newtonards and at Botanic Gardens in Belfast next door to Queen’s University. Patron of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients, Eamonn Holmes said of the tree at Belfast City Hospital being named tree of the year: “The Erskine House Tree means many things to many dferent people throughout the world, especially the transplant family. I am delighted that the tree has received prestigious accolade and will forever remain a symbol of the ‘Gt of Le’ and a representation of our brave organ donors.” According to the Department of Health, around  people are waiting for an organ transplant, and sadly, around  people die each year while on the waiting list. If you want to add your name to the NHS Organ Donor Register you can either register online at the Organ Donation NI website at https:www.organdonationni.info  or telephone    . A lesser known option is the possibility of becoming a living donor and the most common type in this respect is kidney donation. This takes place when one kidney is removed from a healthy person and transplanted into someone , often a relative. Quite rightly, the NHS point out that this is a major decision to make and everyone who comes forward undergoes a thorough assessment. All live donors and recipients are reviewed by an independent assessor who makes sure there is no pressure or coercion involved and that all parties understand the risks of complications. To make the distinction, the Organ Donor Register is only for those who wish to donate after death – to become a living donor, you must contact a transplant centre directly. The Living Donation Kidney Transplant Team can be contacted at Belfast City Hospital also on    . The team have also released a strategy paper on live kidney donation which can be viewed at https:www.odt.nhs.uk odt-structures-and-standards key-strategies living-donor-transplantation-strategy- . The annual service of remembrance organised by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group, including the planting of the Plane tree sapling, takes place this year on Sunday, December  at the New Le Garden, Nailors Row at pm.

A “winter pressures” media briefing took place at Altnagelvin today where Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Services, Mark Gillespie, Assistant Director of Acute Services and Brendan Lavery, Lead Consultant in Emergency Medicine, outlined measures being taken ahead of the busy winter period. AE attendees at the Derry hospital have risen year on year since , in the past year alone by .% or , people, making clear the case for an expanded Emergency Department . Unusually, there has been no lull in numbers since July and the emergency department has come under sustained pressure. googletag.cmd.push Traditionally Altnagelvin ED treated around , attendees but that has surged over the past five years. The department was built to hold - patients at a time, one night last week there were  patients in attendance, and the figure regularly sits around -. The current facilities were not built to cope with the almost , patients now flowing through its doors each year, that figure is expected to rise to around , next year. The Derry News recently reported that the business case for AE expansion at Altnagelvin has reached its “final stages”.It would accommodate an anticipated , annual attendees. However, it requires funding approval and ministerial sign-off and delivery is likely to take a number of years. googletag.cmd.push Pharmacy staff are taking strike action today, December , and Wednesday, December . Industrial action will put additional pressure on services throughout December, with Royal College of Nursing members taking action short of strike on December  and again on December  , then full strike action on December . “That is being managed on a daily basis and a contingency plan is in place,” Ms McKay said. She added that there has been “no additional investment” this year to deal with winter pressures from the department or health and social care board. The majority of patients attending are doing so for category   health care which is deemed “immediate very urgent”. A newly published Department of Health report shows that in September a .% of patients arriving at Altnagelvin’s Emergency Department required treatment for “immediate” and “very urgent” health care. That is signicantly higher than any other emergency department in Northern Ireland with, for example, the Royal Victoria Hospital treating .% of patients in the same categories. Ms McKay said the Trust’s priority is to “make sure patient care is safe and therefore whatever we need, evenpatients have to remain in the emergency department, we’ll make sure we have enough nurses to look after them and take care of them, and enough doctors to see and treat them in a timely manner. Irrespective of anything  that is our focus.” See Thursdays edition of the Derry News for full coverage.

Laura Kelly took part in a special session with Lisa Lavery, who has twenty years’ experience in the industry, through the ScreenWorks programme which offers specialist training sessions. Like all ScreenWorks sessions, the Costume Design programme gave students a real insight into what it’s like to work in the industry. The young people taking part visited the Ulster Museum to see real period costumes andwas able to create a mask to their own design. The aim was to allow the young people to explore their creativity and gain a good understanding of the job. googletag.cmd.push “The industry has changed massively from when I started, said Lisa. There was so little work then but there’s been an explosion of opportunity here in Northern Ireland and it’s so important that we share our skills with young people. It took me a long time to learn the nuances of the job and I think it’s essential to share what I learned with people like Laura,” she said. Since the programme started in ,  young people have benefitted from the teaching and guidance of highly successful industry professionals. In , there are  more sessions available in a range of topics such as production accountancy, location scouting, catering, hair and make-up and animation. googletag.cmd.push The aim is to help students explore career options, develop skills that will help them in their careers and courses and to continue to build a highly skilled talent pool to benefit the industry. Sean Boyle from Into Film explained that the courses are a great opportunity for young people to learn tips and techniques from professionals in the industry. He said: “There are so many dferent jobs available in these industries but often young people and their teachers and parents aren’t aware of the opportunities available right here in Northern Ireland.” There are several ScreenWorks sessions coming up in Derry.

The likes of Martin Roddy, Andy Russell, Paul Deery and Tony Fleming, to mention a few. These guys taught me a lot as I came up through the ranks and I will be forever thankful to them.‘The Fire Service is one big family and everyone had each other’s back. I worked with a great bunch of lads at both fire stations and had many happy years in Red Watch.’Jim said he hoped to take a few months off and relax and take in a few foreign holidays, adding he would miss the Service and intends to keep in touch with his former colleagues.“I will miss the boys, of course, and it will take a bit of getting used to.”Reminiscing on some of the more “hairy” shouts he took part in over the years, he continued: “I remember the serious trouble that kicked off in the city over the Drumcree situation a few years ago. We were in the middle trying to put a fire out with petrol and blast bombs coming from one side and plastic bullets from the other.“A notable event was three rescues in a -minute period late one night. We pulled people from a building in Nicholson Square, minutes later more at Duncreggan Road before rushing to Shantallow’s Ardnamoyle Park for another. I think it was  people in the three shouts. Never known it to happen before and hope it never happens again. And on a lighter side, he recalled working on night sht and getting a call to a car fire in Foyle Street car park.Jim recalled: “We got out of the appliance and the car was well alight. I was putting water onto the fire and I said to my mate that car looks like mine. I went around to the front and checked the number plate - it was mine! “Margaret, my we, had been up at St Columb’s Hall at choir practice. No sympathy from the boys either. When we went back to the station they were trying to sell me hot cars and asbestos seat covers.”The popular firefighter was well supported at Thursday night’s presentation with over  firefighters in attendance at the Bishop’s Gate Hotel with many speeches praising Jim and wishing him a long and happy retirement.And what does the future hold for Jim  He said: “After a few holidays I hope to carry out some voluntary work with local dementia groups. My late mother suffered from the disease and it would be nice to give something back in her memory.’ googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The property also benefits from an integral garage.A key feature of the island is the direct road access to the mainland via Castle Island Road and onto Strangford Road which connects Strangford with Downpatrick.The new owners will share the island with Quoile Yacht Club, which offers some of the finest facilities in Strangford Lough, and the Quoile Pondage Nature Reserve and Bird Hide.The enclosed garden and grounds at the house extend to . acres and slope from the house to Castle Island Road and include manicured lawns and mature trees which provide shelter and amenity. There is also a small gravel area next to the house with trees and shrubs.An extensive block of farmland lies within a perimeter fence and is well suited for the grazing of livestock and production of silage hay.Estate agents Osborne King say that while nestled in private surroundings, the island conveniently lies a short distance from several towns including Downpatrick.While there is an abundance of amenities on the island including wildle, and sporting opportunities, there are also plenty of interest points nearby, including Castle Ward and Delamont Country Park.Gavin Clarke, from Osborne King, says the property has been on the market for over a week and is already generating interest from potential buyers.ldquoThis delightful property would make an ideal second home or, alternatively, a main family residence, given its tranquil location and magnicent views, with the Mournes to one side and Strangford on the other, he said.ldquoThe current owners have lived there for around  years and while they are very sorry to see it go, they look forward to seeing others benefit from it. The bungalow is ready to walk into as it has been well maintained down through the years.Gavin added: ldquoWith a couple of viewings in the pipeline, it would be nice to sell this side of Christmas.Further information is available from the Osborne King office, Donegal Square South, Belfast on    or email property@osborneking..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Businesswoman.jpg","title":"Businesswomen mentor Assumption students  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH students have taken part in their first management programme that promotes womenrsquos capacity for leadership.Over  sixth form girls at Assumption Grammar School spent the day recently shadowing female leaders in a range of industries including financial services, recruitment, law, media, construction and health, last month.SistersIN Female Leadership Programme, was launched this year to help foster girlsrsquo confidence in leadership roles.Organisers say it gave those taking part an opportunity to work alongside a female mentor at CEO, director or partner level across several trades in which women continue to be underrepresented at the top.Projects and communications assistant Hannah Magorrian said: ldquoAfter spending the day with mentors, the students develop their leadership skills in school, leading initiatives including mental health, peer mentoring, photography, sport, music, drama, debating, literacy, creative writing, religion and coding.ldquoThe school hopes these pupil-led initiatives will provide a legacy that benefits the whole school and wider community.ldquoIn line with the ethos at the heart of Assumption Grammar School, the pupils have already spent time with female leaders in local charities.She continued: ldquoThe school is currently working with its sister Assumption schools in South Africa to develop a parallel initiative with the aim of empowering African girls to become future leaders.ldquoThis global aspect of the SistersIN programme is reaching out to a country where females are vastly underrepresented at senior management and executive levels.The SistersIN Female Leadership Programme is being piloted in Assumption Grammar School this year, in association with Women in Business.Pupils will have two further leadership experience days, working with female leaders, on February  and June  when they will gain a dferent experience of leadership from one of over  partner industries..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Celebration.jpg","title":"Celebration time for Aughlisnafin  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN GAC held their annual presentations and dinner in the Burrendale Hotel last Saturday evening with Armagh and Crossmaglen Rangers legend Oisin McConville as the special guest.Major awards were as follows: seniors mdash managerrsquos player of the year, Donagh Steele managerrsquos sportsperson, Sean Fitzsimmons playersrsquo player, Donagh Steele.Minors mdash managerrsquos player, Morgan Croskery managerrsquos sportsperson, Peter OrsquoHare playersrsquo player, Ben Ogle.Senior players Oran Flanagan and Oisin OrsquoToole, received a commemorative league winners shield, on behalf of the squad, which has the names of every player and the management team engraved on it.The senior  and management team were also presented with league and championship medals and the minors were presented with their All County league medals.There were two recipients of the club person of the year award mdash chairperson Sheena Murray in recognition of an outstanding first term in her role and also Gerard Lenaghan in his role as coaching officer and PRO.The final award of the evening was presented to club vice-chairperson and senior player Rory Murphy in recognition of his outstanding contribution over the past  years.Oisin McConville was then invited to say a few words and spoke well with excellent advice for the future and encouraging rank and file members to put their shoulders to the wheel.There is much to do in a growing club and help is vital to sustain the clubrsquos development.

Many from Kilmegan and the surrounding areas tragically paid the ultimate price on a foreign field and are remembered in the book.Chapters on the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, the Troubles, the loyalist and IRA ceasefires and the Good Friday Agreement take the history of the parish into the modern age.Hundreds of hours of painstaking work researching historical documents and the archives of local newspapers, including those of the Down Recorder, were involved in the production of this book which will undoubtedly be regarded as an important point of reference for current and future generations.In a typically noble and generous gesture the Kilmegan and Maghera Historical Group have decided proceeds from the sale of the book will go to the Childrenrsquos Heartbeat Trust.Copies are now on sale at Walkersrsquo newsagents and JRrsquos Discount Stores, Castlewellan, with details of further points of sale on the Grouprsquos Facebook page, Kilmegan Maghera..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Jasmine.jpg","title":"Jasmine\u0027s first Christmas without a home  ","story":"JASMINE Carbery is one of the many unseen homeless people in Northern Ireland.She looks like any other young woman you may notice walking along Market Street in Downpatrick mdash bright, full of le and full of chat.Yet, at the young age of , she will spend Christmas at the Simon Community house in Saul Street away from her family for the first time.She moved into Saul Street in August after staying in the Newry Simon Community hostel a few months before that.Jasmine is one of three young women living in the Saul Street house. So far she is doing well and enjoying her new le in Downpatrick.Jasmine was asked her to leave her home earlier this year. Her parents have not been in her le for some time.ldquoLiving in Downpatrick is alright.

I was working but then I needed to have some serious surgery on the back of my neck and I wasnrsquot able to work. Thatrsquos what led to the breakdown and I was asked to leave.What Jasmine says next is said in a calm, non-emotive manner.ldquoBecause I hadnrsquot been working, I didnrsquot have much money to contribute to the house. Also because I have two rare medical conditions, I had been on preion painkillers for them for over a year now. Irsquom actually addicted to them.

When I became homeless, I started taking drugs, mainly cocaine and tablets, as they were all around me.ldquoI suppose itrsquos a bit of an escape as well as many people see homelessness as rock bottom. But the prescription painkiller addiction would be my biggest problem and I suffer really badly with my mental health.Jasmine relationship with her relatives is still fragile, although there has been some infrequent communication between them.Living in a hostel has had some high and low points for her.ldquoSimon Community hostels are used as bail hostels but they are not exclusive to just prisoners, she said. ldquoI have never been in jail, never been arrested and would be classed as a vulnerable person.ldquoYou donrsquot really know who you are living with in a hostel as therersquos all sorts of people. That makes you more apprehensive.ldquoMy experience is that there have been predominantly male residents in the two hostels I have lived in. I was the only girl in about - fellas in the Newry hostelrsquos main building, so that took a bit of getting used to and was quite scary. Here is smaller, so itrsquos not as bad.ldquoBut the staff are amazing here. They go above and beyond their job description for you.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

From a legal perspective, my best advice to anyone thinking of going on holiday next summer, is to take out a travel insurance policy as soon as possible. Your insurance policy might cover you all year round until the time of your holiday, which means you could be covered for a number of dferent situations – for exampleyou’re ill before your holiday and have to cancel it.”Make sure the travel insurance is bespoke to you and your needs“It’s definitely worth taking out a cheaper policy than none at all, however, we do advise that you go a step further and opt for a bespoke policyyou can afford to. As this will ensure your policy is bespoke to you and your needs as an inidual. Many people tend to get reeled in by the cheap travel insurance deals – but think to yourself, what do I need cover for  Is this policy going to be suitable for me and my family ”Book a package holiday“Over the last decade or so, we’ve seen a signicant rise in people booking holidays that aren’t package holidays – people tend to be shopping around more booking flights  hotels  transfers separately, in order to cut down cost. However, we are advising consumers to rethink this strategy, and consider booking holidays as a package deal. It’s important to understand the dficulty you may run intosomething were to go wrong, and you’ve booked each component separately. For example,you’ve paid £ for your flights with a particular airline, and paid £ with a separate hotel provider –your flight was cancelled, you may or may not get your £ back from that airline . However, there is no guarantee that you’ll get your refund on the hotel too, as this is a separate and standalone contract. Again, this may or may not be covered on your insurance policy, but you’re not going to get it back from the hotel provider regardless.“If you choose to book a package holiday, with a reputable tour operator,one part goes wrong, all components are likely to be covered. The law in this area changed only recently and the new Package Travel Directive is an even more powerful piece of pro-consumer legislation. The importance of booking a genuine package holiday cannot be underestimated, and again this is even more relevant in light of Brexit and its uncertainties.”Make sure there is ATOL Protection on your holiday“ATOL protection is extremely important, and goes hand-in-hand with booking a package holiday. For example,an airline stops trading, there is a back up fund which acts as a ‘safety net’ it ensures that you canhomeyou’re stranded abroad and that your money is safe.”Pay for your holiday by credit card“Don’t lose sight of booking your package, ATOL protected holiday, by credit card. If your holiday is over the value of £, and something were to go wrong – under the Consumer Credit Act, the credit card company provides another avenue for financial redress, providing even more financial protectionthings go wrong.\"Email your Brexit-related questions to gemma.jimmison@jpimedia.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"wine drinkers could be seeing red over brexit price rises ","story":"NI pizza restaurant to create  new jobsNI community unites to paint Christmas images over dissident republican muralsNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsWine drinkers could be seeing red over Brexit price risesNever mind borders or backstops - the most recent bad news to come out of Brexit has shown that the price of wine could go up.By Charlotte HardingTuesday, rd December , : pm\"Wine prices could go up after BrexitThe Journal of Wine Economics featured an industry study that says that the amount customers pay could increase by up to  per cent by  in the event of a hard Brexit, or  per cent in terms of a softer Brexit.According to a report by WSTA, the Wine and Spirit Trade Association,  percent of wine drunk in the UK is imported. Of this half is produced in the EU, while the remainder comes from Australia, USA, Chile, Argentina, South Africa and New Zealand. There are concerns thatthe right measures are not put in place it could stop imports from crossing the border, which has lead some retailers to stock up on bottles in advance.British vineyards could benefit however.The WSTA has been advising members for more than a year that they should increase their stock by  per cent as a starting point in case of a no deal Brexit.Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said: “Since the Referendum, the WSTA has campaigned consistently for a deal with the EU that delivers frictionless trade in goods, with no additional tarfs or costs.“If the UK ends up with a no-deal Brexit then wine businesses will have to cope with additional tarfs as well as another duty rise - which is highly likely to end up full square in the consumer’s lap, bumping up wine prices to an all-time high.“Currently there are no tarfs on wines from the EU, Chile and South Africa. A no deal Brexit would result in the introduction of tarfs, estimated to cost UK wine importing businesses over £ million a year.“The introduction of no deal Brexit tarfs would be a double blow for wine businesses after the Chancellor elected to single out wine for a duty rise at the Autumn Budget.”From February  the duty on a bottle of wine went up by p, but add a tarf to the duty rise and VAT and this means an average priced bottle of wine, which today costs £., will cost £. in the event of no deal.Read More Read MoreTheres just  days to go - will Brexit affect your travel plans  This is an extra p a bottle more than consumers paid before the referendum result when an average priced bottle of wine was £..There could be some positive benefits for British vineyards however.It is believed that British wines will seem less expensive than its European counterparts as retailers won’t be forced to hike prices because of rate or tarfs.However, British vineyards could be hit with the lack of skilled workers from the EU and vital agricultural funding streams. The WSTA also wants confirmation that funding that was before provided by the EU will be picked up somewhere .Tamara Roberts, CEO at Ridgeview in East Sussex, said: “As we prepare for Brexit, it will be critical that the government does all it can to help English wine grow and that includes continued access to funding streams.“Complete confidence in the quality of our wines has allowed us to expand production but so has access to funding streams, some of which derive from EU structural funds.”At the moment, while the future is uncertain as to what will happen with Brexit come March , it may be worthwhile buying a bottle or two extra of your favourite European tipple.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/buil1.jpg","title":"nine storey office scheme for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew A new proposed nine-storey office building in the heart of Belfast city centre could house up to  workers once completed, Ulster Business can reveal. There are now plans to build the grade A office building at Victoria Street. It would see the current Chancery House building knocked down to make way for the development. In , the building was sold off in excess of its guide price of £.m following a competitive bidding process. Chancery House, which is located on the edge of Belfast’s Law Courts and opposite Victoria Square Shopping Centre, was purchased by a local private developer. The fresh planning application has been made by Chancery House Investments Ltd, which includes Northern Ireland businessman Darren Donnelly as a director. Its being designed by Todd Architects alongside planning consultancy Turley. The building would include more than , sq ft of grade A office space, and those behind it have said it “would assist in addressing an identied need in the marketplace for small office floor plates to primarily serve indigenous businesses which are expanding and want a city centre business location”. It also says the design of the development “has been carefully formulated and responds to the immediate context of the site and its surrounding”. “The proposals improve the setting of the Old Town Hall and define its location with a building which adds vibrancy to this important nodal point”. A design statement says the development could accommodate between - office workers. Speaking at the time of the sale of Chancery House, Neil McShane, director at Lambert Smith Hampton, who the sale process, said: “Chancery House represented a unique opportunity in that it is an income-producing investment property with exciting development prospects. The prime location and secure tenant means that it will continue to perform well as an office investment but,redeveloped, will attract signicant interest from potential occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
