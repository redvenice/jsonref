It falls asleep inches from my head and wakes up beside me. I breathe its breath. I’ve always been reluctant to call my apartment “home” here in Catania. Over the past 10 years I’ve traversed the Middle East, photographing cities, their inhabitants and the conflicts that have ravaged that area of the world for decades. The streets of Baghdad, Mosul, Kabul, Amman, Khartoum and Tehran have been my home. I’d always considered those 50 sq metres in Catania as a pied-à-terre, a place to keep my clothes and my photo archive. I never could have imagined that after documenting the desperation of refugee camps in Iraq or mass graves in Sinjar, or aboard an ambulance collecting the dead among the Kurdish resistance in northern Syria, that I’d have to confront the world’s biggest story in my own small apartment.I’ve been living with Covid-19 since mid-March. My mother, my partner, the war reporter Marta Bellingreri, and other people close to me have been infected, but somehow I have been spared. I interpreted this peculiar twist as if Covid-19 had chosen me to photograph it from a different perspective. And I met the challenge, also because the reasons that brought the virus into my apartment are also extraordinarily tied to my career as a photographer.Last 25 February I hosted some friends and family members for a celebratory dinner. World Press Photo had just announced the 2020 winners, and, for the second time, I was selected, for my photograph of an Isis bride embracing her child in the prison camp of Al-Hol, north-east Syria. At the same time, cases of Covid-19 throughout Italy had risen from four to 322. No one could have imagined that Sicily’s patient zero was at that dinner table, a friend who had returned from Germany. He had no idea he was an asymptomatic carrier of the virus. I left the day after for Khartoum with Marta to photograph a country in the throes of revolution for over a year.The call that changed that trip and the following weeks came six days later, in early March, as Italy and the world were changing for the worse. My friend who had been in Germany had tested positive for Covid-19. The alarm was sounded: phone calls to notify those who may have been infected and tests for the older adults who were at the dinner. Some of my family members tested positive, and my mother was taken immediately to an hospital. She’s 69 and has suffered from respiratory illness in the past. Her life was at risk and my world caved in.Turkey, where we had a connecting flight on the way to Sudan, had already cancelled all flights to Italy. Other countries had restricted entry for anyone who had been to Italy in the previous 14 days. Marta started manifesting symptoms: slight headache, a light fever. We started a self-imposed quarantine in Sudan. But we needed to go back. We returned to Italy with a connecting flight through Asia. Later the ministry of health in Sudan contacted us to track down the people we met: no one had symptoms, tests were negative and all were placed in preventive quarantine. Knowing that Sudan still has only six Covid-19 cases made us breathe a sigh of relief.Upon our arrival, everything seemed surreal. People wearing masks, deserted streets. As soon as possible, we had ourselves tested. Marta received a phone call from the doctor: “Good morning. Unfortunately, I have to inform you that you’ve tested positive. You mustn’t leave the house for any reason. If your fever exceeds 38°C or if you have difficulty breathing, call this number. Do you understand?”I tested negative and was incredulous. I’d been with Marta since that dinner on 25 February. And yet, the virus did not seem to be interested in me. The doctor believed that the test was a false negative, because I began developing symptoms. My temperature ranged between 37.3°C and 37.7°C for days. I decided to grab my camera and do something I had never done before: while I had always photographed others’ suffering, now I had to photograph Marta’s suffering and my own, just as Marta’s condition began to worsen. She had trouble breathing and chest pains, as if a stone were lodged in her ribcage. I put myself in self-isolation, spending the next 14 days with Marta, in my apartment, using protective gear.The doctor suggested that we order an oxygen saturation monitor from the local chemist. It became our best friend. “If the level is 95, everything is fine. If it drops to 92, you need to run to the hospital.” My level was 99 Marta’s 98. But she was not doing well: she told me that it was as if she were wearing a bodice with the laces pulled tight. Friends brought us our groceries, leaving them outside the door. We did our best to plan our days: take our temperature, drink our freshly squeezed orange juice, take our temperature again, call the doctor. We included the oxygen monitor in our daily regime and moved on. I saw my mother on Skype. She was now breathing more easily. We exchanged smiles, but I was out of sorts.The doctors asked me to take a second test, but again I tested negative. Perhaps I’m immune? The days dragged on in my apartment, in black and white, like my photos. Sometimes we tried to smile, imagining that I was asymptomatic, because I was the virus. Our smiles seemed to bring good news. My mother left hospital, but I won’t be able to see her for weeks. Marta started breathing well again, and so did I. I would have liked to photograph my country in the midst of this emergency, the battles that the doctors wage on the frontline, the hospitals pushed to their limits, Italy on its knees fighting an invisible enemy. That enemy, a day in March, knocked on my door instead.Alessio Mamo was talking to Lorenzo Tondo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ebbbbf602795b6ec8e51f376b6c1eb794fb700b/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90f11ff43dfb1023004e95833ca53c11","title":"debenhams prepares to file for bankruptcy coronavirus","story":"Chain buckling under coronavirus shutdown just a year after it was rescuedDebenhams is preparing to call in administrators after the struggling department store was forced to close all its outlets under the coronavirus lockdown.The company, which has 22,000 staff and was rescued by its lenders after collapsing into administration only a year ago, is understood to be considering filing a formal notice of intention to appoint administrators next week. The legal process provides protection from creditors for 10 working days while a company tries to secure a rescue deal.Potential administrators lined up this time include KPMG, which handled the Debenhams restructure last May.A Debenhams spokesman said: “Like all retailers, we are making contingency plans reflecting the extraordinary current circumstances. Our owners and lenders remain highly supportive and whatever actions we may take will be with a view to protecting the business during the current situation.”They added: “While our stores remain closed in line with government guidance, and the majority of our store-facing colleagues have been furloughed, our website continues to trade and we are accepting customer orders, gift cards and returns.”It is understood that the potential insolvency measure would be intended to protect the business so it could continue to trade.Debenhams was taken over last year by a group of its financial backers, including the US hedge funds Silver Point and GoldenTree, after falling into administration. It then used an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to cull unprofitable sites and cut rents.The group has closed 22 stores, 19 of which shut in January, resulting in more than 700 job losses. A further 28 of its remaining 141 stores had been lined up for permanent closure next year.Since the coronavirus lockdown Debenhams, which has more than £600m of debt, has written to landlords asking for a five-month rent holiday and reportedly asked suppliers for a 31-day delay to some payments as it seeks to conserve cash.One insider told Sky News, which first reported the retailer’s plan, that there was a realistic prospect that Debenhams’ clothing suppliers would take legal action against the company for deferring invoice payments during the lockdown.Any collapse into administration could pave the way for Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct, to revive its interest in Debenhams.The department store’s CVA plan was subject to a legal challenge amid pressure from Ashley, whose retail group’s investment of £150m was wiped out when Debenhams went into administration. He was keen to combine the department store firm with his House of Fraser chain.Debenhams is one of many retailers in financial difficulties because of the coronavirus shutdown. Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst, said it was likely to be the first of many fashion chains in trouble because of an oversupply in the market, as well as the knock to sales from Covid-19.Even before the pandemic, British department stores had been in difficulty, with shoppers shifting to buying online or spending on experiences such as holidays, digital services and takeaways, and firms struggling with rising costs, including business rates and staff pay.The department chain Beales closed its 23 stores after falling into administration in January, while House of Fraser had shut at least seven of its 59 branches before the government shutdown was announced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58890da92563d49fd6d415d0896bbe30f7eb823a/0_76_2410_1446/master/2410..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ed31dcadeba935ae4ffd5693a806512","title":"labours new leader corbynism more relevant","story":"As Labour’s leader steps down, the world has seldom looked more responsive to the radicalism he stood for• See all our coronavirus coverageIn many ways, Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership ended this week exactly as his enemies always hoped it would. Heavily defeated in a general election, dismissed since as a political irrelevance, and criticised even for questioning the government’s inept handling of the coronavirus crisis, Corbyn probably has a lower reputation now than at any time since he first stood for leader, to much derision, in 2015 – and perhaps even since he became an MP, in 1983. The recent attacks on him for appearing in the House of Commons and working in his Westminster office during the crisis at the age of 70, despite official advice that older people should stay at home, have in a sense taken the years of assaults on his legitimacy to their logical conclusion. To many of his critics, Corbyn has no right to exist as a significant public figure.Yet this drastic shrinking of his status has also coincided, thanks to the crisis, with a huge expansion of what governments do. And expanding the state’s role in society and the economy is what much of Corbyn’s career has been devoted to. Corbynism was – and is – primarily a politics about addressing emergencies: the stark inadequacies of modern capitalism, the damage caused by austerity, and the accelerating effects of the climate crisis.This possibility explains some of the nervousness about the future emanating from the rightwing press and thinktanks. Before coronavirus they were luxuriating in the possibilities they thought had been created by Brexit and Boris Johnson’s election victory. A parallel hope is building on the left that perhaps the future won’t be as politically bleak as it has seemed ever since last December’s exit poll. Corbyn himself told the BBC recently that coronavirus was bringing about “a change in our politics” in favour of a kinder state and society, which was being felt “in every country in the world”.But the hope, or fear, that the left will revive in the traumatised, anxious Britain likely to emerge from the crisis ignores the fact that during the already quite fraught 2010s Labour never managed to make its politics of emergencies sufficiently compelling. Corbyn’s party had energy, innovative policies and – sometimes – a lot of moral authority. Yet, Labour didn’t make enough voters realise that the country’s big social, economic and environmental crises had either been caused, or effectively ignored, by a series of Conservative governments. Nor, almost as damagingly, did Labour interest enough voters in its highly promising solutions, such as the green new deal. During the Corbyn era, I left countless Labour briefings with exciting ideas and rhetoric ringing in my ears, only to discover shortly afterwards that the wider world either hadn’t noticed what had been announced or didn’t trust it.Media bias, the distraction of Brexit, a leader who was reluctant to attack the Tories and was a limited communicator: these are the wearyingly familiar reasons Labour’s messages didn’t cut through, despite everything that was going wrong in Britain in the 2010s. Yet all these obstacles, except the first, will probably diminish or disappear under a new leader.Meanwhile, the Conservatives’ performance over coronavirus may become so obviously disastrous, especially for the older Britons on whom the Tories rely in elections, that it destroys their credibility as a government in a way that the more hidden social catastrophe of austerity did not. Something similar happened on Black Wednesday in 1992. Shortly after a fourth successive Tory election victory, the spectacular and costly collapse of their policy of keeping the pound in the European exchange rate mechanism (a precursor to the euro) dissolved their reputation for economic competence overnight. It became one of the main reasons for their landslide election defeat five years later.The Tories’ mistakes over coronavirus could make Black Wednesday look like a minor mishap. Even more than sensible stewardship of the economy, the Tories trade on their supposed ability to keep out foreign threats and keep the public safe.Yet for Labour to replace them, it will have to become and remain an obvious government in waiting, probably for a long time before the next election, as it did from 1992 to 1997. That will mean exposing Conservative incompetence and moral failings with a precision that Labour hasn’t managed since Tony Blair’s opposition leadership in the mid-90s. All its leaders since – Gordon Brown, Ed Miliband and Corbyn – have lacked Blair’s lawyerly touch.The new leader will also need a believable vision of a Labour-run Britain. The longer a party is out of power, the more abstract – and therefore less credible and appealing – the idea of it being in power can become. Corbyn had a vision: of a radically more equal and greener Britain. But it never quite came into focus for voters. As a leftwinger with a distractingly long past, he probably had an impossible job. The new leader’s will be easier, but not by much."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2325e05c34a783190fc7ccb3740c622fd0d623d8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=561cb581814bf0dfc048959fd41e4a2d","title":"raheem sterling coronavirus matt hancock premier league footballers","story":"In this week’s shifting blame game, health secretary Matt Hancock has kicked Premier League footballers into touchOne of the great rules of British public life is that sooner or later, everything ends up being blamed on footballers. No matter how alien our new world looked at the start of the coronavirus shutdown, you could say one thing for sure: eventually, this will be the fault of Raheem Sterling.I know that so-called experts will rewind through the testing failures, to the herd immunity row, to the 250,000-strong Cheltenham Festival, to the shifting epicentre of the pandemic, to Spain, to Italy, to South Korea, to air travel, to Wuhan, to patient zero, to the bat in the Chinese wet market. But in a very real sense – perhaps the realest – this whole thing traces way back beyond all that. Back, in fact, to UK humankind’s oldest enemy: young men who play in the Premier League.Even in the good times, the same people who thought Brexit was totally worth the nursing crisis it vastly deepened can never wait to tell you how many NHS nurses a footballer’s contract is worth. As discussed frequently in this space, nurses are criminally undervalued. But strangely, it’s only ever footballers whose remuneration is discussed in these precise relative terms. The footballers-nurses discussion takes place in an exchange market in which only two currencies are traded. You rarely hear anyone convert how many nurses’ salaries we could have had instead of a Libyan intervention that helped create a failed state, or instead of some £53m drawings for a garden bridge, or instead of a load of nuclear weapons we wouldn’t even notionally be allowed to use unless the Americans told us to. And without wishing to downgrade the spectator pleasure anyone took from seeing a north African country slide into civil war – GET IN! – people actually like football. They watch it. They frequently claim to live for it. They get more bang for their buck for it than they do with a botched military intervention, which effectively plays behind closed doors. (Though Rupert Murdoch usually owns the rights to both.)Yet to put that into perspective, last year Forbes estimated that just 12 of the richest Premier League owners had a combined worth of £74bn. Are the owners taking a pay cut? Or to put it into another perspective: the Professional Footballers’ Association is run by the galaxy’s highest-paid union boss, one Gordon Taylor, who took home more than £2m last year, yet continually fails his members in a variety of ways, and somehow managed to head off a coup and string out his already 41-year tenure at the top by commissioning a review – a full 16 months ago – into how the union is run. Is he taking a pay cut?Or to put it into arguably the most relevant perspective: it has now been months since Boris Johnson began to be briefed about the threat of the coronavirus many weeks since he was able to watch its ravages take hold on our European doorstep, yet persisted in a mitigation strategy that left the UK’s response a remarkable outlier almost three weeks since he radically changed course two weeks since he promised 25,000 tests a day and a good 48 hours since it was revealed that his government’s pledges had seen just 2,000 NHS frontline workers tested in total. Is he taking a pay cut? Because I want to be sure he’s personally paying the taxpayer £350m a week to be prime minister before we give one second of his airtime to the Newcastle midfield.Disappointingly, Matt Hancock seized on this piece of footballer misdirection in his comeback briefing on Thursday night. That said, the health secretary’s return was relatively welcome, not least because mere hours before, Nigel Farage had broken another 14-second silence to demand his sacking. (Mr Farage, a 56-year-old occasional freelance journalist, called for Hancock’s replacement with a tough outsider who “gets things done”. Louis Van Gaal?)Hancock’s briefing was a vast improvement on the previous day’s effort with alleged business secretary Alok Sharma, when we had to accept the government was not so much playing its reserves but its most talentless fan, who duly spent the entire fixture running away from the ball. As time has worn on, these daily three-person televised set-pieces resemble the prelude to an Apprentice firing. Who will you be bringing back into the boardroom with you, Alok, and attempting to offload the blame on to? The only thing missing is Alan Sugar shouting: “30 bladdy ventilators?! That is a bladdy disgrace!”Hancock unveiled his Five Pillars strategy, which is arguably compromised by the fact that Pillar One is not “Procure a Tardis”. As former Conservative cabinet minister Greg Clark, now chair of the science committee, warned on Thursday, the UK is now “obviously too late” to recover the time lost by failing to mass-test NHS staff. Our best hope is a “Dunkirk” strategy of allowing smaller labs to assist the effort.Ah, Dunkirk. There’s something slightly heartbreaking about watching experts apparently judging that this might be the only language the government understands. Clark himself was only echoing the plea of Paul Nurse, chairman of the respected Francis Crick Institute, who this week urgently tried to find the government’s sweet spot. “Institutes like ours are coming together with a Dunkirk spirit,” he explained. “The government has put some big boats, destroyers, in place. That’s a bit more cumbersome to get working and we wish them all the luck to do that, but we little boats can contribute as well.”This desperate appeal strategy has the flavour of giving a toddler a potty branded with its major obsession. Ooh, look at this thing! What’s that then? You like the Teletubbies, don’t you? Shall we go over and have a closer look? This, but with imploring the government to do what it takes to even get near to adequate virus testing. See, it could be like Dunkirk! You like reading about Dunkirk, don’t you? Shall we make it a fun Dunkirk game and get some health workers tested, yes? Aw, who’s a big boy, Churchill?We began this column with one of the great laws of British public life, and we end with another: the pathological insistence on filtering everything through the prism of the second world war. It runs from Johnson’s Churchill obsession through Nigel Farage’s career misunderstanding of what a single minute of the conflict meant, to people who weren’t born in the blitz telling you “we survived the blitz”. We are never more than six feet away from the events of 75 to 80 years ago. Let’s hope we get the three points this time, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56d0631f46073c1bf256ebfa8f861f1d16ed478f/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98b67105c5be4dd9c793e0d26eae6db0","title":"the guardian view on immunity passports an idea whose time has not come","story":"A phone app seems better than a passport as a way out of the lockdown. This system will need to be temporary, installed at users’ discretion and have privacy at its coreIf ministers think immunity passports or wristbands are the answer to resolving the immediate coronavirus crisis, they are asking the wrong question. Such a system, if implemented, would see one group of people granted the right to retrieve the civil liberties they had lost in the lockdown, and another group hanging around at home while they waited to contract a virus that can kill those it infects.This does not mean that serological testing (for antibodies) is unimportant. It will be vital to get a sense of how far the infection has spread, to gauge how many of us had Covid-19. The science is not clearcut. Those who had coronavirus may not have known it – or they may have been painfully aware of its murderous potential. While people with antibodies are believed to have protection from reinfection, no one is sure how long that protection will last. A passport may give people a sense of false security about the disease.If an antibody test that works could be found, then key parts of the labour force – such as doctors and nurses – could return to work. However, antibody testing needs to be carefully validated. There is a worry that some of the early Chinese tests proved defective. Speed is important. This week, US authorities granted the first emergency-use authorisation for an antibody test.The viral spread of Covid-19 is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing. Hence the need for a lockdown. Digital contact tracing via a smartphone app appears a better way to get back to normal life now than an immunity passport. In this system, a person registers their symptoms or positive test results. Using the phone’s GPS and bluetooth technology, the app then builds a memory of who is nearby and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases. Other nations, which started earlier, have shown that with such technology epidemics can be contained without the need for mass quarantines.The spread of mass surveillance is not to be welcomed but, for a temporary period in this public health crisis, it seems necessary. People should be entitled to decide whether to adopt this platform. Ministers will get buy-in if they explain clearly that the intention is not to impose the technology as a permanent change to society, but to save lives and protect the NHS. There should be legal limitations on the purposes for which this sensitive personal data can be used and who will have access to it. There must be transparency over how and where information will be stored and for how long.Much of the surveillance infrastructure has already been deployed. But the decisions to self-isolate must be, in most cases, down to the inidual. The UK ought not to end up in a place where people who can responsibly leave their homes are barred from entering a supermarket because their smartphones are being allowed to share their Covid-19 history and location with private companies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efd37af4db15d05cebb12d7b8bd71db12270c90e/63_266_3212_1928/master/3212..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e273c2878e5dca9339b7c7bbdb84dc7","title":"how have you been affected by the coronavirus cancellation of the edinburgh festivals","story":"If you were planning on performing or attending the festivals, we’d like to hear from youThe cancellation of this year’s Edinburgh festivals, including the world-famous fringe, will be felt far and wide.

They are taking the necessary time, they are very demanding on information, which is not bad. But we believe that once we have the first novel food given a green light from EFSA that will have a snowball effect.”In the eyes of leading players in the insects-as-food industry, the potential for their high-protein delicacies has been held back by a lack of EU-wide approval.The UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Finland have taken a permissive approach to a 1997 EU law that requires foods not eaten before that year to get novel food authorisation.Those national regulators decided the EU law did not pertain to animals used for food. As a result, a host of insect-based products can be found in British, Dutch, Belgian and Finnish supermarkets. About 500 tonnes of insect-based food for human consumption is produced every year.But such products are banned in France, Italy and Spain, among other countries. In 2018, a new EU law sought to bring some clarity. It stipulated that insect-based dishes would also require novel food authorisation.A transition period was established to allow companies already producing food from insects to operate until they received a judgment on the safety of the species they work with and final approval by the EU’s institutions.Indeed, companies such such as Protifarm in the Netherlands, Micronutris in France, Essento in Switzerland and Entogourmet in Spain are said to be preparing to ramp up their operations.“We have many of our members building bigger factories because the key to success is to upscale your companies and produce on a mass scale. And this is already happening,” Derrien said. “We are expecting the next few years will be very interesting ones and obviously the novel food authorisations will definitely help.”He added: “The sort of foods ranges from whole insects as an aperitif or as snacks to processed insects in bars or pasta or burgers made out of insects. We believe that insects for food is one solution for some of the biggest challenges we are facing on the planet.

It will definitely impact the model of carbon flows,” said Oregon State University microbiologist Steve Giovannoni. “It will require more than just a small tweak.”Researchers say the spring phytoplankton bloom in the North Atlantic is probably the largest annual biological carbon sequestration mechanism on the planet. Like a vast forest of tiny plants in the sunlight upper part of the ocean, they draw down carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The bigger the plankton, the higher the chance they will sink into the deep mesopelagic zone of the ocean, where carbon can be trapped for more than 1,000 years.Until now, climate models have assumed that diatoms – one of the biggest types of plankton – were dominant. But the study, published in the International Society for Microbial Ecology Journal, reveals they are a very minor share of biomass when compared with much smaller cyanobacteria, picophytoeukaryotes and nanophytoeukaryotes.This was expected in winter, but the research team found that even in spring – shortly before the annual bloom – there were far fewer diomeds in the western North Atlantic than assumed“We asked, how could our impressions of this ocean region be so far off?” Giovannoni said. “There are three possibilities: new equipment that allows us to see smaller plankton more clearly, the fact that previous studies had focussed on more eastern regions, and climate change altering the biology of the ocean.”Although the findings of this study of one part of the North Atlantic – much of it carried out in fierce gales – do not necessarily apply to all oceans, Giovannoni said they highlight how little is understood of marine biology, as well as the need for close-up study.Nasa and other satellite monitoring agencies have previously used images from space to assess the carbon draw-down capacity of algae blooms, but they will need to revise the assumptions on which their calculations are based."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e7707e8b589989d0948b7fed39b024817738c6a/312_0_3770_2263/master/3770..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12420e224cbf1fb06b5e508080afb3fb","title":"coffee kareem review fast foul and fitfully funny netflix comedy","story":"A handful of amusing lines and a standout turn from Glow’s Betty Giplin can’t elevate this crass and convoluted spin on a familiar buddy movie setupThere’s a better movie buried underneath the many corpses in the crude and confused Netflix comedy Coffee \u0026amp Kareem, one of their algorithmically assembled weekend options patchworked together from a stack of search terms. It’s an attempt to update a buddy movie formula that flourished most in the 1980s with films like 48 Hours, Turner \u0026amp Hooch and Tango \u0026amp Cash but with a half-open eye on the current climate. The most recent theatrical attempt, the Kumail NanjianiDave Bautista-starring Stuber, flopped last summer while Netflix has seen its own, the Mark WahlbergWinston Duke vehicle Spenser Confidential, reportedly score huge streaming numbers, despite a small issue of quality.It’s a platform that then makes a lot more sense for a throwback such as this with Stuber director Michael Dowse returning to try his luck again within similar territory, in extremely quick succession. It’s based on a script from the first-time writer Shane Mack, one that attracted enough attention in 2014 to be included on the Black List, an annual roundup of the best unproduced screenplays doing the rounds. There’s just about enough here to see why with Mack’s knack for comedy, both broad and weirdly specific, proving that at the very least he’d make a solid inclusion in any sitcom writers room. His dialogue is overstuffed with quips but for every one that lands, about five others tank, with an overreliance on lewd one-liners.In the first 15 minutes we’re promised something far more entertaining than what the following 70 minutes deliver. Incompetent cop John Coffee (Ed Helms) is dating single mother Vanessa (Taraji P Henson), much to the annoyance of her son Kareem (Terrence Little Gardenhigh), who is forced to spend time with him after school one day. In a set of circumstances that would seem far-fetched even if the film were animated and populated by talking animals, the two end up on the run from some “bad guys” after the same criminal who escaped from Coffee’s custody is also approached by Kareem to beat Coffee up. The pair have to then get along etc, etc.The lack of certification on Netflix content and any restrictions that would then come with it has meant that quite often, films or shows that would otherwise be tailored for a wide PG-13 audience are given a free pass to go hard R. It can be jarring to suddenly hear the word cunt in an otherwise tame romantic comedy and in Coffee \u0026amp Kareem, a silly kids movie set-up is matched with an overwhelmingly aggressive crudeness as every opportunity for puerile jokes about shit, dicks, asses and rape are rolled out until any shock value has been completely beaten to a pulp. The novelty of watching a 12-year-old curse was tested in last year’s Good Boys, a joke that isn’t unfunny the first time or maybe even the second but when it becomes a lazy substitute for, say, an actual witticism soon starts to grow dull.It’s a strange movie that can seem mildly interested in tackling bigger issues before swiftly backing down. Any contemporary comedy about the dynamic between a white cop and a black boy can’t avoid the uncomfortable reality that we often associate with such a pairing and Mack’s script highlights the distrust that Kareem understandably has for Coffee. But its treatment feels a bit too flip for such an uneasy subject and elsewhere Mack relies on tired stereotype subversions such as the black henchmen who are, twist, surprisingly sensitive and the black stripper who is, twist, surprisingly academically ambitious, that feel patronising at best. There’s also a confused attempt to make some sort of comment on the gay panic humour that often pervades films such as this but Mack’s long-running joke, that to scare men away you have to pretend to be aggressively gay, isn’t smartly employed enough for it to work as satire and, as such, just comes off as a bit questionable.Barely 90 minutes and barely memorable enough to stay in one’s mind for any longer, Coffee \u0026amp Kareem is truly decaf entertainment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5390f82dbc22ff1420f46c8a510b50c683140959/0_10_4896_2938/master/4896..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfbfe03b2d2421ccc6f5a4f32503d3cd","title":"how to eat takeaway while under coronavirus lockdown","story":"You’re trapped at home and you fancy ordering in. Should you use a delivery app? How do you tip? Do you need starters? And is being able to order precisely what you want, even now, a fundamental human right?Loth as How to Eat (HTE) is to break the fourth wall, it will come as no surprise to learn that this month’s topic is not what was originally planned. Over the years, HTE has stood firm against some implacable foes: people who put mayo on bacon butties, those who refuse to accept whipped cream with scones, but even it must bend in the whirlwind that is a global pandemic.April had been marked down as the month HTE would consider Kate Bush’s favourite breakfast, shakshuka (think about it). But with going for a leisurely brunch now a remote possibility, HTE must pivot indoors and consider what – for those who can still afford it – has become the highlight of the food week: the takeaway.Britain’s fondness for takeaway food has created something like a £5bn-a-year business (a £57-a-month habit for the league leaders Northern Ireland) that has ballooned in the past decade. In recent weeks, however, the options have grown enormously as many restaurants turn to takeout as a way of maintaining a little turnover.In a rare, swift and seemingly wholly positive intervention, the government removed all red tape for pubs and restaurants that wish to offer takeaway. The reasoning may not be entirely altruistic (maintaining a national network of functioning kitchens that could be requisitioned if the crisis deepens seems like sensible emergency planning), but, nonetheless, it has led to a swathe of, particularly smaller, independent restaurants launching no-contact collection and delivery services for the first time.Indeed, something unexpected appears to be happening, according to the Financial Times. A foodie cohort have been eager to support their favourite local restaurants, but, as their core volume brands such as McDonald’s and Wagamama close, the established delivery providers, such as Deliveroo, are experiencing a slump in sales, it is claimed.With takeaway now one of the few ways we can still enjoy ourselves, it is crucial we ring every scintilla of pleasure from it. HTE is here to help.Be warned also that if you try to order at the last minute on Saturday evening, you may find many hot restaurants are too busy to accept fresh orders. Last Saturday, HTE had to park its hunger for Chinese and instead order in advance for Sunday. Takeaway is now something you have to plan.Obviously, whether you are collecting a takeaway or waiting on delivery at home, you should keep your two metres distance. Want the definition of “strange times”? Kebab shops where you order remotely for collection, walk up, shout your name through an open door and then wait for your order to be left on a table by the entrance a cordon sanitaire for the doner kebab.Despite reports to the contrary, the World Health Organization has not specifically advised people to stop using cash. The Covid-19 advice on cash is as for anything you could touch in public: wash your hands and keep them away from your face. Nonetheless, that slight risk of transmission does make tipping delivery riders problematic at a time when tips are potentially financially crucial for delivery staff and their families.One plus for Uber Eats is that it allows you to tip electronically after delivery. But if your faith in human nature is robust, where it exists as an option, pre-tip as you order. Otherwise, let your deliverer know you have left money on the doorstep. You could even reassure them you have washed your coins or a polymer notes with soapy water first.In the realm of takeaway, there are two resolute buzzkills. The first is the “fakeaway” enthusiast who says: “Hey, guys, we could cook a healthier version right here.” (As if that were the aim.) These people are oblivious to just how crucial a tandoor, proper wok burner or wood-fired oven is to Indian, Chinese or Italian food. You cannot replicate that action in a domestic oven.The second is that person in your household who, too busy for the frivolous business of eating, yells down the stairs: “Whatever, just order for me,” and then proceeds to moan about everything. The ordering of takeaway, at a macro- (Italian, Mexican, Vietnamese, Thai?) and micro-level (peshwari or keema naan?) is a debate that in serious households can rival the Yalta conference in terms of length, horse-trading and bitter resentment. If you are not willing to engage, you cannot sulk because there are no salt’n’pepper ribs.The only people who want starters with a takeaway are people who have never eaten takeaway. Why do want to leave your main to go cold? Yes, you could turn the oven on to keep it warm. Yes, you could resort to the microwave. But let’s not turn this into a logistical palaver. The point of takeaway is it should be less hassle than cooking.Sides are fine and, HTE sees no reason for pedantry, these may involve repurposed starters that can perch on the side of your plate as a complement to your main: seekh kebabs, tandoor-licked lamb chops, spring rolls etc. The important point is everything must be served contemporaneously and immediately, while it is still warm.Fail to prepare, prepare to fail … is not a phrase HTE finds itself using. But takeaway is a meal that requires you to channel David Brent. As described above, in order to eat warm food in its peak condition, the moments just after a takeaway enters your home are crucial. Plates must be warmed, drinks poured, cutlery and kitchen roll distributed and Netflix primed, so that, in a matter of seconds, the food can slot seamlessly into its new habit. If, as a family or cohabitants, you are not whirring with the balletic grace and energy of Manchester City’s midfield in the minutes before your takeaway arrives, then you are doing something wrong.This is another reason against any form of supplementary cooking taking place to augment the takeaway – what the comedian Kevin Bridges memorably dubbed “hoose rice”. Beyond buttering your own bread for fish and chips (an act so personal you will always execute it in a superior way to the chip shop), your work should be no more complex than opening bags and boxes with the minimum of delay.Note: if charged with transferring poppadoms or prawn crackers to another room for sharing, it is morally repugnant to then sit down and eat half of them before everyone else is settled. HTE blames Thatcher.Historically, to plate or not to plate has been seen as a telling sociopolitical faultline. To plate a takeaway is seen as ridiculously posh, but HTE has always preferred to view this issue pragmatically – that is, until Covid-19 came along.Before March 2020, certain takeaway foods were always better eaten as is. Fish and chips die a death decanted on to porcelain, pizza invariably tastes better from the box and only a barbarian would disrobe a burrito and plonk it on to a plate. This is partly a matter of psychology, but mainly a practical issue. If you unwrap them, all the above go cold too quickly. Conversely, despite the advances in cardboard boxes and other cartons, most Asian food is at its best transferred to plates and bowls. Eating a curry and rice from the plastic boxes it arrives is unnecessarily hard work. You would have to have a militant dislike of doing the dishes to persevere with it.But coronavirus has rendered this argument null and void with wise scientific counsel urging us to, while the risk is small, remove all the packaging from any takeaway food that comes into the house and – you’ve guessed it – wash our hands after plating it.One upside of this is that, for the foreseeable, it makes the takeaway buffet less likely. “Why don’t I just order a load of stuff and everyone can help themselves?” is, perhaps, the most frightening sentence in food one that always results in everyone sitting around too little food, tolerating meagre helpings of the dishes they really wanted and grudgingly nibbling at others they do not like. Moreover, with all those trays and cartons on the table, this serving method means you spend as much time playing pass-the-parcel as eating. It is fundamentally annoying.It may work with pizza (the exception that proves the rule), but the notion that the bulk of a takeaway should be shared by all is flawed. It is dictatorial. You do not want your plate to end up looking like a jumble sale, an unholy tangle of jarring dishes. Instead, taking an Indian meal as the easiest example, everyone should be allowed to choose their main and then dip in and out of the supplementaries as they see fit (rice, dal, breads, aforementioned sides-not-starters).Who is to say? Traditionally, Friday or Saturday night at the end of the working week, maybe a hungover Sunday. But that was back when time had meaning and you knew which day it was.So, takeaway, how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2abf668252f436f354b997881c525458b3b92f58/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b58b1d32bd143ee1cddef12b82142558","title":"jamie vardy golden boot unfinished subplot premier league","story":"Spare a thought for the Premier League’s current top scorer, whose own season is one of the great unfinished subplotsThere have been a lot of lists doing the rounds this week of the best foods to boost your immune system. These seem to be mainly things such as oily fish, yoghurt, spinach, elderberries, ginger and raw shaved garlic, although having followed these ingredients to the letter I can confirm they don’t actually make for a very nice sandwich.From a Premier League perspective there are some notable absences from the roster of miracle foods. Cheese and ham omelettes. Shotgunned cans of Red Bull. Skittles dissolved in vodka. Chewing tobacco. Watered-down port drunk from an old Lucozade bottle.Basically it’s worth considering anything that has, according to his own tales of pre-match intake, gone into the making of Jamie Vardy, who qualifies these days as one of the most enduring, age-resistant elite-level athletes in Europe albeit one whose career has also been left in a particularly strange state of tension by the sporting hiatus.It still feels a little odd to keep talking about the Premier League season as a robust and meaningful entity. In reality it doesn’t matter if the league is cancelled or postponed, or if Liverpool are actually awarded the league title.Mainly because the human race is being menaced by a murderous plague and the world economy is about to collapse. But also because the trophy is just a symbolic reward for being the best team that season. Liverpool have so clearly been the best that to obsess over the actual pot is to lose yourself in needless literalism, which of course nobody in football would ever do.But there are still some unresolved questions. Spare a thought for Vardy, whose own season is one of the great unfinished subplots. It has been a slightly strange one. Vardy has 19 league goals, mainly clumped into 17 in 16 games from August to December. That run was followed by no goals in nine games, coincidently just after stories appeared suggesting Vardy had actually reformed his omelette and Red Bull intake after advice from (spare me) leading sport nutritionists.Four days before the season was finally put into cold storage he managed to burp out a couple in a 4-0 home win against Aston Villa, putting him safely out in front in the race for the Premier League golden boot.There is a rather overlooked addendum to this achievement. Should Vardy end up top of that list he would be the oldest top scorer in the English top tier since Ronnie Rooke of Arsenal in 1948.Rooke scored 33 goals and turned 37 halfway through the season. Very few 30-somethings have topped the list since. The vast majority have been in their early or mid-20s. Vardy will be 33 and a half at the season’s scheduled end date.There is something about the manner of this feat as much as its execution. Vardy isn’t simply hanging on. He hasn’t changed, hasn’t settled. His first yard isn’t in his head these days. It’s still right there in his feet, powered by Tic Tacs and Skittles, a man who still plays as if he wants to devour the day.It is the same quality that was there in his Premier League debut against Manchester United five and a half years ago. United had Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie in attack that day. They went 3-1 up. At which stage the combined Premier League goal tallies read Rooney-RVP-Falcao 310, Vardy nil.By the end Vardy had made four and scored one and Leicester had won 5-3. He’d run away from United’s defenders so easily they seemed to have been reduced to tiny little red-shirted figurines, Lego men left out in the middle of all that green space. He dished up the first Premier League sighting of the classic Vardy finish, all brusque, high-speed impudence. At the time we thought Leicester’s victory was telling us something calamitous about United. In fact it was telling us something glorious about Vardy.Vardy started Leicester’s next 45 league games. They won the title. He now has 99 top-flight goals. For a while people said he’d benefitted from missing the rigours of junior pro academy life, as though this was some kind of supercharged foundling, discovered haring around the local scrub ground like a fly trapped behind a roller blind.But Vardy has also developed as a player. He still plays as though he’s just come vaulting over the advert boards chased by farmers and policemen in old heavy serge uniforms, here to steal the lettuces and goose the goalkeeper before haring off down the high street to his getaway scooter. But he is a more complete version of himself these days, finding deeper gears, making different runs, creating as well as scoring.And so to the break. What is it going to do to Vardy, or indeed to all those overripe high-end talents pushing the limits of their own physique? Vardy has just kept running through all this. But he will turn 34 in January. He’s a year older than Lionel Messi, three years older than Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and seven years older than Harry Kane.Perhaps the enforced rest will allow all of these players to reset and recover from long-term pain. There is a handy precedent. Rooke had seven years away from football during the war years, six of those spent as an RAF PT instructor.Still, though, the Vardy Supremacy feels distinct, a standalone feat of will and physicality. There hasn’t really been a career such as this in modern times, a late-bloom affair that just keeps on coming, which deserves, when we get going again, a shot at that boundary-pushing golden boot. And which is, in these times of interruption and store-cupboard lockdown, still quietly cheering."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c7e51d8091f5fe3e3f41afd5a73d41aa17ffc56/79_0_5540_3324/master/5540..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ee07dc4af48b51b5d4a43308a0733cc","title":"from mouldy showers to junk drawers how to clean the 10 things annoying you most","story":"Over the past week you may have noticed dust and dirt that you never clocked before. Here’s an expert guide to getting your home sparkling cleanYou have never spent so much time at home, and once you have exhausted Netflix, your eyes may alight on all the filth you’ve never noticed before. Have you ever dusted your ceiling? Of course you haven’t. But now is the time to do it, because you don’t have anything better to do. Here are all the other jobs you were previously too busy to worry about, but which will provide a sense of achievement – or at least a little exercise.Easily the worst job in the house, but a gleaming oven will become one of your life’s new pleasures. “Prevention is better than cure,” says Gemma Bray, the creator of the Organised Mum Method. “I swear by oven liners, which will catch everything at the bottom of the oven. You take it out and quickly rinse it under the tap. But before you can start using an oven liner you have to start off with a clean oven.”You can go for a heavy-duty oven cleaner, but many people are put off by the harsh chemicals these contain. “Other people swear by using bicarbonate of soda in a paste, which I have never really had much success with, especially if you are battling a really grimy oven.”Bray takes out racks and leaves them to soak in a bath of very hot, soapy water. “Washing-up liquid is one of the best things for tackling grease. Slowly, little and often, work on the bottom of the oven – even in 15-minute slots.” Wait until after you have used the oven, and it has cooled but is still warm. “Use hot, soapy water and a cloth, and every time you use the oven go in there, go at it and eventually you’ll start to see a difference.”To clean a microwave, slice up a lemon and put it in a bowl of water. “Put it in for five minutes at full power,” says Lynsey Crombie, AKA the Queen of Clean and author of The Easy Life: Quick Ways to Clean and Manage Your Home All Year Round. Leave to cool for a while – you don’t want a face full of scalding steam – then wipe with a cloth.“Take everything out and put it in a cool bag,” says Aggie MacKenzie, the TV cleaning expert who runs AggiesTips. “Have a sink full of hot, soapy water ready and wash all the shelves. Wipe the inside of the fridge with water and a microfibre cloth – you don’t really want to be introducing much in the way of products. The drip tray at the back can get clogged up, maybe with bits of labels from jars. Get a cotton bud, put some kitchen roll round it and dab in and out of the hole to keep it free-flowing.”If you can manage, pull the fridge out and clean behind it. “That’s when you discover you’ve got mice, or you’ve had mice – you’ll see droppings,” says MacKenzie. Gently dust or vacuum the condenser coils at the back of the fridge.An unsightly lavatory is bothersome, but easily forgotten after every flush. Tackle it once and for all. You need to remove some of the water first so as not to dilute the cleaning product too much, says Crombie. Scoop it out with rubber-gloved hands, or “plunge” it down the U-bend with a toilet brush. “Put some limescale-removing product down there and leave overnight.” Denture tablets or soda crystals will also work. But Crombie cautions: “If you put it down and someone uses the toilet within half an hour, you’re not giving it an opportunity to work. The reason I don’t advise bleach is it doesn’t break limescale down. It will look better, but in a few days it will come back.”“I use a 5050 ratio of white vinegar and water solution in an old spray bottle,” says Bray. “It helps to tackle the limescale and dirt. If you’ve got a clogged-up showerhead – check first it won’t damage the surface – you can sit it in a white-vinegar solution. I try to use as few chemicals as possible in the house.”For the black mould spots around the silicone, “get some tissue paper and soak it in a bleach solution”. Your shower curtain can probably go in the washing machine – check the label – as can a non-slip bathmat. “They can go a bit gunky underneath, but they come out like new.”Shop-bought window cleaning products or vinegar will work on the glass. “If you have UPVC frames, use a cream cleaner or a damp sponge with bicarbonate of soda on,” says Crombie. “For wooden, painted windows, dry dust them then clean with an orange-oil-based product, to protect the wood. Don’t forget to clean the handle – just use what you’ve been using on the frame.” Vacuum your curtains, and wipe blinds.This is the time to be ruthless. Empty it out, says MacKenzie. Give the inside of the drawer a vacuum and a wipe with a damp cloth. Then “only put back the things you use. If you think: ‘I might need that one day,’ no, you won’t because you haven’t used it in the last year. I used to have a dish full of keys and I never knew what they were for. One day I just threw them away. Did I come to any grief? No.” Rehome items to the places they belong.Remove whatever it is you are storing under your bed and clean off the dust (there will be a thick layer), then vacuum underneath. “It’s a good time to flip your mattress if it needs it,” says Crombie. “Give it a vacuum.” If you have a steam cleaner, use this too. “Hold the steamer 30cm away from the mattress – people go too close and get the mattress wet and then they can’t go to bed. Leave the window open so the mattress can dry. If you have stains on your mattress, a carpet-cleaning product should get them off.”She recommends a homemade fabric freshener: 20 teaspoons of bicarbonate of soda and 20 drops of lavender essential oil in a 500ml bottle of water. “Just spritz it on.” Pillows can usually be washed – check the instructions.Wallpaper, particularly if it hasraised patterns, can benefit from a vacuum. “Gently go over it with a brush attachment, or with a dry microfibre cloth or paintbrush,” says Crombie. “If you have a flat-headed mop, use that to dry-dust your ceiling.” While you are at it, use a brush (a clean paintbrush, or old makeup brush) to dust light fittings.Although some paint is washable, Crombie says she wouldn’t recommend it, “but you can dry-dust”. For marks, use a Magic Eraser or similar, or get a sponge and gently wipe. Don’t forget doors, particularly those with dirt-attracting panels, and frames. “I use warm soapy water, and dry it instantly with a clean dry microfibre cloth.”If you are spending a lot more time on the sofa, you may as well improve your environment. Give it a thorough vacuum, including in the crevices and under the seat pads. “Get a damp microfibre cloth and gently rub at any stains,” says MacKenzie. “If you have ingrained dirt, borrow a steam cleaner. Check the labels of your cushion covers – some can be washed. I wouldn’t wash feathered cushion pads, but most are synthetic fibres so follow the washing instructions.” Pull out the sofa and vacuum underneath. “Behind it, you’ll see a massive layer of dust on the skirting board. That’s where a lot of dust mites are.”Finally, give your cleaning tools some attention. “String mops give me the heebie-jeebies,” says MacKenzie. “A much better mop is a flat-headed one, with a cloth pad you take off after each time you wash your floor and stick in the washing machine. I wash my dustpan brush in the kitchen sink and dry it outside.”Bray uses a new dishcloth each day and saves them up until they can go in the washing machine on a hot wash. But she cautions against overdoing it. On her 100,000-strong Facebook group, “a lot of them are prone to overcleaning. I always tell people just do what you need to do and don’t feel you have to be cleaning all day, because otherwise it can turn into a bit of an unhealthy obsession.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b514c21a9658e5b5008c15c138d96414894ee0e/7_0_582_349/master/582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5567a9ad093c41d7eb2cfb2d4489918b","title":"need a dj to get the party started call me in about 15 years time","story":"I’ve bought the gear. When I get better, my wife might even let me out of the garageWhen I first started this column, I found “midlife crisis” a possible misnomer, because I saw myself as just a cool guy in his 40s, someone younger guys look at and go, “You know what? When I get to his age I hope that I’m as much of a legend as he is.” However, this week I have run towards the midlife crisis with my arms open wide, ready to embrace it, move in with it, and resent it as the early magic of the relationship wanes. This week, I bought DJ equipment.I am not saying that I am too old to DJ. I am friends with DJ Yoda, who is about my age and is one of the best DJs in the world. Every time I see him release a mix or play a club, I am filled with envy. In fact, it is highly possible that I am jeopardising our relationship by getting this equipment. I am hoping that he is not going to see this and take it to mean that I think I can be a DJ.I remember doing a standup gig a while ago and a schoolfriend I hadn’t seen for ages came to watch. At the end of the gig, he came up to me and said, “I actually think I’m going to become a comedian” and I wanted to smash his face in. My ego translated that to: “If a dickhead like you can do it, then surely I can.”So why the hell have I spent a shedload of cash on the equipment? Admittedly, I used to DJ. My dad ran a pub and needed somebody to get the party started. My brother and I bought CD decks and we started “playing out” at the Prince of Wales. I remember getting carried away and actually doing mic work to get the crowd on the dancefloor. One of the things I am most proud of is that my wife was at many of those nights, saw me behaving as if I was Calvin Harris to a lager-soaked room of 20 people, and still decided to have children with me.The coronavirus lockdown has seen people increasingly turn to DJs. Gok Wan has been doing regular sets on Instagram, as have lots of regular club spinners. D-Nice – the old-school rapper turned DJ – recently did a set on Instagram that got over 100,000 people enjoying it in their inidual homes.I should be clear: my ambition is not to join them. In order for me to arrive at the standard required, the lockdown would have to continue for about 10 to 15 years. I see it as equivalent to buying a guitar or piano, which I suppose would be equally worrying for my family.I did tell my wife I was planning on buying the equipment, and she said she couldn’t wait to see it. When it arrived, it became clear that she had thought I was joking. Now I have to learn in the garage.Hip-hop has positioned the DJ at the forefront of the culture, perhaps less so now than previously. But I have grown up watching DJs manipulate old music and create new music in ways that seem impossible. Listen to anything by Jaguar Skills and be prepared to be blown away.My own goal, though, is just to dick about until I get to a good enough standard that my wife lets me back into the house. I can’t deny, however, that I haven’t thought about the slim possibility that Kendrick Lamar happens to be driving through Crawley, hears some absolute fire coming from a garage, and demands to hire that DJ immediately."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f324e54536bc665d3fa306b2e157923d3d894b64/106_762_3494_2096/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b838bb4f3b30d0cf129758e931dadb04","title":"the idea of moving home is now our chief distraction and a source of hope","story":"My boyfriend and I are tempering the worry with Pinterest boards and appliance reviewsLast year my boyfriend and I were supposed to move into our own place, but a change in our circumstances meant we could not.

Since then, the UK government has been accused of issuing mixed messages, of over-promising and under-delivering – the UK’s daily testing rate has only just passed 10,000.11 March: Tests to be expandedThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, insists the government is “rolling out a big expansion of testing” but declines to give a specific timetable. NHS England says there are plans to increase coronavirus testing to 10,000. The UK-wide death toll stands at eight – 1,215 people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK.12 March: Tests to be restrictedThe UK moves from the “contain” to the “delay” phase of its plan to tackle coronavirus. Boris Johnson announces that health workers will no longer test people for the virus in their homes, but will continue to test people already in hospitals.The WHO urges countries to “test, test, test”. 3,826 people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK.18 March: ‘Test 25,000 a day’ – but no timetableBoris Johnson announces the ambition of carrying out 25,000 tests a day, but provides no detail. 5,779 tests are carried out that day.19 March: ‘Antibody tests coming soon’ – but no timetableThe prime minister says mass testing to see if people have already contracted the virus, and are probably therefore immune, will take place relatively soon, which he says would be a game-changer. The UK death toll from coronavirus stands at 144.24 March: ‘UK has 3.5m antibody tests’ – but no timetableMatt Hancock announces the government has bought 3.5m antibody tests, which can determine if someone has had coronavirus. He repeats that general testing will be ramped up, but with no timeframe for deployment. 6,491 tests are performed.25 March: ‘UK aiming for 250,000 tests a day’ – but no timetableJohnson tells the daily Downing Street press conference: “We are going up from 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day, to 25,000, hopefully very soon up to 250,000 per day.” 6,583 tests are carried out.25 March: ‘Antibody tests within days’ – then deniedEarlier that day, Prof Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at PHE, says mass antibody testing in the UK will be possible within days. The government later takes a more cautious line, saying the tests will not be available so quickly.27 March: ‘Dramatic increase planned’ – but no timetableMichael Gove announces that a “new alliance” of businesses, research institutes and universities will boost antigen testing capacity (which checks if someone has the virus) for frontline workers. He says hundreds of people will receive the tests over the weekend and that there will be a “dramatic” increase in testing the following week.31 March: ‘Testing hampered by chemical shortage’Only 8,240 people are tested on this day. Gove says the availability of certain chemicals is limiting the ability to rapidly increase testing capacity.Despite its 27 March announcement, Downing Street confirms that only 2,000 people out of 500,000 frontline NHS England workers had been tested for coronavirus so far. Public Health England’s Prof Yvonne Doyle appears to confirm that the UK’s strategy is now to increase testing for the virus in the general population. A total of 9,793 tests are carried out.2 April: Government sets new target – and admits 3.5m antibody tests don’t workTesting passes 10,000 a day for the first time since the start of the crisis, with 10,215 carried out. Hancock sets a new government target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April – including both antibody and antigen tests. He says the UK wants to buy 17.5m antibody tests, “subject to them working”, and that early tests had been “poor”. None of the 3.5m tests bought by the government – and announced on 24 March – have been found to work so far.Hancock tells broadcasters that the prime minister’s 25 March commitment to get to 250,000 tests a day “still stands”, but that he wanted to “put a very clear timeline” on the goal to get to 100,000 by the end of the month. He says it is “frustrating” that the first antibody tests have not worked. The prime minister’s spokesman is forced to clarify that the 100,000 target is for England only."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b81e06737f0154e459b766a072ff0d2b06471fc/0_191_3482_2089/master/3482..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdbc1c5b4fd98f9a0bb422557abb9b64","title":"keir starmer poised to be announced new labour leader","story":"Allies say scale of anticipated win will determine extent to which he can transform partyKeir Starmer’s plans to transform the Labour party will be dictated by the scale of his anticipated victory on Saturday, key supporters have said, as senior Jeremy Corbyn supporters expressed concerns they could be purged from key positions.Allies of the former director of public prosecutions say they will be watching to see whether he can achieve an emphatic win before assessing how quickly he can remake the party in his own image, with a clearout of those responsible for the damaging 2019 election defeat.MPs who support Starmer, 57, are hoping that a resounding victory will put pressure on some of the key iniduals close to Corbyn to step down. They are said to include Karie Murphy, Corbyn’s chief of staff and one of the election’s directors, and Jennie Formby, the party’s general secretary.One Starmer supporter said: “If Keir wins comfortably among the membership and affiliates on Saturday, the pressure on Murphy and Formby to stand down will be huge. It might not be within the rules, but sometimes the politics overtake the rules.“We are a democratic, slow-moving organisation and we cannot just throw people out, but one would hope that a big victory would mean they get the message and step down.”The shadow Brexit secretary is favourite to beat Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy to become Labour’s leader, with a decision to be announced at 10.45am on Saturday.Nearly 785,000 party members and affiliated members have voted, according to official figures. Each of the candidates has recorded a victory video to be played if they win. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, is favourite to become deputy leader.The contest comes after a devastating 80-seat general election defeat to Boris Johnson’s Conservatives in December, and an ongoing inquiry into antisemitism within the party conducted by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.In the event of a victory, Starmer’s associates say he will want to get hold of the party’s central structures in Southside, central London, to ensure that staff work with the leader’s office, which is based in parliament.Only the party’s national executive committee (NEC) can remove the party’s general secretary, and it is controlled by Corbyn supporters and their allies.Any attempt to remove Formby, an ally of the Unite leader, Len McCluskey, could result in months of internal wrangles. “If Jennie wishes to stay in post, she can. The last general secretary, Iain McNicol, stuck around for years under Jeremy Corbyn and was accused of undermining him,” said one former Corbyn aide.A sub-plot to Saturday’s leadership election will be the election of three new members to the NEC. Starmer’s allies are hoping that his supporters will win those posts.If Starmer wins, he will also be able to remove three Corbyn appointees to the NEC - Long-Bailey, Jon Trickett and Diane Abbott - and appoint three new shadow frontbench members, which may edge him closer to a majority on the party’s ruling body.It is understood that Labour’s director of communications and strategy, Seumas Milne, a former  columnist, has already informed the party of his plans to stand down.Milne and Murphy, a former aide to Tom Watson and a close friend of McCluskey, are on permanent contracts with the party. Most of those who work for the leader of the opposition are on time-limited contracts that end at the same time as Corbyn’s leadership.Among those tipped for promotion to shadow ministerial positions if Starmer wins are the MP for Tottenham, David Lammy the Oxford East MP, Anneliese Dodds and the Birmingham Edgbaston MP, Preet Gill. He would also be expected to keep Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, in position during the coronavirus crisis, and may also keep the shadow leader of the house, Valerie Vaz, and the shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne, on the frontbench.Starmer and his team have held a series of video conferences with up to 50 MPs in recent weeks as his team seeks to bring together different wings of the party.Those who have participated have included Kate Hollern, Corbyn’s former parliamentary private secretary, and the former ministers Angela and Maria Eagle.Tulip Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn and a Starmer ally, said they had been brought together by a desire to win elections, eradicate anti-semitism within the party and stop the in-fighting.“We have to change the structures, drop the factionalism and focus on winning. I don’t think he has an easy task on his hands. Uniting the party will be difficult, making Labour relevant again will be difficult. Winning back the Jewish community will be difficult,” she said.“He’s not the messiah, but it is so important to have a good leader. If we elect him, it will be a start in the right direction.”An associate of Long-Bailey, a Corbyn supporter, said she had run a hard campaign, but conceded that Starmer’s had successfully targeted many of Labour’s “paper” members, who rarely attend meetings. “If we can push the contest to second preferences, that would be a reasonable achievement,” the associate said.Starmer’s personal team would be likely to include Morgan McSweeney as chief of staff. Ben Nunn, his current spokesman, would become director of communications. Claire Ainsley of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who used to work for Unite, would serve as director of policy.Starmer has also approached Helene Reardon Bond, Corbyn’s office manager and a former senior civil servant. She could serve as deputy chief of staff.Murphy and Formby were approached via Labour for a comment. Starmer’s spokesperson declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b69a29435924481e14913888bd3178fed8fca60c/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29dc6639d37a17d8eea8e7c8fd2871bc","title":"public inquiry into no 10 covid 19 response inevitable kerslake says","story":"Bob Kerslake says lessons will need to be learned as UK may face same situation again The scale of the coronavirus outbreak and the response it has required from government means a large-scale public inquiry is now inevitable, a former head of the civil service has said. Sir Bob Kerslake said the scope of the decision-making undertaken by politicians and officials had been vast, and, as some of it had already been challenged, there would need to be a chance to reflect upon the UK’s response in case of another pandemic.“There will need to be some sort of inquiry after we get through this to learn lessons,” said Lord Kerslake, who is a crossbench peer. “This is one where we might face the same situation again.“I hope that even during this clear crisis moment there is a proper record being kept of who made decisions and why, because that will be very, very important. Not to lay blame – though clearly there will be a bit of that – but to plan for the future. We could face this again and it could be even worse.”Kerslake also warned Downing Street against appointing people with election skills and backgrounds in political messaging over those with the exact skills for the task in hand.His intervention echoes repeated acknowledgments by ministers that their decisions are likely to be scrutinised at a future inquiry and No 10 accepts that this is likely to be on the horizon.A senior Tory source said questions over testing, the government’s initial consideration of herd immunity, ventilator stocks, the way ideas have been briefed to the press, and the delivery of personal protective equipment would all be issues any inquiry might want to look at.They said: “There has to be a public inquiry about how decisions were taken and what was happening beforehand while the virus was still in Wuhan in China. What was the planning, what was flagged to who and when?”An ex-No 10 staffer said no one working on coronavirus from within Downing Street would be overly concerned about a forthcoming inquiry, but they would always have “one eye” on what would be subject to a freedom of information request and any leaks of information, particularly when they involved worst-case scenario planning.Downing Street is said to be urgently bringing trusted people back on board to help deal with the crisis, including Isaac Levido, the head of the Tories’ successful 2019 general election campaign. He has been tasked with improving the party’s public health communications campaign.Tom Shinner, a civil servant who was formerly head of no-deal Brexit planning, has been drafted back into Downing Street to coordinate Whitehall’s response to Covid-19.Kerslake said Shinner had clearly impressed the government over Brexit and that Levido was known for his skills with election communications, but that the job now required a firm grasp of data and science.He said: “This is more about how do you keep the public on side because this requires massive voluntary effort. People have to choose to follow the rules and how do you keep confidence with the public.“The communication task goes beyond producing messaging. If that’s all Levido does, I’m not sure he will add a lot, but if he can recognise the … task that’s needed now and how different it is to an election campaign, then he might bring something to it. If he does a rerun of the election, he’s got it wrong.”A No 10 insider said Shinner was a brilliant civil servant and exactly the right person to work on Covid-19. The senior Tory source said they were worried about the new appointees – particularly Levido – because of their political background.They said: “You need people who understand the logistical challenges. Experts in disaster relief. A lot of these people already exist within government who look after crisis briefs. Winning elections is good but undoubtedly this is different.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41842bcb95383cacfe997f6b4319347ac4cf9b96/0_488_2800_1679/master/2800..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e185c8ba785c84387ecd53fc291cffe","title":"englands cricketers to hand back 500000 and donate to charities","story":"England’s cricketers have announced they will make a donation of £500,000 to their employers and selected charitable causes as the sport continues to grapple with cashflow issues caused by the coronavirus.The money, which comes from the Team England Player Partnership that distributes their pay and bonuses, has been described as “an initial donation” and follows talks led by Joe Root, the Test captain, and Eoin Morgan, his limited-overs equivalent, on Friday.The PCA statement also confirmed that England’s centrally-contracted women’s players have volunteered a three-month salary reduction that, while unspecified, is in line with those taken by their coaches.Heather Knight, the England women’s captain, who has signed up to be an NHS volunteer, said: “All the players felt like it was the right response in the current climate to take a pay cut in line with what our support staff are taking. We know how the current situation is affecting the game and we want to help as much as we can. We will be discussing with the ECB further ways we can help the game in the coming weeks.”The moves by both sets of players are entirely voluntary and come while talks are ongoing between the 18 first-class counties and PCA regarding salary cuts for domestic players. The majority of clubs are understood to be furloughing their squads under the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme.The scale of the issue facing cricket was underlined by the ECB unlocking £40m of emergency funding for the counties this week and making a further £20m available to the recreational game in the form of grants and interest-free loans.Upon announcing this rescue package Tom Harrison, the ECB chief executive, warned that the sport faces the “biggest challenge in its history” and estimated losses in the region of £300m should the entire home season be wiped out by the pandemic.There are, however, plans afoot for matches to be played behind closed doors in what have been labelled “bio-secure” conditions.

It was the best win of her career and, for the audience, a mixture of proud Tunisians and other Arab nationalities scattered around Doha, it was a rare sight of one of their own thriving in this alien sport. And so they chanted her name before, during and after points, cheering endlessly into the night.“It was crazy,” says Jabeur in a phone interview. “It was kind of tough sometimes because they didn’t know the rules of tennis! They thought it was a football match, but it was amazing, seeing all the Tunisians who made the effort to come and see me with all the Tunisian flags … seeing that I had this impact on people following more tennis makes me proud. Not just football, but tennis.”Those scenes – the sight of a player, a female player, trailblazing in real time – may turn out to be the most important moment of the tennis season. The Arab world accounts for around 423 million of the world’s population, yet before Jabeur it had yielded only five top-100 players ever. Four were men. The only Arab woman to reach the top level was Jabeur’s compatriot and friend Selima Sfar, who rose to 75 in the world and made the second round of a handful of grand slams during the early 2000s.Over the past few years, Jabeur has made it her mission to change everything. As she has travelled the WTA Tour, she has carried with her one simple phrase: the first. She was the first Arab woman to reach the third round of a slam, the first to break into the top 50 and the first to reach a WTA final.Still, it was not until this year, at 25 years old, that she began to unlock her potential. She has reached the quarter-finals of the two biggest tournaments this season, the Australian Open and Doha. In Melbourne she beat Britain’s Johanna Konta in the first round and then ended Caroline Wozniacki’s career. In Dubai, she held match points before barely losing to Simona Halep in a manic tussle. Her win over Pliskova in Doha was confirmation she is capable of securing top results. She stands 11th in the 2020 rankings and at a career high of 39 overall.For Jabeur, remaining at home when she was younger meant constantly hearing the laughter and derision of those who would openly tell her that, like most who tried before her, she would never be good enough. “You find these people everywhere,” she says. “They underestimate you. I was a big mouth, I talked, I said I want to win grand slams, and people were laughing and they didn’t believe in me. Some people did believe in me. “One time I had a surgery on my wrist and the first few days when I came back after five months, I couldn’t play tennis. The balls were flying everywhere, no feelings or nothing. People were watching, making fun of me and saying: ‘Yeah, she’s gotta stop tennis.’ But these thoughts make me stronger.”Jabeur was excellent from a young age. In 2011 she became the first Arab woman to win the Roland Garros juniors. It only takes a glimpse of her in action to be blinded by her talent. In an era filled with innumerable flat-hitting baseliners, Jabeur is unique. She throws opponents out of their comfort zone with her wicked, heavy topspin forehand. She flits to the net at all opportunities and peppers her opponents with an unending stream of drop shots. Her toolbox contains every shot and she is desperate to use them all with style. That can sometimes be a problem.Jabeur’s perspective on her game also reflects why she has been able to succeed from such unlikely circumstances. Her strokes are handsome and technically sound, and on the surface they look as if they are the work of a good coach who taught her the correct basics. Her response betrays the single-minded conviction that continues to guide her on a path nobody has trodden before.“I don’t remember someone telling me I should do that,” she says. “I always do whatever suits me. Sometimes a coach would tell me I do too many drop shots. I’d say: ‘Yeah, sure!’ But I never listen. I’m glad I’m forcing my personality because I’m the one playing on the court, I’m the one doing the shots.” For now, her career is out of her hands. One day before tennis officially closed until June, Tunisia cancelled all flights and it left her stranded in Miami.

From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5ecb25629a950ec1606fc45cab4cc715be3917/0_434_1200_720/master/1200..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8b3d950471bac2fd53149df574f4b80","title":"trekking to everest base camp mountain climbing the stairs at home","story":"Virtual expedition team ascends 5,364 metres over five days in indoor mountain climbing challenge April in Nepal usually means thousands of trekkers trudging up to Everest base camp. This spring the mountain is free of crowds but the trekkers are still trudging – up stairs, back steps, even up ladders in a virtual push to reach an altitude of 5,364 metres. Led by trail runner Rory Southworth, a team of about 30 climbers will reach their target this evening after five days of climbing.Southworth decided to organise a group challenge after receiving positive feedback online for three solo hikes during the first week of lockdown. “I did Snowdon on my bottom step Ben Nevis on the seven stairs down to my garden and ran up the hill at the back of my garden 29 times to scale Scafell Pike. For this challenge, I wanted to bring people with me on the journey. There was a lot of negativity among the outdoor community about being confined at home and I wanted to give people a reason to exercise indoors.”Documenting the trek on social media, Southworth has been posting photos of himself fully kitted out while ascending the stairs or eating his dinner in his tent pitched in his living room.He usually completes each daily climb before breakfast but plans to do the final 50 metres with the group on Zoom this evening.Southworth, who hasn’t done the trek in real life, says next week’s challenge is to trek the remaining 3,484 metres to the summit of Everest.The rest of the group have been throwing themselves into the spirit of the challenge, sharing their progress on Twitter. Becky the Traveller tweeted this morning: “It’s the last day of #virtualEBC today, a cooler start but soon warmed up once I started hiking.”Meanwhile, on the real-life mountain, a group of climbers found themselves stranded at base camp when flights in and out of Lukla were cancelled. They have since returned to Kathmandu. “They’d had a lot of snow at base camp and the temperatures were about -15C so it was tough conditions for them to be stranded in. Luckily all the Sherpa guides who works for us know the local families and they were able to offer accommodation and food, they’ve been fantastic,” said Andy, managing director of EverTrek, which organised the trip."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa3b78f8faecfa509c17c1f61ab0464d39bdb49a/0_239_5030_3020/master/5030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8b7aecb09fb1e4af3ee91a1ef68d5c6","title":"send tip favourite travel souvenir win 200 pounds sawdays stay","story":"Tell us about something you picked up on your travels that brings back great memories or takes you back in timeGiven that we’re all stuck at home for who knows how long, our travel memories are especially poignant.

When the story of BBC Radio Light Entertainment is written, the legend of Langdon will feature large, not least because he wrote the famous Week Ending sketch about Derek Jameson (“a man who thinks erudite is a type of glue”) for which the tabloid editor sued the BBC and lost. But to me, he was my best friend, my greatest encourager and, for over 35 years, my constant writing partner.He’d appreciate the irony of now being the late John Langdon, as that was a salient part of his reputation – his inability to deliver scripts on time, or rather, his infallible ability to produce far too many jokes at the very last minute. “Do you want it funny or do you want it Friday?” he’d say, knowing that producers invariably wanted it Friday. But he, equally invariably, managed, through a combination of chaotic genius and perfectionism, to push it into the small hours of Saturday. One producer blamed the break-up of his marriage on the fact that his wife wouldn’t believe him when he insisted he was working late editing John’s scripts and decided he must be having an affair. Barry Cryer would say John was like Brigadoon, the Scottish village that appeared out of the mist one day every 100 years.In the 80s John was a writer on the radio corridor at the BBC, working on weekly satirical shows such as Week Ending and The News Quiz with writers including Dave Cohen, Pete Sinclair, Andy Hamilton and Jeremy Hardy. I think it was Pete or Dave who credited John with “the Langdon”, a joke formula where you introduce two subjects, and switch them at the punchline. For example, Boris Johnson and his girlfriend introduced their new dog to Downing Street yesterday. “He’s a bit scruffy and wants to shag everything that moves, but we’ll get used to him,” said the dog.He wrote whole series of The News Quiz – in the Barry TookSimon Hoggart era - on his own (now there are often three or four credited writers) – usually, as was his style, outside on the pavement, leaning against railings so he could smoke unusual cigarettes and type on a handheld computer or scribble on sheets of paper. Someone contacted me this week to say he remembered John going AWOL while working on Frankie Howerd’s TV show. They found him in a cubicle in the gents’ writing material on a “bakelite microwriter contraption” strapped to his thigh.We were paired up in Edinburgh in 1984. I was doing my first standup show, with Mark Steel and Jenny Eclair, and BBC radio producers Alan Nixon and Jennie Campbell wanted to use my impressions to link highlights from the rest of the Fringe. Jennie introduced us and from that day forward, we were inseparable.Yes, the scripts could be overwritten, a torrential flow of jokes that I told him were like those Indian trains with people hanging off every conceivable door and window. But he taught me everything I know about writing, and as I grew more confident and self-reliant (because sometimes it had to be Friday) he became the best editor and embellisher of my efforts I could wish for. We ended up like a married couple, finishing each other’s sandwiches. (A typical John twist, that. A couple “finishing each other’s sentences” wouldn’t be funny. Unless, like Jack Dee, you make the couple Fred and Rosemary West.)Just weeks before John died, we were writing lines for the tour of I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue and one of our last email exchanges crossed in the ether. Inventing new slogans for companies, we’d each written, unbeknown to the other, “SussexRoyal: Heir today, gone tomorrow.”However good the line, he’d want to make it even better. Asked by Stephen Fry to do a piece at Prince Charles’s 50th, I suggested Dr Dolittle singing, “If I could talk to the vegetables”. (“Imagine talking to a turnip moaning to a mushroom – I could even talk in Swedish – to a Swede!” ) Back came the lines from John: “I’d frater-nize with whole fields of wheat  bend their ears a bit  it’s a-MAIZE-ing just how corny I can be I love to share a hearty joke  with an audience of artichoke  I’m a sort of life and soul of the party bloke  and they all talk to me.” There’s the joy of writing together, right there.Late as he was with scripts, he could be lightning fast with one-liners. Backstage at a Prince’s Trust gala, the great Robin Williams asked him: “What do you say to a prince?” John immediately suggested: “I’m a great fan of yours – I’ve got all your portraits.” Someone once remarked that they hadn’t realised Barry Took was so tall. “That’s because he’s standing on Marty Feldman’s reputation,” John replied. Very unfair, as John immediately acknowledged, but boy, it was quick.Friday nights on Bremner, Bird and Fortune were the best. John and I would madly rewrite my opening monologue as I sat in the make-up chair, with the warm-up comedian already priming the studio audience. With five minutes to go, John would run to give the changes to our long-suffering autocue operator Sarah. As I was introduced with a cheer from the audience, John would jump up and down mouthing “Kill! Kill! Kill!” as I bounded to the microphone and did a few minutes warm-up of my own while the script was typed into the autocue in front of me. When it was finished, I’d sight-read it, humming the voices instead of actually speaking, and then we’d run the opening titles and start recording.That was how we did it. It was all adrenaline, seat-of-the-pants, last-minute writing stuff. Beyond writing, John was the kindest, most generous, least judgmental man you could ever meet. Such was his love of other people that he was the least important person in his life – this often extending to his appearance. Once he arrived on set with severe toothache. I sent him off to the dentist. John came back later that day having had all his top teeth removed, unable to control his top lip or speak as the anaesthetic hadn’t worn off. For months he didn’t have any false teeth fitted, chewing everything – even sandwiches – with his gums, his lack of teeth hidden under his trademark moustache.A while ago, we lost contact for a year or two. I found out it was because he’d been unwell and didn’t want to tell me, as he knew I’d want to put it right, and it couldn’t be put right. In those years he slipped into reclusiveness, editing a magazine about sewing machines of which he became, by default, a huge collector. Luckily we got back in touch and in his final years he wrote wonderful material for me and for Jan Ravens, driven to one show by his devoted wife Ros and carrying his own oxygen supply, the result of the COPD that was ultimately to claim his life.He was writing up to a few weeks before his final relapse, living on oxygen, having lost sight in one eye and having a cataract in the other. There wasn’t a shred of self-pity. He knew his time was up and he’d had an extraordinary, unconventional, complicated, fulfilling life. It was our greatest luck – all of us who worked with him on our shows – that we shared so much of that life with him, doing what we all loved. Making comedy. Oh, how we’ll miss him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b20c79876f99e723f4de01f263d5cce12902d04a/0_61_3500_2101/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7eba75b32936723fcd9f8a97f4e6607a","title":"coronavirus states response who has done least alabama oklahoma missouri","story":"Some states are stubbornly defying expert advice to order residents to stay home – even as cases riseWhile most states in the US have ordered their citizens to stay home as they deal with the coronavirus outbreak, some are stubbornly defying expert advice – even as cases continue to rise.The urgent need for action was made clear on Thursday, when Dr Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, issued a plea for states to force people not to leave their homes.“I don’t understand why it’s not happening,” said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Here are five states who have taken the least action:The deep south state of Alabama has resisted implementing a statewide stay-at-home order, despite it having, as of Friday, 1,270 confirmed coronavirus cases. The lack of action is particularly troubling as Alabama’s population is especially vulnerable to infectious disease. The state had the third-most deaths from flu in 2018.As one of the poorest states in the US, Alabama would be ill-placed to deal with prolonged economic hardship due to the virus. The state’s governor, Kay Ivey, has been evasive when asked about a stay-at-home order. “Each state has to weigh their own set of factors,” she responded during a Q\u0026ampA on Thursday.Ivey has defied Alabama’s US senator, Doug Jones, who has urged officials to act.Arkansas is another southern state yet to order residents to stay at home, despite parts of the state experiencing soaring rates of infection – Cleburne county has 253.7 cases per 100,000 people, among the highest in the nation. Yet while many businesses including gyms and casinos have been ordered to close, some clothing stores remain open, US News reported. Asa Hutchinson, the governor, cited clothing stores on Thursday when he said people could lose their jobs if a wider order was put in place.Reeves finally implemented a stay-at-home order on Wednesday 1 April, after weeks of confusion where the governor overruled cities and towns which had attempted their own orders, then defended his inaction by stating: “Mississippi’s never going to be North Korea”. The order came into effect on Friday.A Wallethub survey which considered each states’ prevention and containment measures to gauge the aggressiveness of their response, ranked Mississippi dead last.Oklahoma has added more than 100 new cases of coronavirus on each of the past four days, but is yet to implement a stay-at-home order. Governor Kevin Stitt has instead ordered a “Safer-At-Home” measure, which asks Oklahomans over 65 or those with a compromised immune system to only leave their homes for essential needs, like food shopping or collecting prescriptions.Epidemiologists have said extending social distancing orders to only the vulnerable, and not the wider population, is not effective. “In my opinion, I cannot shut things down and bunker in place,” Stitt said.Parson did not order schools to close as the seriousness of the coronavirus became apparent, instead leaving it to school districts to decide whether to close. All 555 did so.Some cities in Missouri, including St Louis and Kansas City, have issued their own stay-at-home orders, but leaders there have pleaded with Parson to introduce a statewide measure to prevent spread from rural communities. On Thursday, a column in the Kansas City Star summed up the governor’s lackadaisical response. It was headlined: “Missouri’s Mike Parson in contention for governor who’s done the least to contain Covid-19.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc9c1a2d45d301fa1d44869dae1e5887951425cc/0_34_4358_2616/master/4358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4780726ed8623a5414a001e540a09ded","title":"coronavirus the week explained","story":"Testing strategies in the spotlight ... face masks re-evaluated ... cruise ships still in limboWelcome to our weekly roundup of developments in the coronavirus pandemic. With lockdowns continuing in countries around the world, scientific advances are being made, even as new stumbling blocks appear.A crucial biological mechanism by which the coronavirus infects humans has been unpickedOn Monday, scientists at the University of Minnesota revealed that they have examined the structure of the coronavirus in detail, in particular the spikes on its surface that help it attach to human cells. The results show that the interaction between these spikes and their corresponding receptors on human cells is about four times stronger than was the case for Sars – another coronavirus. That means that when it comes to infection, a little of the new coronavirus goes a long way.Experts say the findings have opened up the possibility of a new target for treatments for Covid-19.The promise of increased testing in the UK has hit a sticking pointAt present Germany is carrying out about 70,000 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests a day – these tests detect genetic material from the virus to reveal who has the infection – and has been held up as an example of good practice, even though there is pressure there to do even more.In Britain, however, progress has been slow and anger is growing. On Wednesday it emerged that just 2,000 out of half a million frontline NHS staff had been tested for the virus.Setting out a new five-point plan to boost testing on Thursday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said PCR testing was expanding in hospitals and other testing facilities, with patients and NHS staff being the top priority. He said the government was aiming for 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, including PCR and antibody tests, the latter indicating who has already had the disease based on blood from a finger-prick.To help with this, commercial laboratories, including universities and private businesses, are pitching in to speed up testing in what has been dubbed a “Dunkirk effort” – an approach many say should have been taken sooner.But the British government is facing several problems, including shortages of chemicals needed to carry out testing, leading experts to call for rules to be relaxed in order for alternatives to be used and the lack of any reliable antibody tests for Covid-19.Humans may wish to include their cat in the lockdownOn Wednesday research from China revealed that infected cats can transmit Covid-19 to other cats, with a similar situation seen between ferrets. While there is no direct evidence the disease passes from cats to humans, a report from Belgium has suggested one owner did pass Covid-19 to their feline friend.By contrast, the team in China found that dogs, chickens, pigs and ducks were unlikely to catch the infection or pass it on to their peers.Experts have advised pet owners to be particularly vigilant about handwashing. To find out more about why soap and water is so effective in tackling coronavirus, tune in to the ’s Science Weekly podcast which has a new episode on the issue, as well as other questions including how the virus may affect pregnant women and how different tests for the infection work.

The Zaandam had last stopped in South America on 14 March and had since been turned away from 11 countries. However, other cruise ships remain in limbo while carrying passengers infected with Covid-19, including the Coral Princess, which is also hoping to dock in Florida. Cruise ships are also in purgatory off the coast of Australia, with many staying put despite being ordered to leave. This week the New South Wales government announced that a military-style operation may be employed to test all cruise ship crew members, with anyone in need of medical attention being evacuated to hospital. They hope the ships will then return to their ports of origin.  Face masks may yet become the accessory du jourSurgical face masks have been deemed to have little effect in protecting iniduals from catching coronavirus in general situations, not least because they are not close-fitting and tiny viral particles can penetrate them, unlike well-fitting masks that have a respirator to filter air, such as FFP3 models.However, surgical masks can catch droplets from coughs and sneezes, suggesting they do offer some protection, and experts say they may help to reduce the transmission of Covid-19 from infected people even before they show symptoms by catching droplets when people talk.This week the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association stressed that staff and patients should wear surgical masks to cover their mouths and reduce the risk of transmission of Covid-19.Now the World Health Organization and the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US are looking into whether wearing surgical masks in public may, after all, help in the fight to tackle the pandemic. Among the reasons for the rethink is the fact that such masks were used in Hong Kong, where containment has proved effective. Bill De Blasio, the mayor of New York City, has asked all residents to wear them outside.In Italy the camaraderie of earlier weeks appears to be giving way to social unrest, with Italians no longer singing or dancing on balconies as dwindling reserves of food and money cause tensions to rise, particularly in poorer regions.Coronavirus continues to hammer all aspects of societySport continues to be battered by the coronavirus: this week it has emerged that sporting bodies in the UK fear they may not survive the outbreak, while financial news is also grim: the Eurozone’s manufacturing and services sectors has revealed the biggest ever single monthly fall in March.While crises can spur incredible developments in science and society, not every attempt is a success. This week a 27-year-old astrophysicist in Melbourne needed medical help in what may be the strangest Covid-19-related hospital admission yet.Playing with powerful neodymium magnets while trying to develop a necklace that buzzed when its wearer touches their face, Dr Daniel Reardon ended up getting the magnets stuck in his nose. “The doctors thought it was quite funny, making comments like: ‘This is an injury due to self-isolation and boredom’,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area map","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

New York suffered its deadliest single day on Friday, with 562 additional deaths across the state for a total of 2,935, Cuomo said, with 102,863 confirmed cases.He warned that people were going to die in the near term due to a lack of ventilators, adding that he would use his authority to take ventilators and protective gear from private hospitals and companies that are not using them. “If they want to sue me for borrowing their excess ventilators to save lives, let them sue me,” Cuomo said.Staff at one Brooklyn medical centre were seen disposing of their protective gear in a street refuse bin after loading bodies into refrigerated trucks. Officials have said between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans could ultimately die from the virus. The US disaster response agency, Fema, has asked the US military for 100,000 body bags.Donald Trump sparked fresh alarm when his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, said the president became concerned about a shortage of vital medical equipment after hearing about it from “friends of his in New York”, suggesting he was responding to anecdotes rather than the state governor or public health officials.The US president drew fresh criticism by deploying Kushner, who is married to his daughter, Ivanka, at a White House coronavirus taskforce briefing. He also accused opposition Democrats, who have said a new congressional committee will oversee “all aspects” of the federal response to the crisis, of launching a “witch-hunt”.According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, more than 1.04 million people have contracted the illness worldwide with more than 55,000 deaths. Nearly half the world’s population is living under some form of confinement in an effort to curb Covid-19.China, where the pandemic originated, has succeeded in stabilising its outbreak, with the number of new domestic – as opposed to imported – transmissions reportedly reduced to zero. Authorities in the city of Wuhan, the initial centre of the outbreak, on Friday began loosening lockdown restrictions imposed in late January.Europe has been the focus of the crisis for the past several weeks, but signs have emerged this week that the epidemic could be approaching its peak there. Italy and Spain together account for almost half of the global death toll, but experts say the number of new infections in both countries is continuing to slow.For the second day running, more than 900 people died in Spain over the past 24 hours, the government said on Friday, but health ministry figures confirmed a consistent downward trend in the rate of both new cases and fatalities. A total of 932 people have died in the past 24 hours, a slight drop from the 950 deaths recorded one day earlier and marking the first decline in the daily death toll this week.In other developments:With airlines largely grounded, businesses closed and unemployment surging, the economic fallout is set to surpass that of the 2008 financial crisis, with some experts comparing it to the Great Depression.The pandemic is also beginning to get a grip on the developing world, where experts have warned of looming disasters among communities with little or no healthcare provision and populations already weakened by poverty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/486a9b8b9c017b00b4a5a03ed3636ac17e70f707/0_133_3974_2385/master/3974..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f442e5709cc05cdaa52f305905496bb7","title":"health secretary says remarks over coronavirus peak over interpreted","story":"Government officials contradict each other over Easter date for highest number of fatalities in the UK The health secretary urgently sought to play down his suggestion that the peak number of deaths caused by coronavirus could fall as early as Easter Sunday – claiming his remarks had been “over interpreted”.Matt Hancock began his media appearances on Friday by saying it was “perfectly possible” the peak of the disease could arrive in nine days’ time.His comment led to confusion hours later at the daily Downing Street press conference as the government’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, asked when the epidemic was expected to peak, said: “We don’t know the answer to that yet.”Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.Van-Tam said it was “too soon to say” when the peak would hit, appearing to contradict the health secretary.“It will partly depend upon how well those social distancing measures are adhered to by every one of us,” he said. “I hope it will be soon. We’re going to watch very carefully to see when we’ve hit the peak and when we’re starting to turn it, but we will not take any premature actions.”Easter Sunday falls on 12 April this year, and Hancock had earlier said he would not steer people away from anticipating that date as the peak in the number of fatalities in the UK, though there was still uncertainty around it.He clarified his remarks during the Downing Street press conference on Friday evening after being asked again by Sky News when he thought the peak would fall. “The truth is that we don’t know,” he said.He claimed his remarks had been over interpreted and he had been clear that the government could not give a definitive answer in his earlier interviews.He said: “Actually, there’s a reason we don’t know, and that’s because it depends on how people act, and this is why the absolute central message, the most important message that anybody can take away from this press conference or the entirety of the government’s messaging and how we feel, is that you’ve got to stay at home.”It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 31 March, more than one million people have been infected in more than 170 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 50,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 13,900 fatalities, and there have been over 10,000 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 245,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 210,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, said Hancock’s 12 April suggestion did not feel accurate considering the evidence she had assessed. She said: “I want to be very clear that nothing I have seen gives me any basis whatsoever for predicting the virus will peak as early as a week’s time here in Scotland.”Her chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, stressed: “I have not been able to find that the peak will be as soon as we’re hearing in the media today. Now is not the time to think that perhaps it will all be over soon.”Several government ministers have come under fire for giving mixed messages to the public, including the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, who incorrectly said people should only go shopping for food once a week, which was later corrected by No 10.Michael Gove also stepped in to explain that daily exercise should be a walk or run close to home after people had interpreted the government’s rule as allowing them to travel further afield.The prime minister has also been criticised for talking about plans for up to 250,000 tests a day. The health secretary confirmed the immediate aim was 100,000 tests a day by the end of April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdd56154364a6bddcd37ec1edf6e331f40df3710/0_104_2100_1260/master/2100..jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=16c54e171d7c2688511bc4c7ae74e453","title":"ploughing through coronavirus news for the brighter stories","story":"The Upside succumbs to coronavirus positivity: silver linings, survivor stories and funny interludesLast week we began with a paradox.

These are PCR (polymerase chain reaction) swab tests, sometimes called antigen tests, which need to be processed with specialised kits in a lab.Testing for Covid-19 has increased and exceeded a previous target of 10,000 per day, though later than the government initially promised.Hancock’s bigger goal of carrying out 100,000 tests in England by the end of the month includes antibody tests – the fingerprick blood test that could be done at home. Hancock said he had bought 3.5m test kits and is known to have ordered millions more from nine companies, but the first tests to be put through validation at Oxford University have failed.On Friday, after the latest figures revealed a further 684 people with the virus had died in the UK, Hancock said he was “absolutely determined to hit the new goal”.But when asked about the IBMS warning at the Downing Street press conference, he acknowledged: “Yes, that will involve some challenges, there’s no doubt, including making sure we get hold of all of the parts and all of the reagents. And everybody can see there are challenges around the world.”Allan Wilson, the IBMS president, said he did not understand the strategy. “Mixing antibody and antigen tests doesn’t add up to me,” he said. “We don’t have an antibody test that is any use at this stage so how can you include that in the 100,000 and not say what the mix within that 100,000 is of antibody and antigen tests? It’s just a bit of a muddle still.”Wilson, the lead biomedical scientist in cellular pathology at his NHS trust, says they could deliver 100,000 tests for the virus every day – but only if they got the supplies that are currently either available only in tiny quantities or non-existent.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.There are shortages of the test kits themselves, “but also of some very basic reagents, such as the virology transport medium that we need to put the swabs in. The actual swabs are in short supply – effectively they are rationed in my patch in Scotland but I know there are problems in England as well.”The lysis buffer, used in extracting the RNA of the virus, was “in very, very short supply”, he said. So are precision plastics – “the little tubes and pipettes, so each test gets its own inidual tube”. Those will not be available until mid-May.“This is affecting countries across the world and there is nothing more the workforce can do to increase testing capacity any further,” said the institute in its statement. “We would urge caution as testing is ramped up to ensure that the supply chain is secured.“The very real risk is that hospitals and pathology networks will run out of reagents and patients will not be able to be tested and this will not only impact upon their care but can lead to hospitals unable to manage all patients safely as has been seen in other countries.”Charlie Swanton, the chief clinician of Cancer Research UK, who is turning the whole of the Francis Crick Institute into a testing lab, supports the government scaling-up of testing. However, he said his team were experiencing difficulties in obtaining test kits and even getting space on planes to have them delivered.“We have some tests. We haven’t got enough yet,” he said. “We hope to secure our supply chain. We just need to get that in the institute building and then we will be happier. We don’t want to have to suddenly change the test three weeks from now. It is a constant worry. You’d be amazed how many blocks to the supply chain there are even in a simple diagnostic assay like this.”Swanton, too, spoke of a global shortage of lysis buffer. “And then to make matters worse, because all the airlines have grounded their planes, there is no cargo space. So we’re having to solve all these problems. It’s like marshalling a small army. It’s been very tough.“The other big problem is that we are competing, not just nationally but internationally for access to these reagents – and competing is a horrible term because we are all trying to help the same people. We’ve got to be very conscious of that in the UK, that we’re not depriving other hubs and other laboratories. But we hope to be able to share what we can.”A handful of big companies, mostly based in the US, supply test kits for the virus with emergency approval from regulators in the US or EU. They include the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche, which has been in discussions with Public Health England (PHE) and is thought to be central to the plans for mass-testing in a new mega-lab in Milton Keynes.Roche, credited with enabling up to 500,000 tests a week in Germany, has already opened three labs for PCR swab testing in Manchester, London and Gateshead, it emerged on Friday. It plans to open at least six more in the coming weeks for Public Health England with a lab in Wales opening on Monday and Northern Irish and Scottish sites to follow.The government said on Friday it was already operating five testing sites for health workers including one in Boots headquarters in Beeston in Nottingham, and would expand the number of mostly drive-in sites to 50 in the coming weeks.Doris Ann Williams, the CEO of the British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, said Johnson was himself calling the companies to try to increase UK supplies of testing kits.“The pinch point is availability from the manufacturers of PCR test kits needed to work on their dedicated instrumentation. The prime minister is intervening with the global heads of the companies involved to understand when they may be able to supply more test kits,” she said.The manufacturers were doing all they could, she said. “However, there is global demand and manufacturing capacity is being increased at pace, along with the logistics to distribute it but none of this can be achieved overnight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6662741ebb28f4887c668f345f713e9674dd4d4/56_0_2652_1592/master/2652..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f58b23b22c3e6586e2fc90c0ddfb3031","title":"uk promises first coronavirus repatriation flights from india next week","story":"Announcement from Delhi embassy comes after criticism of government for failing to actThousands of British nationals stranded in India after the country went into coronavirus lockdown are to be flown home on charter flights that will begin next week, the Foreign Office has said.The high commissioner in Delhi, Jan Thompson, made the late-night announcement on social media after days of criticism that the British government was not doing enough to get people out of a country where restrictions have triggered food shortages and been enforced with police brutality.“Special charter flights from India to the UK organised by the British government will start next week,” she said. “We are still in the process of finalising details with the Indian government and airlines.“Next week is just the start. We will not be able to get everyone home immediately so please bear with us.”The priority would be to get the most vulnerable home first, she said. India has been one of the top priorities for the government’s £75m coronavirus rescue operation announced by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, on Monday.The British ambassador in Kathmandu has also confirmed that there will be flights next week from Nepal, where an estimated 700 Britons are stranded.Britain’s embassies around the world have been criticised for the government’s failure to act sooner. Germany has rescued 30 times as many people as the UK since global travel restrictions started three weeks ago.There is growing concern that Britons in Thailand could be marooned after the embassy in Bangkok advised tourists who intended to return home to make plans to do so immediately, after the country started closing down domestic travel routes and shutting some provincial borders.“This disruption is likely to last for some time so if you decide to remain in Thailand you should plan for this and make sure you have enough money, somewhere to stay and access to healthcare,” the embassy said in a tweet.Like Australia, Argentina, New Zealand and Sri Lanka, Thailand is not on the UK’s priority list for charter flights.There was also anger in Pakistan where stranded Britons are being encouraged to buy seats for about £1,000 on the dwindling number of commercial flights leaving the country.“How are families with four up to 10 family members able to afford tickets that are being sold for £800+. These do not sound like repatriation flights,” said Tabassum Niamat.There are thought to be at least 600 Britons, including senior NHS staff, trapped in Pakistan and struggling to get on flights even if they have the money because they are often cancelled, even after being flagged by the local embassy.Others have complained they may not be able to get to the airport because of the lockdown and police checks.One woman in the UK who has family in the country said: “Charter flights with a capped price have been sent to many other countries. Yet British Pakistanis are being left stranded,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:At least 58,773 people across the world have now died as a result of the pandemic, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The number of confirmed cases passed a million on Thursday and at least 1,094,068 people are now known to have been infected.The true scale of the outbreak is likely to be greater due to suspected underreporting by some nations.It was confirmed that 684 more people have died in UK hospitals, bringing the total to 3,605 and making the 24 hours to 5pm on Thursday (BST) the deadliest since the outbreak began.The country’s Department of Health and Social Care says 173,784 people have been tested of whom 38,168 were positive.The number of deaths on Friday was relatively steady, when compared to those seen the previous day. But the rate of new infections continues to slow, raising hopes of turnaround. Some 85,388 people are currently infected, with an increase of 2,339 new cases 138 fewer than Thursday.Italy remains the world’s worst-hit country, having suffered a total of 14,681 deaths.The Falkland Islands government confirmed the island territory’s first case. The patient has been hospitalised since 31 March and developed a range of Covid-19 symptoms, tested positive for the virus, and is now in a stable condition and being cared for with necessary isolation procedures.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending that Americans cover their faces when outside, the White House says. But the US president, Donald Trump, repeatedly undermines the guidance, saying: “I’m choosing not to do it.”Trump says such guidelines are not meant for “presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens”. Meanwhile, his wife Melania implores Americans to take the guidance seriously.The number of cases detected in Egypt jumped to 985, the country’s health ministry said. It announced 120 new cases and eight more deaths, bringing the total number of fatalities to 66.Biomedical scientists and National Health Service laboratory staff expressed “frustration” at a lack of resources preventing them from carrying out larger numbers of tests.Meanwhile, there are demands for better protection for the UK’s healthcare workers following the deaths of two nurses in their 30s, while another frontline worker quit her job after being forbidden from wearing a face mask.Police surround Geneva’s main prison after some 40 prisoners refused to return to their cells from their daily walk, complaining about measures taken due to the pandemic.The scale of the coronavirus outbreak and the response it has required from the UK government means a large-scale public inquiry is now inevitable, a former head of the country’s civil service has said.Albania reported 27 new cases – its second biggest daily increase – and ordered a third 40-hour lockdown over the weekend to halt the spread of the highly contagious pathogen that has killed 17 in the country so far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

But not all planes are grounded. We’ve taken a look at the available data to find out who is still flying.A  analysis of Flightradar24 data showed that the number of aircraft transmitting location information and reporting an altitude of more than 50ft had dropped by more than half last week compared to a typical March week last year.Flightradar24 doesn’t record all commercial flights and conversely it tracks some non-commercial aircraft, but the numbers are in line with other data sources.Despite far-reaching travel restrictions in many countries, thousands of flights are still taking off from airports every day. In the early days of the outbreak, many airlines continued to operate near-empty “ghost flights” to comply with airport slot regulations. These rules require airlines to operate at least some connections at any given time to guarantee they will keep their landing slots in the future.They have since been relaxed in many legislations, including in the EU which announced on 10 March that it would temporarily suspend slot usage obligations.But the main reason thousands of planes remain in the air is that governments have been reluctant to restrict domestic air travel.At a White House briefing on Wednesday, President Trump said his administration was considering restrictions on flights between the worst-hit areas of the country.One of the few countries to suspend all domestic flights was India, where health experts worry a big jump in coronavirus cases could be imminent.The large drop in air traffic is expected to lead to a temporary dip in greenhouse gas emissions. Before the coronavirus outbreak, carbon emissions from aviation had been rising consistently, roughly doubling between 1990 and 2019.Environmental campaigners are demanding that bailout packages for struggling airlines include provisions for large emissions cuts. But last week, the US Senate passed a $60bn relief package with no stipulations on climate action.In the UK, 26 campaign groups including Greenpeace, Flight Free, the IPPR and New Economics Foundation thinktanks, and Tax Justice wrote to the chancellor on Wednesday saying that any support package must set conditions to “reorientate the industry towards helping to meet the Paris climate agreement.”One effect of the coronavirus crisis has yet to be felt. Under the carbon offsetting scheme adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization – known as Corsia – airlines will have to make up for their future emissions by investing in forests, renewable energy or other carbon-cutting projects.Before the coronavirus crisis unfolded, airlines pushed for average emissions in the years 2019 and 2020 to be used as the baseline by which future emissions would be judged.However, with the disruption from the Covid-19 pandemic, this baseline looks set to be drastically lower than anticipated. Thus, if the scheme goes ahead without changes, Corsia’s future carbon targets will be much tougher than envisaged."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Nick BradshawUp to 600 private-only medical consultants are in legal limbo and cannot practise due to unintended consequences of the State’s agreement to effectively take over private hospitals during the coronavirus crisis, doctors have said.Dr Stephen Fröhlich, managing partner of Critical Care Partners (CCP), a practice of 14 consultant anaesthesiologists and intensivists who run the 15- bed intensive care unit at Beacon Hospital, said private-sector specialists had been essentially furloughed.He said the State anticipated using this ICU unit given the need for intensive care beds in the face of a surge of patients with Covid-19. However, he said that “without the new contracts, none of the consultants who run the ICU can work”.The Government has proposed that on foot of its deal to take over 19 private hospitals for three months to deal with the Covid-19 crisis, consultants in the private sector should be offered a temporary locum contract. They would see only public patients and would be paid a salary of €141,000-€195,000 per year.It is understood private hospitals have now signed the heads of agreement reached with the Government to allow the State to take over their 2,000 beds, theatres and other facilities to assist in dealing with the coronavirus crisis.Dr Fröhlich said on Friday the Government’s deal had seen it essentially take over “the bricks and mortar” of the hospitals. He said no agreements had been reached with the consultants who worked in these facilities.Proposed contractsOn Friday the Irish Hospital Consultants Association urged members practising fully in the private sector for the moment not to sign the proposed contracts.In a memo to members the association said “a large number of very significant issues” regarding the proposed contracts for whole-time private consultants as well as practice terms had not been clarified despite talks with the Department of Health on Wednesday.Dr Fröhlich said without new contracts or indemnification there was no way to practise on public patients and the private sector had effectively, albeit temporarily, shut down.“As a result there are currently an estimated 600 fully private consultants who cannot practise. They have been told clearly by their insurers that they cannot touch patients without indemnification from the State.” He anticipated the Government would move to deal with the indemnity issue.The State Claims Agency said in new advice to IHCA members on Friday that consultants in full-time private practice who have signed the locum contract with the HSE would be covered by its clinical indemnity scheme in relation to the treatment of public patients .A spokeswoman for the IHCA last night said its advice to members not to sign the proposed new contract stood, pending the receipt of clarification on a number of issues from the Department of Health.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4220376.1585944860!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus hse confirms no joint order for ppe with northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere have been concerns in the North about the lack of PPE equipment for health workers, as well as tensions between Sinn Féin and the other parties over how to handle the coronavirus crisis. Photograph: Getty ImagesAn order of personal protective equipment (PPE) from China which the North’s Minister for Finance, Conor Murphy, announced had been made jointly with the Irish Government has not been placed. Mr Murphy told reporters on March 27th that a “very significant order” for PPE had been made. “We have the agreement with Dublin to jointly pursue this. We have the order placed.” However, the Department of Health in Dublin said on Friday it “has not so far proved possible to place a joint order”.Speaking at a press briefing, Dr Colm Henry, HSE chief clinical officer, said he was not aware of any joint PPE procurement between the Republic and the North. Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said if his counterpart in the North “identified a particular need...we’d be happy to work with them, as we do on many issues”. Mr Murphy, a Sinn Féin MLA, clarified his position on Friday evening, explaining that it had been “agreed that orders would be placed through North-South collaboration” on March 27th, and that day his department “provided our detailed requirements for PPE to Dublin, and payment arrangements were in train”. “However, over that weekend the market was upended when major economic powers entered the global race for PPE. Yesterday afternoon, despite best efforts of all involved, I received confirmation that the order would not in fact be fulfilled through this route,” he said. Irish Government sources said there had been discussions about procuring a joint order in China, and that this had fallen through when “bigger players” entered the market. In its statement the Department of Health said it was “ready to discuss any area where we can co-operate effectively, North and South, including on procurement of PPE and critical supplies”. Procurement teams“In relation to procurement, while it has not so far proved possible to place a joint order in the context of what is an increasingly challenging international environment, discussions between procurement teams are ongoing and active, and it remains our intention to continue to co-operate in this area.”There have been concerns in the North about the lack of PPE equipment for health workers, as well as tensions between Sinn Féin and the other parties over how to handle the coronavirus crisis. On Thursday, the Deputy First Minister, Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill, said the North’s Minister for Health, Robin Swann, had been “too slow to act”. The UK health minister, Matt Hancock, has announced that the North is to receive 5 million items of PPE from British stocks.

Photograph: Vivek PrakashAFP via Getty ImagesShould we all be wearing face masks during the pandemic?Current World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations are that face masks are of use in clinical situations and may also prevent the spread of disease if worn when someone has a cough or coronavirus symptoms.In short, members of the public are advised not to wear one unless they are sick with coronavirus or caring for someone who is. This is based on there being no specific evidence to suggest the mass wearing of masks has any potential benefit. There are anxieties about incorrect fits and false reassurance for iniduals wearing them, not to mention the global shortage of masks for those at the healthcare front line.Is there a shift to advising everybody to wear masks in public?Two factors are prompting some re-evaluation by the WHO – new unpublished evidence from Hong Kong on viral spread, and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – arguably the world’s second most influential public health agency – flagging a need for change.US case numbers are doubling every two to three days and CDC concerns have been heightened by “a significant amount of asymptomatic spread” – people with no obvious symptoms infecting others.Put simply, one or two days before symptoms develop, a person may be contagious and spreading the virus. CDC data shows high rates of transmission by people who are infected but do not know it yet.An infected person may not develop any symptoms at all and masks could reduce transmissions from this cohort.Is asking billions of people to wear face masks an impossible ask?The CDC has been quick to underline it’s not going to be advising everybody to get their hands on high-grade “N95” medical masks, an essential piece of personal protection equipment (PPE) for front-line workers that is already scarce.For this purpose, ordinary surgical masks and even home-made masks will do as a last resort. They will help slow transmission in the community, though they don’t ensure complete protection for wearers.There’s a side benefit, wearing any kind of mask, even a scarf, makes you less likely to touch your face – an important infection control measure.What level of protection can home-made masks offer?Understandably, home-made masks are not as effective as medical-grade ones. Wearing a home-made mask will not guarantee protection against coronavirus, also known as Covid-19. Their effectiveness is better when combined with regular hand-washing, physical distancing, self-isolation and cocooning.Researchers have evaluated a range of household materials that in the event of a pandemic serves as a DIY guide. They found T-shirts and pillowcases made into a mask can act as a barrier against influenza, or help limit spread by a person with symptoms. There are many online guides to making masks. It can be as simple as using a folded piece of cotton and two elastic bands. But infectivity risk demands that masks are put on and taken off correctly.What will the WHO be factoring in as it weighs up its advice?The WHO is facing into an arduous evaluation of latest evidence, logistics and the risk that altering its stance may shift focus in the wrong way in the Covid-19 battle.Masks themselves can become a virus spreader when they become saturated with breath condensation, and they don’t protect against coronavirus getting into the eye.The WHO will also have to factor in cultural differences. In countries like China and Singapore masks are a norm for those with respiratory disease symptoms and at times of epidemics. The current emergency has exacerbated discriminatory behaviour towards those who wear masks as a precaution from people who associate masks with infection.The most telling factor prompting change, however, is likely to be indication that droplets may be projected much farther into the air than previously thought – 6m (20ft) for a cough and up to 8m (26ft) for a sneeze."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4219888.1585916626!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus situation in ireland misrepresented because of limited testing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Jack Lambert of the Mater hospital in Dublin speaking to the Confronting Coronavirus podcastDelays in testing for Covid-19 are leading to patients being treated late and pressures on intensive care, a leading infectious disease consultant has said.Some patients who have been deteriorating at home for up to a week while waiting for a test have ended up intubated in intensive care units (ICU), said Dr Jack Lambert of the Mater hospital in Dublin.“This is a virus that you can be short of breath one day, and you can be intubated the next day and in near death. It’s a very rapid progression of disease of some people, especially the elderly and immunocompromised, and that’s scary. This is something that none of us clinicians have ever seen before.”The scope of the epidemic in Ireland was being “misrepresented” by a reliance on figures based on limited testing, Dr Lambert said.“How can you talk about flattening the curve where you’re testing such small numbers of people and people are queuing up to get testing?”“And then there’s results that are pending for a week, so the numbers represent our lack of supplies for testing rather than flattening the curve.”Significant exposureUpscaling of testing was urgently needed in order to flatten the curve, he said. “And then as soon as those test results are available, which should be in 24 hours, you contact trace everyone who has had a significant exposure.”“South Korea and Singapore and many of the other countries have been able to flatten the curve didn’t do it just by putting people in isolation and reporting numbers. They did it by testing and very strict contact tracing. That’s what we need to be doing.”Dr Lambert said a “master plan” was needed in order to “win the war” on coronavirus.“You can’t fight one battle more than another battle. You have to have a master plan and fight all of the battles in parallel. The testing plan. The shutdown plan. The contact tracing plan. The community plan, as so on.”Dr Lambert said that while Ireland is “way ahead” of other European countries, and “ahead of the game” in some respects, actions in some situations were being taken “a day too late”.“If you don’t scale up (testing) you’ll just have to shut down and shut down and shut down.”Meanwhile, emergency medicine consultants believe the expected surge in critically infected patients requiring places in ICU could hit Irish hospitals swiftly based on the experiences of hospitals in London and Italy.“It can happen very quickly,” said University Hospital Limerick intensive care physician Dr Catherine Motherway, who is president of the Intensive Care Society.She said the experience in Italy was of cases coming “like a wave”.“It was like nothing they had ever seen before. That’s how quickly a surge can happen,” said Dr Motherway, though she added that medics in Italy did not know Covid-19 was in the community for some time. “They saw a few patients with respiratory failure and then a few more and then it happened and it happened very quickly.”AmbulanceDr Motherway said one Dublin hospital, running at twice its normal capacity, experienced a surge in critically ill patients requiring ICU beds earlier this week, but managed the surge by transferring affected patients elsewhere by ambulance. She said this scenario had been managed “very appropriately and we are still in a place where we can do that”.Dr Emily O’Conor, president of the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine, said that ICU beds would fill up quickly when the Covid-19 surge hits the health system.“When a hospital experiences a surge, it is inclined to happen very quickly it is a patient suffering respiratory failure followed by another followed by another,” said Dr O’Connor, an emergency medicine consultant at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown, Dublin.“It is trying to pace the curve and reduce the amount of people who get sick. We are hoping that it is not happening very quickly. We are still planning for those scenarios.”Dr O’Connor said that Letterkenny Hospital in Co Donegal “went through a difficult period” at one point and that Beaumont Hospital in Dublin and Limerick “have been under significant pressure on their ICU capacity”.Inter-hospital transfers would help ease pressure, she said.“That is still happening. It is as the capacity gets full that it is going to be more difficult,” she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Changes include a more dominant civil service and the idea of \u0026lsquodesignated survivors\u0026rsquoCountries with high BCG vaccination rates have fewer coronavirus deaths, study showsMeasures aim to \u0026lsquodouble down\u0026rsquo on clusters of disease now reported in 38 residential homesAgreement to take over private hospitals inadvertently leaves many unable to practiseSources say shared shipment from China fell through when \u0026lsquobigger players\u0026rsquo entered marketStudent\u0026rsquos parents and brother address court at sentencing hearing of teenage defendantSpace station passing overhead is just one of several celestial events in the coming daysSupplements key to adequate intake during pandemic in the absence of sun exposureSome items in weekend personal protection equipment (PPE) consignment \u0026lsquonot suitable\u0026rsquo, HSE confirmsElderly man does not understand importance of \u0026lsquococooning\u0026rsquo, hand-washing and social distancingCourt heard her risk of contracting the virus in hospital has \u0026lsquosignificantly\u0026rsquo increasedEquipment said to cost \u0026euro200m as Chinese ambassador says all must work in \u0026lsquospirit of cooperation\u0026rsquoJudge says the law of the land is not based on HSE directivesMore than 15,000 third-level students sign petitions about challenges in working onlineMaurice Power had been found guilty of murder of Shane Rossiter after house partyHome methadone deliveries are among new HSE guidance issued to drug workersScattered showers, hazy sunshine and cloud are all forecast for this weekendStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4220073.1585922992!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus organic fruit and veg supplier sees orders rise sharply","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBeechlawn Organic  Farm co-founder Pádraig Fahy with a box of vegetables for delivery. Photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyAn organic fruit and vegetable supplier in Co Galway has temporarily closed its home delivery service to new customers after orders quadrupled because of the Covid-19 crisis.Ballinasloe company Beechlawn Organic Farm is set to grow its workforce by a fifth, adding that growers will have to increase production to fill gaps created by production falls in Italy and Spain. “It has been incredibly hectic,” said company co-founder Pádraig Fahy, adding that orders grew by half the day after schools were closed, while online sales grew sharply in the days that followed.“We supply supermarkets and restaurants, but the home delivery part of our business has exploded. It has basically tripled or probably quadrupled in size,” he said.Isolation and social distancing rules are being followed as supplies are dropped off at a customer’s door: “We are getting calls from people who are in isolation, asking for us to drop the veg box outside,” said Mr Fahy.Hiring staff in the Covid-19 environment brings its own challenges: “We can’t exactly interview for new staff at the moment, so a lot of staff who worked for us before have come back and we’ve drafted family into help,” said Mr Fahy.Saying that Beechlawn was running “over-capacity”, Mr Fahy said they were feeling the loss of three Bulgarian colleagues who returned home for breaks and now could not return.“They were meant to come back last week but that’s not going to happen. This is going to be a big challenge for a lot of veg growers who employ foreign staff in a month’s time.” Grown in IrelandTwo-thirds of Beechlawn’s produce is grown in Ireland – on its own Co Galway farm or from eight other Irish growers – but it is already having difficulties sourcing produce from abroad.“We are doing okay at the moment. We are still going through all the root vegetables – a lot of parsnips, beetroot, leeks, cabbages, potatoes. We still have about a month’s supply on hand,” said Mr Fahy.However, he said organic imports were falling away already. “We don’t know what’s going to happen in Italy and Spain. Southern Europe feeds northern Europe, and there are going to be some issues in those countries.“Ireland is right at the end of this supply line, so who knows what might happen.

Photograph: Aidan CrawleyEPA.I have to wash my shopping now, do I?As the scale of the coronavirus crisis has deepened at home and abroad restrictions on daily life have become more intense. One of the few places people can now go is their supermarket. But people have been advised to go much less frequently than in the past. There has been much more focus on just how safe these places are and there are controls on how many people can enter shops to allow for social distancing. Measures are also being taken to sanitise them more deeply.That’s all good then?Yes, it is. But is it enough? Several days ago, a video appeared on YouTube from a US doctor in which he showed people how to decontaminate their shopping. Dr Jeffrey J Vanwingen asked people to imagine their groceries were covered in glitter - except the glitter is coronavirus. Dr Vanwingen then methodically cleaned his shopping in a video that ran to more than seven minutes. Within days it had been watched by more than 20 million people.Is what he was saying true? The “disregard of hygiene standards” in some shops was highlighted by the Irish Global Health Network (IGHN). “We know that the virus can survive on hard surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 hours,” one of its environmental health specialists Niall Roche said. “It can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours. Supermarkets should adhere to the same guidance and practices that are being exercised in healthcare facilities, particularly for vulnerable shoppers.” Was there more? There was. The IGHN, in partnership with the Environmental Health Association of Ireland and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health in the UK released a set of guidelines for shoppers which they hoped would help slow the spread of Covid-19.These guidelines set out a number of protocols to help the public protect themselves while at the shops. They advised people to use their non-dominant hand to pick up goods to reduce the cross-contamination risk from touching of the mouth, nose or eyes and said contactless payments should be made where possible.The guidelines also said that because the virus can live on surfaces - shopping trolleys, baskets, pin pads, and other regularly touched items - they should be sanitised after each use.Yes. People were advised to reduce the frequency of shopping trips and only go when absolutely necessary and should avoid taking children to shops if possible and visit off-peak. They were encouraged to assess the infection control measures in local shops. How could they do that?Among the measures the groups said people should look out for were controls of the entry and exit of customers, the cleaning and sanitising of trolleys and baskets between use and the provision of hand sanitisers at entrances . The guidelines said best practise mandated there should be clear marking on floors to help customers maintain social distance and messages via posters and public address systems reminding customers and staff to maintain social distance.Staff should also be practising social distancing on the shop floor and cleaning critical contact areas. The group also said baked goods should be covered to protect from sneezes and coughs. So far so sensible. What else? Consumers were advised to wash their hands immediately after returning home and take great care when packing goods away. Prior to stocking fridges and cupboards, shelves should be wiped with sanitiser and a paper towels and as coronavirus can survive on hard surfaces, the outside of all cannedhard surface pack goods should be wiped with a paper towel and warm soapy water,An alternate option would be to leave non-perishable foods in a safe place for 72 hours. Remove outer food packaging and discard, being careful to limit handling of the inner packaging of items such as yoghurts.Is that extreme? Do I really need to wash all my shopping?Well, associate professor of virology at Trinity College Kim Roberts is unconvinced. She is one of Ireland’s leading microbiologists and says the risk of bringing coronavirus into your home on your shopping is low. She says the more serious risks are associated with actually travelling to the shops - particularly on public transport and in touching high-touch surfaces in shops such as doors, trollies, freezer handles and the rest. She says the chances that a particular box of cereal or tin that you touch will have been sneezed on directly and will have, as a result a sufficiently high level of the virus to transmit it to the person who touches it next are very low.Does that mean transmission that way is impossible?No, it is possible. But she says it is important to assess and manage risk in this crisis. Does Dr Roberts wash her shopping? No, she does not. Is there any other advice out there?There is indeed. “Currently, there is no evidence that Covid-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging,” says Ireland’s food safety watchdog Safefood. It adds that now - as ever - it is important to follow good hygiene practices when handling or preparing foods. Does Safefood have specific coronavirus advice? It does. When you go food shopping, you should wash your hands before you leave the house, avoid touching your face when you’re out and follow social distancing. When you come home, you should wash your hands straight away. Wash them again once you have unpacked and put away your shopping.It says it is not necessary to sanitise the outside of food packaging. “While there is some evidence that the virus can survive on hard surfaces, the risk from handling food packing is very low and there is no evidence that the illness can be transmitted in this way,” is its advice. So should I put my food into quarantine?Not according to Safefood. “You should always put away your shopping as soon as you get home, especially perishable foods which must be stored in the fridge or freezer.” On this point the authority was in agreement with Dr Vanwingen who felt compelled to release a sequel to his first video reminding people of this fact. What else do I need to know? Oh, yes, should I wear gloves when shopping?Here’s the thing. A healthcare professional in a healthcare setting has to wear gloves to protect themselves and to protect patients. And the gloves can make a huge difference. But the jury is out when it comes to the general public using them to buy their groceries. Coronavirus can not penetrate your skin and you will not get it if is on your skin. It has to enter your body through the nose, mouth or eyes. If you wear gloves and are careful not to touch your face while wearing them and remove them carefully and dispose of them carefully as soon as you have moved away from the high risk high touch areas, then they may be okay. But if you allow the gloves to give you a false sense of security and are careless with them, they could actually be doing more harm than good.What about face masks?If this question had been asked of us two weeks ago we would have said a definitive no as all the official guidance, in Ireland and internationally, was saying masks were of limited benefit away from specialised health settings and could even be counterproductive when handled by people who don’t know what they are doing. And let’s face it that is all of us who are not working in healthcare. Yet, given the lack of definitive knowledge about how coronavirus is spread, many experts now argue that something is better than nothing, and masks may play a role, alongside social distancing and hand hygiene.Right now the World Health Organisation and US regulators are mulling a change of their guidelines in relation to masks. Countries such as Austria and the Czech Republic have made the wearing of masks compulsory in public - notably in shops. Countries in Asia where mask-wearing is common say it has helped to stem the spread.Should I stop using recycled shopping bags?There are some schools of thought that suggest bags for life should not be used in this time of extreme crisis. But the reality is that the bags in your home are probably less exposed to the virus than the bags in the shop. The act of bringing them to the shop does not make them more dangerous. You could safely disinfect bags for life before and after use or if they are fabric you could wash them at 60 degrees but that would be more for peace of mind than anything else.What about when it comes to paying, should I pay in cash?No. Ideally you want to limit all physical interactions with other people. The best way to pay is by tapping and using a contactless debit or credit card. This has limits - contactless can only be used up to a maximum of €50 in some stores although the limit is €30 in Tesco. Apple and android pay can sometimes be used for larger sums although many people don’t have that facility - Bank of Ireland, for example, has still not rolled it out to its customers. After that the next option is chip and pin. And then cash. It is incredibly important that no matter what mode you use to pay you keep washing your hands but it is even more important you wash or sanitise your hands if using keypads or handling cash.Should I avoid using a trolley?It is hard to do a weekly shop - and it is very important that you reduce the number of trips to the supermarket - without a trolly. Ideally supermarket staff will be cleaning the trollies regularly. But if they are not you should, where possible, sanitise them yourself and then wash your hands as soon as you can. And do not touch your face. We have said it before and will say it again. The virus cannot enter your system through your skin so if you keep your hands away from your face and keep them clean you are helping to keep yourself safe.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4220360.1585944460!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"international space station returns to irish skies on friday and saturday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA view of the city lights at the intersection of Europe and Asia as  the International Space Station orbits above, in March 2020.

It will pass close to Sirius, which is easily spotted in the southwest sky as it is the brightest star. It is under the constellation of Orion. The ISS will be accompanied by another celestial treat which can be spotted nearby. The planet Venus will be in alignment with a star formation called the Pleiades or Seven Sisters, which is diagonally opposite Sirius in the far corner of the constellation of Orion. The Pleiades looks like a hazy cloud studded by six stars visible to the naked eye. It was dubbed the Seven Sisters as the Greeks could apparently see seven stars in the formation. The giant star formation area is also known by its Japanese name, Subaru. The Subaru car manufacturer’s logo is inspired by it. The full glory of the conjunction of Venus and the Pleiades can best be seen in dark skies away from built-up areas and through a pair of binoculars, though it should still be visible to everybody if the skies are clear. Venus will be at its brightest between 8pm and 10pm in the coming nights. As well as all this, on Monday at about 5am the planets Jupiter, Saturn and Mars will all be in the southeastern sky. Anybody up that early should look to the direction of where the sun is starting to rise to catch a glimpse. Planetary warningA word of warning, however. Astrologers blamed the Black Death in the 14th century on a conjunction of the same three planets in 1345. No such portents of doom accompany the sight of the “golden handle” of the moon, which will be visible on Friday and Saturday nights. The “golden handle” is the name given to a view of the Jura mountains on the moon. It appears in relief in the top left-hand corner of the moon when it is partially full. Again, a pair of binoculars or a small telescope will show the mountains clearly. This will be followed by a supermoon on Wednesday. A supermoon occurs when the moon is at perigee, or closest to the Earth. This particular supermoon is called the pink supermoon as it corresponds with the spring flowering of the moss pink in North America. This supermoon is also the Paschal full moon, which is the name given to the full moon that appears before Easter Sunday. The moveable feast of Easter is held on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox in March.

Photograph: MaxwellsPA WireFianna Fáil and Fine Gael will have a majority in the Seanad if they form a coalition following the completion of the marathon five-day vocational panel election count.Fianna Fáil won 16 seats, up two, while Fine Gael has 12, down from 14 in the last Seanad. A Government requires a minimum of 31 for a majority in the 60-seat Upper House. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed he will use Fine Gael’s share of the 11 Seanad members appointed by the next taoiseach as an “accelerator” to get more women into the Oireachtas, if part of a new coalition, after the party failed to get any women elected to the Seanad.The party’s TDs, senators and councillors largely ignored his appeal to them in a letter to support women, and Fine Gael senators Maria Byrne, Gabrielle McFadden and controversial senator Catherine Noone lost their seats in the Seanad election.Mr Varadkar said on Friday the party favours “accelerators” other than quotas and that the next taoiseach should use their appointments to ensure there are more women in the OireachtasA spokesperson for Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said Seanad appointments “are a matter for discussion between the leaders if a programme for government is agreed. Fianna Fáil is delighted to have three strong female candidates elected in these Seanad elections.” In the new Seanad Sinn Féin has five Senators, including former MP for Derry Elisha McCallion and former MEP Lynn Boylan.The Labour Party has four new Senators and five seats, including Trinity College Senator Ivana Bacik, who was re-elected. All six outgoing NUI and Trinity College Senators were returned.The Green Party has two seats, while there are four Independents on the vocational panels. Independents Brian Ó Domhnaill and disabilities campaigner John Dolan lost their seats, but colourful Independent councillor Sharon Keogan is a newcomer to the House.Administrative panelIn the administrative panel Fianna Fáil secured three seats, including one for former Kildare TD Fiona O’Loughlin. Kerry Senator Mark Daly topped the poll for the panel and was elected on the first count, but outgoing party senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee lost her seat with a low first-preference vote, while Diarmuid Wilson retained his.Fine Gael’s Martin Conway retained his seat on the panel and party colleague and Tipperary councillor Garret Ahearn was also elected. However, former Fine Gael TD Noel Rock failed to get elected, trailing from the outset of the count.Dublin Labour councillor Rebecca Moynihan also made it to the Seanad, gaining a seat on the panel, while Belfast-based Sinn Féin Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile retained his seat. Twenty former TDs contested the Seanad election, of whom nine secured Seanad seats, including Fianna Fáil’s Lisa Chambers, Malcolm Byrne, Eugene Murphy, Pat Casey and Shane Cassells. High-profile former TD Timmy Dooley, who was at the centre of the “votegate” controversy, failed to win a seat. Fine Gael Ministers of State Michael D’Arcy and Seán Kyne will also return to the Oireachtas after having gained Seanad seats.Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty, who lost her seat in the general election, did not rule out staying on in Cabinet as a Seanad nominee.Asked about the issue on RTÉ she said she had “made my peace with losing my seat but regret it now more than ever”.However, some Fine Gael members said there would be a lot of concern among the party’s TDs that such a move would affect the positions of elected female Ministers in a coalition, given the party’s limited number of potential cabinet places."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4220051.1585954242!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"victory for alan kelly in labour leadership contest as aodh%C3%A1n %C3%B3 r%C3%ADord%C3%A1in concedes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA live video link has been made available to the campaign teams of Alan Kelly (right) and Aodhán Ó Ríordáin. File photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTipperary TD Alan Kelly is the new leader of the Labour Party after beating off competition from his party rival Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, who conceded on Friday night.Mr Kelly will become the 13th leader of the party. Close to 2,000 party members voted in the election following a campaign which lasted almost six weeks. According to the party, the total valid poll was 1,915, with one spoiled vote. Mr Kelly secured 1,047 and Mr Ó Ríordáin 868. Speaking after his defeat, Mr Ó Ríordáin congratulated Mr Kelly on his election as leader of the party.“I want to congratulate his family, who I know are very proud of him. I know that Labour’s values are safe in Alan’s hands. I want to thank Brendan Howlin for his leadership of the party over the last four years.” He said he enjoyed the campaign immensely and called on the party to unite. “We have a lot of work to help lead Ireland through our currently difficulties and through the recovery.”Mr Ó Ríordáin tweeted at 9.48pm: “I’ve just called @alankellylabour to congratulate him on his election as leader of the @labour party.“I can’t thank my campaign team \u0026amp my family enough for their support over the last few weeks.“Time now to unite and work together for our great party and our country.”Mr Kelly had secured 58 per cent of the vote when three quarters of the ballots were counted last night.The count was carried out by senior counsel Conor Power with a live link to the two campaign teams because of coronavirus restrictions.Former leader Brendan Howlin stepped down after the general election in February when his party won just six Dáil seats.When he announced his candidacy in February, Mr Kelly said he wanted to restore Labour to the “leadership of the left”. “This party was founded to advance the interests of workers,” he said. “Now it is time to go back to basics.” He said the party needs to move past apologising for policies implemented in the past and that “too many doors were closed to us, too many minds were closed to us” in recent years.Mr Kelly will now be tasked with deciding whether Labour should enter Government formation talks.The party’s position that it should go into opposition was reiterated at a private meeting of Labour TDs earlier this week.The six party TDs held a teleconference meeting during which they discussed the coronavirus crisis and government formation. Those on the call were current leader Brendan Howlin, leadership contenders Alan Kelly and Aodhán Ó Ríordáin as well as TDs Ged Nash, Seán Sherlock and Duncan Smith.One source said there was “no dissension” from the position that Labour should go into opposition while another said Mr Kelly expressed a view that was in line with the “thrust” of the general attitude of the meeting. But supporters of Mr Kelly are split on whether the party should enter government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in the weeks ahead.Duncan Smith, the recently elected Dublin Fingal TD who helped launch Mr Kelly’s leadership campaign, said he believes Labour should go into opposition. His view contradicts that of Cork East TD Seán Sherlock, another supporter of Mr Kelly, who said Labour should consider entering government.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4220342.1585939332!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"starmer poised to step centre stage as uk labour party leader","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer: “Having lost not just one election, but having lost four, and having lost the last one badly, the rebuild through to probably 2024 is huge.” Photograph: Darren StaplesReutersAt 10.45am on Saturday, after a three-month campaign that passed mostly under the radar of the British public, the next leader of the Labour Party will be named. The announcement will come in the form of a press release with a link to a pre-recorded video message by the successful candidates for leader and deputy leader.Opinion polls, anecdotal evidence and the private predictions of all the campaigns point to clear victories for shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer as leader and shadow education secretary Angela Rayner as deputy leader. The fact that the result has been seen as a foregone conclusion for so long has helped to drain much of the drama out of the contest and the coronavirus has pushed it to the margins of the news agenda.The coronavirus crisis has, however, made the election more consequential than before and Conservative MPs admit privately that a Starmer-led Labour Party now has a real chance of driving the government from office in 2024. There is talk in Whitehall of inviting Starmer to take part in some of the Cobra emergency group meetings about the epidemic and even some speculation about a national unity government.A former barrister who served as director of public prosecutions (DPP) from 2008 to 2013, Starmer has been careful to avoid directly criticising the government’s handling of the crisis. But he is likely to play an important role over the coming months in holding the government to account for its handling of the epidemic.The government’s economic policy response to the crisis, which has seen a state intervention in the economy unprecedented in peacetime, will make it difficult for Boris Johnson to portray Starmer’s Labour as a party of statist spendthrifts. And while a new opposition leader would normally lament the lack of media attention due to the coronavirus, Starmer might benefit from staying out of the spotlight at the start of his leadership.PurgeHis first action is expected to be a purge of many of Jeremy Corbyn’s allies from the shadow cabinet and from the party bureaucracy. Starmer’s clear-out will not be motivated by ideology – he comes from Labour’s soft left and is comfortable with most of Corbyn’s policies – but out of a determination to stamp out factionalism.His margin of victory over shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Corbynite candidate, and backbencher Lisa Nandy could determine how much leeway Starmer enjoys in reshaping the party’s hierarchy.“I have tried to run a disciplined, positive and professional campaign, and I’m going to carry on doing that,” he told the New Statesman this week.\u0026nbsp“What comes after that is for whoever emerges as leader of the Labour Party, but I am well aware of the scale of the task. Having lost not just one election, but having lost four, and having lost the last one badly, the rebuild through to probably 2024 is huge. That will require change.”Although some former Labour MPs who lost their seats last December blame Starmer for pushing the party towards advocating a second Brexit referendum, he accepts that the battle over leaving the European Union is now over. The coronavirus has the potential to change the debate about Britain’s future relationship with the EU, as the negotiating timetable is likely to slip.Starmer is unlikely to call on Johnson to request an extension to the transition period beyond the end of this year but the prime minister could be left with no option but to extend it. As the bitterness of the Brexit debate is replaced by a sober assessment of the economic consequences of the coronavirus, Britain could become receptive to the case for maintaining a close economic relationship with the EU and Starmer will be ideally placed to make it.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus: Nearly 1,500 Americans killed in 24 hours, the worst single-day death surge in the worldHow does a coronavirus antibody home test kit work, and how do I get one?What essential shops are open during the coronavirus lockdown?What time can I do my food shop - and what are the rationing rules?How many coronavirus cases are in your area?

China was affected weeks before any other nation, but has only reported around 82,500 cases so far.By comparison, the US which had its first coronavirus case in mid-January, has reported more than 245,000 – more than three times China’s figure, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University in America. The UK, whose population is less than five per cent of China’s – and which has lagged far behind on testing - has already reported 34,173 cases. This is 41 per cent of China’s total.Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith, an outspoken China critic, told the : There has already been a hit on the Chinese economy as a result of this, so their desperate concern is to alleviate that as quickly as possible - and my concern is that in that drive to do so, the figures for what is happening in China are being obscured.”He added: “I really don’t believe these figures. I think they’ve suppressed it massively.”A WHO spokesman said: “WHO’s mandate is to keep all people safe everywhere and this is what our scientists and public health experts are doing. The membership of the UN is decided by the countries. This does not affect WHO’s mandate as an evidence-based organization that safeguards the global public health.”Allies of Dr Tedros point to the fact that, as the former health minister then foreign minister of Ethiopia, he is naturally given to diplomacy – and that praising China ensures the nation continues sharing critical information.However, critics note that China was highly influential in him gaining the position in the first place.According to reports, Chinese diplomats campaigned hard for him in the 2017 leadership election, using the promise of Beijing’s financial muscle to put pressure on developing countries to do the same – helping him to stave off competition from Britain’s David Nabarro.The official toll of the number of cases is not the only point of information that has shaped the way other countries prepared for coronavirus. Chinese authorities also peddled the line that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission - apparently overlooking early signs that patients were catching it from each other.A paper published in The Lancet and co-authored by doctors who worked at Jin Yin-tan hospital in Wuhan noted that the wife of the very first patient to die of coronavirus also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in the isolation ward”.The study - Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China - stops short of saying she caught coronavirus from him, but points out that she had “no known history of exposure to the market”.The same study also claims that just one of the four earliest known coronavirus patients had links to Huanan Seafood Market - casting doubt on the popular notion advanced in Wuhan that the disease originated in wet markets.There, a shrimp seller named Wei Guixian, was identified by the Wall Street Journal as one of the very first patients, after she began experiencing symptoms on December 10.However, experts now believe that the disease began to spread in China much earlier than that. A little-discussed graph in the Lancet paper claims that the first coronavirus patient started feeling the effects of the disease on 1 December – a week and a half earlier.Meanwhile, the South China Morning Post claims to have seen confidential government documents that suggest the first confirmed coronavirus patient may have contracted the disease on 17 November. If true, knowing about it early on would have had huge ramifications.Research by the University of Southampton suggests that 95 per cent of infections could have been avoided if China had acted three weeks earlier.Professor Larry Gostin, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on Public Health Law \u0026amp Human Rights, told the : It delayed for three to four weeks before reporting a novel virus to the WHO which probably cost hundreds of thousands of lives globally…Its record does not deserve praise.The first whistle-blower was Ai Fen, a senior doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who on 30 December posted information about the new virus on the WeChat social media platform.Later that day, Dr Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at the same hospital, also posted information on WeChat about the virus he believed to be Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or Sars.He and Dr Ai were both reprimanded, and Dr Wenliang was instructed by the hospital to write a “reflection” on the spread of false information.Within two days, the Wuhan Public Security Bureau had reportedly called another eight doctors in for questioning after they discussed the virus on social media. According to Chinese media, the Hubei Provincial Health Commission ordered laboratories that were testing samples for the new virus to stop doing so, and to destroy any existing samples they had.John Mackenzie, a member of the World Health Organisation’s emergency committee and emeritus professor at Curtin University in Australia, told the Financial Times in February that some aspects of China’s response was “reprehensible” and that he believes they tried to “keep the figures quiet for a while”.Mr Mackenzie’s misgivings were backed by numerous reports in Chinese media, but Dr Tedros distanced himself from Mr Mackenzie’s critical remarks.He said that he could not comment whether or not China had hidden the start of the coronavirus outbreak but that if China did conceal the extent of the outbreak “it really defeats logic” because there would have been a higher number of cases around the world.That was in February, when the number of non-Chinese cases was still “very small”. The global death toll is now around 54,000.The WHO position is in contrast to the organisation’s handling of the 2003 SARS crisis when Gro Harlem Brundtland was director general.When the WHO declared a global health alert for SARS, there were just over 150 cases worldwide. When Covid-19 was named a public health emergency of international concern, there were nearly 10,000.Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, and author of a paper on the SARS response, said that the WHO did not use the new range of tools that have since been put at its disposal.This is rejected by the WHO, which says that it co-ordinates the international response to Covid-19 in a “transparent way”, publishing on its website information that can help countries and iniduals respond to the crisis.“Part of WHO’s mandate is to inform all member states and we do it both through bilateral exchanges and through weekly briefings where all countries are invited. Throughout the outbreak, there have been regular and frequent meetings and discussions between WHO leadership and technical experts from around the world,” a spokesman said. Indeed, Dr Nabarro – who fought Dr Tedros to become director general and is now a WHO envoy – suggested that his former opponent may have got the balance right. “When this started, we were able to benefit from china making the structure of the virus available in the public domain extremely quickly and we’re grateful for that and we’re grateful for information that has been received about the virus.”“Let’s do all the post mortems of all governments when we’ve got through this. We will all be accountable and that’s how it should be.” Professor Gostin, who was Dr Nabarro’s spokesman during the leadership race, was less charitable. “When we look back and see so much praise going towards China and its system will the message be that civil rights aren\u0027t as important as we believe them to be?

They pull together and strive for common goals, albeit with a bit of fraying at the edges.For decades, behavioural scientists have studied how iniduals make sacrifices for common goals. Two crucial success factors are the desirability of the goal and whether everyone can see clearly how their behaviour leads to it. Thus far, the first factor has been straightforward. Random and potentially lethal infection is frightening and reducing it highly desirable. The second factor, meanwhile, has been ensured by a massive global public health campaign. So what do these two insights tell us about what happens next?While sensitivity to fear may decline somewhat, it will remain pretty strong. It is the second factor, the clear link from behaviour to collective goal, that is troublesome. For at some point, the epidemiologists will advise that restrictions can be partially lifted. Some workplaces will re-open, some gatherings will be allowed. It may be a crucial moment. As the crisis deepened, the logic that tighter restrictions on social activity would slow infection was easy to follow and daily increases in infections and deaths provided clear feedback. But can we reach similar collective understanding of how it is fine to relax some restrictions yet vital to keep others? Once infection is declining, what is the common goal?Epidemiologists, behavioural scientists and politicians will need to work together to articulate why some behaviours are fine but others not, and how this is best for all. Feedback on progress towards a collective goal is vital. One possibility is to relax restrictions in small steps, making each conditional on infections continuing to fall.Extraordinary global solidarity has characterised our initial response to this crisis. Getting out of it will require more subtle, but equally strong, collective action. Eric Brunner, professor of social and biological epidemiology, at UCLLockdown exit (\u0027Lexit\u0027) will not be a single event. Our collective yearning for an end-date will only grow, but as the terrible Covid-19 misery grinds on we must, as Goya warned, not let reason sleep. We will learn by observing epidemic trajectories in other countries as their policies change, but we will need to monitor carefully what happens in the UK before and after cautious relaxation of social distancing rules, when the decision is made.Testing will inform our responses. We must be prepared for anything, from a waning epidemic to a return to full lockdown. Meaningful Lexit must wait for a vaccine, and everyone must have it, unless clearly contraindicated. Vaccine hesitancy is a luxury we can no longer afford. Between now and then, testing for active disease and antibody-based immunity is clearly a priority. A fundamental principle in epidemiology, the scientific foundation of public health policy, is accurate measurement of health status.  Without measuring the rate of Covid-19 infection, reliably, in the population, over the coming weeks and months, evidence-based policy development will be impossible. The epidemic has been poorly monitored up to now and this scandal must stop. We need a programme of rolling, representative surveys to capture the pattern of spread of Covid-19 in the UK, and how it changes. Age, sex, socioeconomic position, ethnicity and national region are vitally important variables. They are all underlying determinants of severe disease and death, and the evolution of the epidemic.The proportion of asymptomatic Sars-CoV-2 - the virus that causes Covid-19 - carriers in the population and the duration of immunity after infection are two major known unknowns at present. Both are critical for prospects of Lexit. Social solidarity, thankfully, is being expressed in myriad ways during the lockdown. Participating in Covid-19 surveys and research is a vital contribution to the social good.It is right to balance the benefits of saving lives which might be lost to Covid-19 against the costs of shutting down large parts of the economy. But this trade-off is still firmly in favour of maintaining the emergency measures for as long as the health experts think is necessary to get on top of the virus. Even a very large fall in GDP, lasting many months, would be a fair price to pay.There are also three reasons for optimism. First, this approach is supported by the lessons from history. For example, studies of how different US cities responded to the ‘Spanish Flu’ pandemic in 1918 found that those who intervened earlier and more aggressively recovered more quickly.Second, there are encouraging precedents elsewhere today. China has started to lift some of its restrictions and the economy there is now gradually returning to normal, albeit slowly. Admittedly, much of China’s data is suspect. But similar improvements are being seen in other Asian economies which are also further down the road than the UK, notably South Korea and Taiwan (thanks to relatively effective testing and contact tracing).The third factor is the basic economics. Activity has fallen sharply because the UK government itself has slammed on the brakes. The exit strategy is therefore simple: gradually remove the restrictions as evidence grows that each has achieved its objectives.In the meantime, economic policy is doing the right things: protect businesses, jobs and incomes, so that the economy can quickly reboot. But the government should not hesitate to spend more if needed. With interest rates so low, and lower than future inflation, the real cost of borrowing is actually negative. The burden of debt will therefore be shared with the holders of UK government bonds, who don’t seem to mind at all.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cartel suns venezuelas maduro generals allegedly built huge","story":"It reads like a plot from the Netflix drama Narcos - if a little far-fetched.Desperate to bankroll his flagging regime, a Latin American ruler and his generals form one of the biggest drug cartels the world has ever seen. Working with Colombian paramilitaries, they flood America with hundreds of tonnes of cocaine every year.This is not some overdone script line, but an indictment read out last week when Oliver Alcalá, a Venezuelan general, appeared in a New York court. He is alleged to be a key player in the Cartel of the Suns, a cabal of drug-running generals answering to none other than President Nicolas Maduro himself.According to prosecutors, the cartel ran a huge narco-terrorism empire with FARC rebels in neighbouring Colombia, selling them weapons in exchange for drugs.Mr Maduro, who is named in the indictment as the cartel\u0027s ultimate leader, has denounced the claims as yet another US smear. But it will now be his word against that of Mr Alcala - who turned himself in to the US authorities last weekend, and is expected to give evidence against his former boss.An acolyte of Mr Maduro\u0027s late predecessor, Hugo Chavez, Mr Alcala fell out with Mr Maduro in 2016 over his handling of Venezuela’s socialist economy, which is now suffering hyper-inflation.He fled to Colombia two years later, becoming a vocal critic of the regime and pledging support for Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader recognised by Washington as Venezuela\u0027s legitimate leader.Last weekend, Mr Alcala surrendered himself to DEA agents in the Colombian port city of Barranquilla, who then flew him to the US, where he is now in custody in a secret location.He bade farewell to his family in a video posted on Twitter, declaring: “I face the responsibilities for my actions with the truth.The day before he handed himself in, US officials had issued a $10m reward for his capture, along with a $15m bounty on Mr Maduro, who was charged along with 14 other government figures.For Washington to bring criminal charges against a serving head of state is almost unheard of.US officials said the bounty - three times the $5m offered for Mexican drug lord Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán - reflects the extraordinary scale of the plot.“For more than 20 years, Maduro and a number of high-ranking colleagues allegedly conspired with the FARC, causing tons of cocaine to enter and devastate American communities,” said Bill Barr, the US Attorney General.The indictments claim that Mr Maduro received $5m in FARC drug proceeds while working as foreign minister and continued to facilitate large-scale drug trafficking” after becoming president in 2013. An estimated 250 tonnes were exported to America annually.Although Mr Alcala has pleaded not guilty, he tweeted last week that he had been co-operating with US officials for some time. He is thought to be hoping for clemency in return for revealing the cartel’s inner workings.The Cartel of the Suns dates back to the early 1990s, when generals in Venezuela\u0027s National Guard took bribes to turn a blind eye to traffickers smuggling cocaine from Colombia to Venezuela\u0027s Caribbean coast.Its name comes from the sun-shaped stars worn by some Venezuelan generals on their lapels. The cartel then expanded into trafficking itself, allegedly helping to finance Mr Chavez\u0027s rise to power. In 2005, he shut down Washington\u0027s DEA bureau in Venezuela, claiming it was a front for US espionage.  Mr Alcala\u0027s alleged role in the cartel first emerged in 2011, when the US named him as one of four narcotics kingpins in the Venezuelan government. It claimed  he had used his command of a Venezuelan armoured ision to run an arms-for-drugs route with the FARC.  Jeremy McDermott, director of Insight Crime, an investigative website covering Latin American mafias, said the cartel probably trafficked nearer to 400 tonnes a year, with a significant proportion likely to have headed to Britain and Europe.Venezuela is one of the only countries where drug trafficking is done by government rather than non-state actors, he told The .It started under Chavez, although I don\u0027t think he actively encouraged it. But under Maduro, the criminal economy has become far more important.Other defendants named in the latest US indictment include Tareck Aissami, the former vice-president, and Maikel Moreno, the supreme court chief justice.As Venezuela has no extradition treaty with America, none are likely to face trial in the US. But the prospect of a former regime insider giving evidence could be deeply embarrassing, and used as yet another lever against the regime.Mr Maduro rejected the depiction him of as a modern-day Pablo Escobar, describing it as a fantasy of the racist cowboy Donald Trump.However, two of his wife Flores\u0027s nephews are already serving 18 years in a US prison after being caught in a DEA sting trying to smuggle in $20m of cocaine into America. The pair boasted to an undercover agent that they could bring the drugs in through Mr Maduro\u0027s private airport hangar in Caracas. Prosecutors said the plot was to raise political funds for Mr Maduro.Mr Alcala also tweeted last week that he was providing weapons to Mr Guaido to help him overthrow Mr Maduro, although US officials are sceptical of his claims.The timing of the charges against Mr Maduro seem designed to increase pressure on him to step down, an outcome Washington has sought ever since accusing him of rigging the 2018 election. On Tuesday, Washington offered to ease economic sanctions if Mr Maduro agreed to step aside in favour of a transitional council.  And on Thursday, US Southern Command sent additional warships to combat drug trafficking in the Caribbean, in a show of force to Caracas.I think the US sees this as a perfect storm for Venezuela, said Mr McDermott. They are using the drug charges as another big stick and then saying to Mr Maduro: \u0027look, there is a way out.Mr Alcala may now help that happen, possibly at some personal risk. For if he does incriminate his old comrades, he may be mindful of the fate met by all too many informers in Narcos.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus swedish experiment could prove britain wrong","story":"In Sweden, an interesting experiment is playing out, which may soon reveal that Britain is way off when it comes to modelling the number of coronavirus patients who will end up in intensive care.The country has bucked the near-global lockdown trend, choosing to allow schools, businesses and sports venues to remain open and relying on the good sense of its citizens to control the virus through social distancing and maintaining good hygiene.But the country has chosen this path largely because its prediction of how its health service will cope is vastly different from the trajectory that British modellers have forecast.The vast ramping up of intensive care beds in the UK in recent weeks was driven by modelling from Imperial College, which suggested up to 30 per cent of people who are hospitalised for coronavirus will need intensive care.Amid fears that the NHS would not be able to cope, Britain was placed in lockdown to give the health service time to reach capacity.In contrast, the Swedes believe patients needing intensive care will be somewhere closer to five per cent of those hospitalised and so have been cautious about extending their ICU capacity.Unlike Britain, Sweden is far more transparent about releasing data, so information on whether it has made the right calculation will soon be available.So far in Britain around nine per cent of patients testing positive for coronavirus in hospital have died, suggesting that at least that proportion of patients needed intensive care treatment.Many more will have recovered after being in ITU, so the figure could well turn out to be higher than Sweden is predicting, placing it in an unprepared position.The country has recently started building a military field hospital near Stockholm with 600 extra beds, but it will have just 10 intensive care beds to start with, an indicator that the government is not expecting a surge of very sick patients.The country believes it will see the biggest need for intensive care beds at the end of May, estimating that 500 to 1,000 patients will require intensive care.Yet despite having the lowest number of hospital beds per thousand in Europe, it is confident it will cope.The state epidemiologist who is staking his reputation on the strategy is Anders Tegnell (below), who has been scathing of the initial Imperial modelling that set Britain on the path to lockdown.It might be right, but it might also be terribly wrong, he said. In Sweden, we are a bit surprised that it\u0027s had such an impact.The former state epidemiologist, Prof Emeritus Johan Giesecke, is in agreement with Mr Tegnell, stating recently in an article for the daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet: The lack of reliable knowledge explains why countries choose to do things differently: nobody knows what really works, and they choose measures either on the basis of shaky data or for political reasons. All models require that you enter numeric values for different parameters - values that we often miss and must estimate or guess.   Crucially, Mr Tegnell is releasing all the data on a daily basis so that it will soon become apparent how well Sweden is doing compared to elsewhere and give a stark indication of whether Imperial modelling is mirrored in real-world data.Sweden is believed to be a couple of weeks behind Britain, having recorded around 6,000 cases and 333 deaths - 10 times fewer that the UK - but experts there are not expecting a big peak, or much more demand than usual.Although the country has not explicitly said it is attempting to build herd immunity, it wants to slow the virus to a manageable pace.Mr Tegnell has said it is inevitable the disease will sweep through a large proportion of the population, and allowing it to do so could prevent a surge in demand, which could cripple their health services.The strategy is not without its critics, and some 2,000 scientists and researchers have signed an open letter criticising Sweden\u0027s Public Health Agency.Sten Linnarsson, Professor in Molecular Systemic Biology at the world-renowned Karolinska Institute, has branded the plan embarrassing, while others have called it a cynical ploy to reach herd immunity at the cost of thousands of lives.But public health officials have one more trick up their sleeves to dampen down the fears over the virus. The country is also about to start releasing figures that show how many people died from coronavirus rather than died with coronavirus, as the British statistics show.Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, has told the UK Government\u0027s Science Technology and Health Committee that up to two thirds of deaths of people with coronavirus would probably have happened this year anyway.So it will be interesting to find out just how many can actually be attributed to the virus, a figure that Britain is unlikely to find out before annual mortality figures are released early next year.The Swedes believe that changing how the figures are reported will cut the number of people dying from coronavirus by as much as four fifths, and slash the death rate to well below 1 per cent, perhaps even lower than seasonal flu.The transparency of the data coming out of Sweden is also giving a better indication of how the virus is playing out in a European population, rather than relying on modelling and estimates coming out of China.So far it appears that men account for the vast majority of intensive care cases, with women making up just 24 per cent of those infected.Likewise, of those needing intensive care, some 76 per cent had underlying health conditions, with high blood pressure being the biggest risk factor.In Britain, it could end up being even higher. Just 6 per cent of people who died on Friday, 3 April had no reported health problems.Whatever happens, within weeks it will become apparent whether Sweden\u0027s gamble has been a triumph of common sense or a catastrophic and deadly mistake.And the results of the experiment will be felt throughout the world. If public health officials do manage to flatten the curve it will make it far more difficult for the UK to continue imposing a lockdown that is devastating the economy.Likewise, if deaths surge, it will give governments the ammunition they need to keep restrictions in place for longer, perhaps even until a vaccine or treatment is available. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2020/03/30/TELEMMGLPICT000228776336_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqdsBoNc5Q1tcKBq1Fh6n_BoCO6ynE_MBL155WMllozCw.jpeg?im","title":"publics patience jobsworth overreach lockdown could soon wear","story":"The withering assumption that we are so stupid that we need micromanaging  takes us into worrying territory.There are advantages to living in a cul-de-sac. Sure, we dead-end dwellers  are rich material for suburbia-bashing. But during lockdown it\u0027s the gift that keeps on giving. The other evening, billeted at our front gates, three of us idled away the time screaming updates about our inidual incarceration. And, oh, the sweetness of such human contactBut is it foolish to admit to this? After all, who knows if we might get slapped with a fine for unnecessary communal chit-chat at a time of raging pandemic?Not least amidst rumours that next week will herald even tighter restrictions as we trip unhappily into what is clearly becoming lockdown overreach.We\u0027ve seen signs of it already. From sanctioning parents when their frustrated teens – caged and purposeless like  bluebottles under a glass – stray outside, to reports that tech companies are in talks with the government about handing over location data to track social distancing.And - for me a particular low point - news from the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS) that “heavy-handed” officials, including police and local councils, had been “misreading” the rules in cracking down on convenience stores selling Easter Eggs (calling them non-essential items was a particular low point).Is it any wonder that some forces are even reporting a surge in 999 calls  as curtain-twitchers snitch on neighbours who take more than one form of outdoor exercise a day.Of course we need to be  prudent– we\u0027re in this together and naked disregard for the sensible stuff such as hand-washing and social distancing is only going to prolong our internment. What\u0027s more, there needs to be respect for the rule of law, and recognition of the noble and difficult work our police have to do, as well as the challenges which our forces face – now more than ever.But the withering assumption that, we, the public, are so stupid that we need micromanaging  takes us into worrying territory.As  former supreme court justice Lord Sumption said earlier this week, enforcement of lockdown measures is in danger of turning Britain into a “police state”.And, for my money, they\u0027re a dreadful waste of police resources too.Like many, I admit it\u0027s taken time for me to bleakly accept that  curtailment of our freedoms is going to go on for far longer than I originally – stupidly – thought. News that the Edinburgh Festival has been cancelled even though it doesn\u0027t take place until August – August! -   was a particular blow  since it seems such a long time away.What it tells us, though, is that battling coronavirus is a marathon not a sprint.  And if we\u0027re going sustain ourselves during these dark days , then we need law enforcers to show common sense. Not knee jerk tactics or zealous, jobs-worthian application of the rules.Much of the problem stems from the huge disconnect between what legislation restricting movements forbids us to do and what the Government advises us to do. A situation which doubtless stems from the fact restrictions came into force as a statutory instrument -  rushed into law with no discussion or debate.Sure there are some people whose foolish and thoughtless behaviour has to be challenged – from panic-buying loo rolls to the karaoke parties and beach-side barbecues for 20 close friendsBut for the majority, the last thing we need during these stifling, uncertain, economically crippling, mentally exhausting times is a lockdown overreach.The Police and the Government need to trust us to understand the spirit of the  law. Not punish us for failing to observe its every letter.

Therefore, against all Government advice, I broke my curfew and at 6.30 in the morning, in temperatures of minus two degrees, I queued outside our local Waitrose until they opened at 7am. I was then able to do a shop which should last me for the next couple of weeks, at which time I will again have to come out of isolation again unless I can get a slot. I am only too well aware of the difficult times in which we now live, but I am also aware that Government has instructed the elderly to stay at home, so perhaps supermarkets should be more considerate and helpful to the many people who, like me, should not go shopping.Another Waitrose customer explained that she had also had to visit the supermarket in person after being told the next available slot for a delivery was in June.Chris Cooper, 71, from Fleet, Hampshire said: Having self-isolated at home for almost two weeks, I was delighted when I received an email from Waitrose to say I had been identified as a vulnerable customer and would therefore be eligible for a priority slot.I went online immediately to book one, but was told the next available delivery was not until the end of June, by which point I would have starved. I am fortunate enough to be in a position to be able to go out and collect my shopping, despite the risk, but there are many others who will not have that option. I dread to think what will happen to them.Waitrose has increased the number of slots available but has admitted the current demand for online deliveries has been far outstripping capacity.Sainsbury\u0027s customers have reported similar issues, even though the supermarket last week wrote to 270,000 people it had identified as vulnerable to tell them they would have priority for future delivery services.Garth McGowan, 75, from Cambridgeshire, has been warned that he is a high-risk person because he suffers from the lung condition called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. But despite having shopped at Sainsbury\u0027s for many years and having an online account, it is in his wife\u0027s name. She is not in the vulnerable category, and therefore not entitled to one of the priority slots.A Sainsbury\u0027s spokesman said: We\u0027re working with Government to prioritise the nation\u0027s most vulnerable customers for online delivery slots. We are also prioritising as many orders from elderly and vulnerable customers as possible and experiencing extremely high demand for this service.  We have significantly expanded our capacity and are doing our very best to offer home delivery to everyone who needs it. We are giving thousands of additional slots to customers over the phone every day, and urge anyone who believes they are eligible to keep trying.A spokesman for Waitrose admitted that demand was still outstripping capacity but added: We\u0027ve been working to increase capacity for Waitrose – by next week we\u0027ll be running at 50 percent more slots than usual.The spokesman added that the firm had taken on hundreds of extra drivers to try and meet the increased demand, and said: Currently, 50 percent of our slots are booked by elderly or vulnerable customers and we have been contacting such customers to offer them one. It\u0027s important to note, though, that we knew when we started this we won\u0027t have enough capacity for all those who wanted a slot – there is such high demand. We\u0027re looking at what else we can do to reach customers who need us, including how we can reach those on the Government\u0027s vulnerable list, which we\u0027ve now received.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk says no need wear masks public defying calls rethink","story":"The UK Government has reiterated that people do not need to wear face masks in public, refusing to change their guidance despite both the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the White House considering the move. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, said that while the practice was “wired into” some Southeast Asian countries there was no evidence it helped stop the spread of Covid-19. “There is no evidence that general wearing of face masks by the public who are well affects the spread of the disease in our society. What matters is social distancing,” Prof Van-Tam said at a Downing Street press conference on Friday. He added: In terms of the hard evidence and what the UK Government recommends, we do not recommend face masks for general wearing by the public.The remarks come despite mounting pressure for a rethink as new medical research suggests it can make an impact and countries increasingly tell their citizens to cover their mouth and nose when leaving the house. A new study published in the journal Nature Medicine found that when people with coronavirus or similar viruses breathed out through a mask it reduced the amount of infected droplets escaping into the air. Meanwhile surging demand for masks has left countries across the world scrambling for supplies, at times leading to heated clashes that undercut recent pledges from leaders for unity in the fight against coronavirus.Regional politicians in both France and Germany have accused the US government of intervening at the last moment to redirect masks due to come to their countries from China to go to America instead. Jean Rottner, head of France’s Grand Est region, claimed masks headed for France were redirected “on the runway after Americans offered \u0027three or four times the price in cash”. He said: “We’re fighting 24 hours a day.” Andreas Geisel, a Berlin city official, said 200,000 highly sought-after FFP2 masks, made by an US firm in China and destined for use by Berlin police, were confiscated in Bangkok. He added: “We see this as an act of modern-day piracy.” Much of the focus is on securing masks from China, where concerns about fraud have emerged. One man in Shaoxing city was sentenced to 10 years for trying to sell a cargo of masks that was actually just filled with tree branches.Throughout the outbreak Asian countries like China and South Korea have encouraged the use of masks, but the practice is now being adopted by governments in Europe, with Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bosnia-Herzegovina all ordering their use in public. Austria announced this week that masks must be used in supermarkets, with the country’s chancellor Sebastian Kurz saying: “I am fully aware that masks are alien to our culture. This will require a big adjustment.German and French governments are also under pressure to do similar. The German city of Jena has ordered their use in shops and on public transport, while a spokesman for the country’s health ministry said a nationwide move could be considered. The WHO currently advises that those with Covid-19 or symptoms should wear masks if outside but only healthy people caring for others already infected also need to do so. But with evidence emerging that scores of people with coronavirus show few symptoms and that just breathing could spread the virus the WHO is reconsidering it guidance.Prof David Heymann, who chairs a panel of advisers to the WHO, said the body was looking at the new evidence to see whether or not there should be a change in the way it\u0027s recommending masks should be used”. He told the BBC that if evidence suggesting droplets could be projected further than thought from coughs and sneezes is correct then “it might be that wearing a mask is equally as effective or more effective than distancing”.Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO\u0027s top emergencies expert, said on Friday that there may be situations where wearing a mask may reduce the rate of infection. We must preserve medical surgical respirator masks for our frontline workers, but the idea of using respiratory coverings or mouth coverings to prevent coughing or sneezing... that in itself is not a bad idea, he said. In America, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US government’s leading health institute, is set to issue new guidance suggesting many Americans cover their nose and mouth when leaving. Donald Trump said on Thursday that new guidance was coming but that the rules would not be “mandatory”. It would be a major reversal, given the the Trump administration has been urging people for weeks not to buy masks. The US president has this week suggested that a scarf could prove more effective than a mask for people wishing not to pass on the virus when they leave home, saying: “In many ways, a scarf is better.

First, it failed to prepare the world for a pandemic, spending the years since the Sars and ebola alarms talking more about climate change, obesity and tobacco, while others, including the Wellcome Trust and the Gates foundation, actually set up a coalition for epidemic preparedness innovation, and countries like Singapore and South Korea put in place measures to cope with an outbreak like SARS in the future.Second, once the epidemic began in China, WHO downplayed its significance, tweeting as late as January 14 that “preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus”, when it had already been warned by the Taiwanese health authorities among others of strong evidence for medical staff in Wuhan becoming ill.The Chinese government at this stage had known for weeks that the virus was spreading, probably person to person, yet WHO then sycophantically praised the Chinese government. “China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response,” said WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a former foreign minister of Ethiopia, a country run by a repressive regime heavily dependent on China. “China is really good at keeping people alive,” echoed the assistant director-general, Bruce Aylward, on 3 March.On 29 March, a Hong Kong-based journalist asked Aylward to comment on Taiwan’s highly-successful efforts to defeat the virus. At first Aylward ignored the question, claiming not to have heard it. When the journalist offered to repeat it, strangely he said no, he would rather move on to another question. When she pressed, the call was mysteriously cut off. When the journalist called back and asked the question again, he answered a different question, talking about China, rather than Taiwan. The background here is that China is a big funder of WHO and insists that Taiwan be excluded from the organisation since it does not recognise Taiwan’s existence as a separate country. Taiwan banned travel from China very early in the pandemic.The third charge against WHO is that it has failed before. When the ebola outbreak in West Africa that was to kill 11,000 people began in late 2013, on its own admission WHO hindered the fight against the virus, obsessed with not letting others find out what was happening. In April 2014, the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres announced that the outbreak was out of control. They were promptly slapped down by a WHO spokesman. Others tried again in June to alert WHO. It was not until August that WHO admitted the gravity of the situation.Later WHO admitted its “initial response was slow and insufficient, we were not aggressive in alerting the world, our surge capacity was limited, we did not work effectively in coordination with other partners, there were shortcomings in risk communication.” All of which is true again today.WHO gives the impression it would rather reprimand rich countries for climate change or bad eating habits than worry about epidemics. It’s also a bit obsessed with celebrities. In 2018, Tedros and the singer Lady Gaga jointly wrote an article in the  about suicide. On 28 March this year, Tedros found time to tweet about having had “a very good call with @ladygaga.” He added: “And happy birthday @ladygaga! I am so touched that you’re spending this moment on finding ways to support the world during #COVID19. I send you my best wishes! Thank you for spreading kindness at such an important moment for all of us! Together!”It is an open secret among international diplomats and public health experts that WHO is “not fit for mission” (as one of them put it to me), riddled with politics and bureaucracy. Given its previous failures and the warning that was Sars, its leadership has no excuse for reacting so oddly, and so tardily, to the current crisis.Coronavirus: Nearly 1,500 Americans killed in 24 hours, the worst single-day death surge in the worldHow does a coronavirus antibody home test kit work, and how do I get one?What essential shops are open during the coronavirus lockdown?What time can I do my food shop - and what are the rationing rules?How many coronavirus cases are in your area?

All but two of the new cases involved travellers from overseas.Total number of infections in the mainland, which excludes asymptomatic patients, now stands at 81,620, while the death toll rose by four to 3,322. Worldwide, the number of cases has topped 1 million, with at least 52,000 deaths.Beijing has pushed the country\u0027s industries to go back to work as the epidemic eases, hoping for a quick recovery from what many analysts expect to have been a deep contraction for China\u0027s economy in the first quarter.Top officials however remain concerned about the risk of a second wave of infections.Wuhan Communist Party chief Wang Zhonglin said the threat of a rebound in the central city\u0027s coronavirus epidemic remained high and ordered residents to avoid leaving their homes unless it was necessary to do so.The comments came about two weeks after officials eased the total lockdown of Wuhan and allowed some its 11 million inhabitants to go outside for the first time since Jan. 23, though they were still not able to leave the city.The capital of central Hubei province has been the hardest hit by the virus, with 50,007 cases reported.The city is scheduled to allow people to travel outside the city on April 8, and volunteers in hazmat suits have been spraying public areas with disinfectant in preparation for an increase in activity.Restrictions have been gradually reimposed in other parts of China as well, including closures of cinemas that had been permitted to reopen.A county in the central province of Henan on Wednesday banned people from leaving without proper authorisation and prevented residents from leaving their homes for work without clearance following several coronavirus infections in the area.Top officials are also ordering local health authorities to step up detection, monitoring and supervision of the infected patients who do not show symptoms.Wuhan alone reported 51 new asymptomatic cases and said 705 people who had the virus but showed no symptoms remained under medical observation.Beijing has also indefinitely banned foreigners from entering the country to curb cases involving travellers from overseas, though it has chartered planes to repatriate Chinese nationals in countries with severe outbreaks.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/03/12/bruce-springsteen.jpg","title":"bruce springsteen radio station e street siriusxm listen free tom hanks","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Quarantine life just got easier for Bruce fansA radio station playing nothing but Bruce Springsteen\u0026nbspmusic has become available for free in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown.Sirius XM Radio announced that the channel, named\u0026nbspE Street Radio, was going free until 15 May.The station plays songs written by Springsteen, including covers, as well as live versions and rare tracks all day, every day.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn Europe, it can only be listened to for free on a laptop or computer – find the radio station here.It was originally launched in 2005 for three months, but was revived the following year and has remained available to stream ever since.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastSpringsteen himself phoned in to talk about the New Jersey\u0026nbspPandemic Relief Fund, which has been set as coronavirus continues to spread globally.He also updated listeners on the health of his friends Tom Hanks and Jackson Browne, who both tested positive for the illness last month.Yesterday (2 April), Hanks paid tribute to Adam Schlesinger, the Fountains of Wayne musician who wrote the title\u0026nbsptrack of his\u0026nbspfilm That Thing You Do!

Our data shows that film piracy visits increased by 89 per cent from 18 January to 26 January, the day after Chinese New Year and when the news of the pandemic was starting to spread globally,\u0026nbspMuso\u0026nbspwrote in a blog post.Muso\u0026nbsptracked 11.2 billion visits globally to piracy sites in February 2020, but with so many cinemas now closed globally and demand for content high, if\u0026nbspMuso\u0027s\u0026nbspChinese data is a barometer of piracy consumption to come then we would expect to see a continued rise in piracy activity for the rest of the world as more countries enforce covid-19\u0026nbsplockdowns.Globally, average daily torrent downloads from January to February increased significantly by 36 per cent. Since then, more than a third of the world\u0027s population has been placed\u0026nbspin\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspas more countries follow China\u0027s lead in fighting the outbreak.Certain trends have already begun to emerge from the early data, notably in the choice of films people are choosing to watch.\u0026nbspContagion\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspPandemic\u0026nbsphave both proven popular titles, experiencing more than double the usual streaming numbers.Created with Sketch.Words at the window: Social isolation and the Coronavirus Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Agnetha Septimus, Matthew Septimus, and children Ezra and NoraHusband and wife filmmakers, Claire Ince and Ancil McKain pose for a portrait for the series by Shutterstock Staff Photographer, Stephen Lovekin, shot around the Ditmas Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New YorkKhadijah Silver and son EliotAnna Beth Rousakis and daughter Mary RousakisMike Pergola and Denise Pergola with children Henry, Jack, and WillJean Davis and Danny Rosenthal, with children Simone, Naomi, and LeahLisa Draho and Josh Zuckerman, with children Ruby and AvaProfessor and activist Dr Kristin LawlerTom Smith and Laura Ross, with daughters Caroline, Elizabeth, and AbigailCallie Lovekin and Lucas LovekinAgnetha Septimus, Matthew Septimus, and children Ezra and NoraHusband and wife filmmakers, Claire Ince and Ancil McKain pose for a portrait for the series by Shutterstock Staff Photographer, Stephen Lovekin, shot around the Ditmas Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New YorkKhadijah Silver and son EliotAnna Beth Rousakis and daughter Mary RousakisMike Pergola and Denise Pergola with children Henry, Jack, and WillJean Davis and Danny Rosenthal, with children Simone, Naomi, and LeahLisa Draho and Josh Zuckerman, with children Ruby and AvaProfessor and activist Dr Kristin LawlerTom Smith and Laura Ross, with daughters Caroline, Elizabeth, and AbigailCallie Lovekin and Lucas LovekinFigures from other online platforms have shown that viewership has also increased across legitimate streaming sites in the first quarter of 2020.Viewership on live-streaming website Twitch spiked by around 17 per cent compared to the previous quarter​, surpassing 3 billion hours watched for the first time.Statistics compiled by streaming service\u0026nbspStreamlabs\u0026nbsprevealed that hours-watched on YouTube Gaming Live, Facebook Gaming and Mixer also increased by between 4 to 15 per cent.Separate research by analytics firm AppAnnie\u0026nbspthis week showed that the amount of time people spend\u0026nbspon Android smartphones has shot up by almost a fifth in 2020.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK chief medical adviser, Professor Chris Whitty, has said that a vaccine is £one way out of this ... and we all hope that will happen as quickly as possible.US scientists say they have developed a potential coronavirus vaccine that produces antibodies capable of fighting the virus and will apply for ‘investigational new drug’ approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesResearchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine found the vaccine, tested on mice, produced antibodies in quantities thought to be enough to “neutralise” Covid-19 within two weeks of injection.The team are far from alone: the World Health Organisation says there are at least 20 coronavirus vaccines are in developmental stages around the world, with the first human trials already beginning in Seattle, led by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna. The trial is backed by the national institutes of health (NIH) and Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe speed at which Moderna’s vaccine is entering human trials is unprecedented, largely thanks to Chinese scientists sharing the genetic sequence of Sars-CoV-2 — a move that allowed research groups to grow the live virus and study its behaviour. Researchers were given permission to skip the usual animal testing phase.In the UK, scientists from Imperial College London said earlier this month they have a “prototype vaccine” with “encouraging” results that could soon be tested on humans.Dr Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at the university’s department of infectious disease said: “It is a global effort. We are not racing against each other – we are racing against the virus.”But despite the number of teams working at breakneck speed to develop a vaccine, it could still take around 18 months for any potential vaccine to become available to the general public.Anthony Fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases in the US and one of Donald Trump’s top health officials, said the process of developing a vaccine “is going to take a year, year-and-a-half at least”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The phases begin with a small pool of healthy volunteers to test the vaccine for safety and monitor it for adverse effects. Next, a larger pool of several hundred people are tested to monitor how effective the vaccine is, and lastly, the same process is repeated in a pool of several thousand people.Scientists also have to make allowances for variables in the pools of people being tested. Candidates are randomly assigned to either treatment groups or control groups to determine the efficacy of treatments being administered, but some outcomes may prove to be ineffective or unsafe, or both.Ultimately, scientists must still adhered to the strict protocol involved in developing potential vaccines despite the pressure to move quickly. Any drug can only be made available after a national licensing body or the WHO approves it.Dr Simon Clarke, professor or cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, told The Independent: “With vaccines you have to generate an immune response that is protective enough – any old immune response won’t do. It has to be able to protect against subsequent infections when that happens.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus culture from rooftops, windows and balconies Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeA rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeHe added: “I remind people we’ve been trying to find a vaccine for HIV for the best part of 40 years.”There is some light at the end of the tunnel. Last week, a veteran coronavirus research team raised hopes when they found that Covid-19 is not mutating at a level that could make it far more dangerous.Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo pledge £2.5m to help battle virusDr Vineet Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch, told The Independent that the lack of mutation was “good news” because “we could reasonably argue that vaccines would work against most of the strains out there”.Britain is the largest contributor to an international bid to find a coronavirus vaccine, committing a total of £250m to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).The funding was announced after Boris Johnson took part in a video conference of the G20 group, where leaders of the world’s largest economies pledged to deliver a “transparent, robust, coordinated, large-scale and science-based global response in the spirit of solidarity”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Of those, 22 have already shut.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA further administration is now being considered with KPMG among the firms said to be in the running to handle it.Sky News reported that Debenhams could file a notice of intention to appoint administrators as next week but other options are being explored.Mike Ashley funding lawsuit to ‘eliminate Debenhams as a competitor’A spokesperson for the retailer\u0026nbspsaid: Like all retailers, Debenhams is making contingency plans reflecting the extraordinary current circumstances.Our owners and lenders remain highly supportive and whatever actions we may take will be with a view to protecting the business during the current situation.While our stores remain closed in line with government guidance, and the majority of our store-facing colleagues have been furloughed, our website continues to trade and we are accepting customer orders, gift cards and returns.”Debenhams put most of its workforce on furlough last week after closing all 140 of its UK stores as the country entered lockdown to slow the spread of Covid-19.The move means the government is covering up to 80 per cent of employees\u0027 salaries under the Coronavirus Job retention Scheme.The BBC reported this week that Debenhams was to launch a major restructuring after seeking an urgent deal with its landlords.

This is picked up by the thousands of detectors worldwide that measure seismic waves.Thomas Lecocq, a seismologist at the Royal Observatory in Belgium, discovered that ambient seismic noise has fallen by between 30 and 50 per cent in Brussels since the middle of last month, around the time the country closed schools and businesses.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsOther seismologists have found similar noise reductions.Paula Koelemeijer, a London seismologist, said stations in the UK capital had also found noise reductions last month immediately after the lockdown began.The station that has registered the largest reduction is in the City financial district, she said.Air pollution drops in cities as UK begins coronavirus lockdownAnd a detector beside the M4 also recorded a dip in average daytime background seismic noise level, according to Stephen Hicks, an Imperial College London earthquakes expert.Dr Lecocq, who plans now to test whether scientists can obtain better measurements from the Earth’s crust, said the noise level in Brussels was similar to that normally observed only on Christmas Day.Many detector stations are located in quiet areas so that the sounds they pick up are not confused by human activity, but the one in Brussels is in a normally busy area.Dr Lecocq told The Independent that the capacity of “noisy” stations – those affected by human-generated vibrations – to detect smaller earthquake signals was greater since the coronavirus lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He said: “You’ll get a signal with less noise on top, allowing you to squeeze a little more information out of those events.”Satellite images\u0026nbsphave shown that air pollution\u0026nbspplummet as a result of the lack of human activity during the\u0026nbsplockdown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While the disruption lasted approximately 20 minutes the service itself was still operational, but simply not findable due to a DNS resolution failure.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If equality, humanity, honesty and kindness are called Corbynism, then that’s all right with me.”With Sir Keir\u0026nbspthought likely to sideline the hard left if he defeats “continuity Corbyn” candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey as expected on Saturday, Ms Alvarez sent a defiant message to her husband’s supporters not to abandon his cause.“I will never regret our dream of a better quality of life for everybody,” she said.“It is now up to our movement to ensure it does not remain a dream.”Mr Corbyn himself indicated he may resume his role as a backbench rebel under the new leadership, saying: “It depends what the votes are and what the issues are – I always believe in being true to oneself.”He added: “I will be doing my best to encourage others to be active and to stand up for all the causes that I believe so passionately in.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I found her very impressive and she will no doubt do a very good job at a very difficult time.”As deputy chief of defence staff, General Barrons was in charge of the military support for national resilience and security in natural or man-made disasters as well as conflicts.He told The Independent: “The potential risk of global pandemic has been with us for a very long time.\u0026nbspQuestions have to be asked of the government, industry and civil society on the level of preparedness when this pandemic occurred.Coronavirus: Experts cast doubt on UK plan for ‘herd immunity’“We can’t have been completely surprised. In the future we obviously need to be better prepared. But we must not make the mistake of thinking that it’s all just about pandemics.

It was set up 10 years ago by the Cameron government and ownership is shared between its staff, the Cabinet Office and the charity Nesta which deals with innovations.David Halpern, BIT’s chief executive, and a member of the Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) outlined to the BBC on 11 March the approach of shielding vulnerable people until enough of the country’s population had been infected with Covid-19, and immunity would be acquired to halt its spread.“There’s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don’t catch the disease. By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population,”\u0026nbsphe said.On the same day Dominic Cummings, the chief advisor to Boris Johnson, is reported to have brought up the issue of herd immunity in a discussion with tech industry leaders. Two days later the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told BBC Radio 4 that one of\u0026nbspthe key things we need to do\u0026nbspis to “build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission”.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, insisted a few days later that achieving herd immunity was not a stated policy. Instead, he said, “in the coming weeks” people over the age of 70 will be told to self-isolate.Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the medical journal Lancet told the Commons Science and Technology Select Committee at the end of last month that SAGE, despite being chaired by the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, had little input from public health doctors and medical officers. The dominant voices advising the government, he said, were mathematical modellers and behavioural scientists, including Dr Halpern.“There is evidence on modelling and on behavioural science, but I don’t see the evidence from the public health community or from the clinical community,” he said.“We thought we could have a controlled epidemic. We thought we could manage that epidemic over the course of March and April, push the curve to the right, build up herd immunity and that way we could protect people. The reason why that strategy was wrong is it didn’t recognise that 20 per cent of people infected would end up with severe critical illness. The evidence was there at the end of January.”A senior Whitehall official involved with Covid-19 planning held, however, that Dr Halpern was explaining the theory of “herd immunity”, not advocating it. He said “a lot will come out in the future about what happened, not just the role of advisers, but politicians as well, I have no doubt that a lot of it very interesting for the public”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Quite right too.And boy, are they going to need it once they’re in the full glare of the LA-based paparazzi, who operate under far fewer legal restrictions than those based in the UK.One was caught trespassing at the school of a celebrity’s child, another scaled a wall at Jenner Aniston’s to try to get a shot of her, other stars have had their cars blocked by paps, singer Niall Horan was dragged to the floor by one at LAX airport and they’ve been known to sit outside doctor’s surgeries to snap someone famous coming out.So good luck with all that, Harry and Meghan.You’re about to realise how protected you were in the UK, both by the stricter laws and the ring of steel that shields the Royal Family.Little wonder that the rumoured bill for their personal security is estimated at around £million a year.Add in the cost of other staff, general living expenses and the £.million they said they would repay for the refurbishment of Frogmore “cottage” — now sitting empty — and it’s clear they are spending money like water with no discernible means of actually earning much to make up any shortfall.Which, once the Covid- crisis has passed, means they will be vulnerable to the attention of the super-rich.And we all know how that worked out for Prince Andrew.But perhaps the greatest concern for the Duke and Duchess of Sussexis that, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the world’s attention is erted where and the news of their move to LA was greeted with a collective, “so what ”A mass disinterest which, when you’re “former royals for sale”, is very worrying indeed.FORMER Love Island star Maura Higgins has revealed she could get any boy she wanted at school.“I’ve always been very, very confident,” she says.Following her recent appearance on Dancing On Ice, reports that she’d split from boyfriend Curtis Pritchard were followed by rumours that she’d got a little too close to her married skating partner Alex Demetriou.But Maura claims they are “just friends”, adding: “Alex and I are so close – we’ve trained together for months . . . but that’s it.”I’m sure his we, fellow skater Carlotta Edwards, will now feel deeply reassured.Yes, it’s come to this. Even the Christmas-themed ones on Amazon were sold out.So instead, like millions of other homes across the country, I have been busying myself with all “those” household tasks we steadfastly ignore for the rest of the year.The patio is sparkling clean, all those cupboards where Lord Lucan could be hiding have been cleared out, my bike looks brand new and I actually baked a pie, which has rarely happened before.I have even vacuumed our mattresses. The bedbugs are distraught.WE already know the seriousness of the Covid- plague and the devastating effect it’s having on so many lives so I thought that, for the purposes of sanity, I’d briefly concentrate on some of the positives coming out of this unprecedented experience.Not least that it’s turned the world in to a village sharing a vast, water cooler moment in time.So: Reasons to be cheerful, part one.It’s Tiger King on Netflix and will while away a few gobsmacking hours.FACEBOOK and other social media s are wonderful at keeping us in touch with friends and loved ones during this partial lockdown.But I do wish they’d switch off the “your memories” facility until further notice.We keep getting reminders of all the lovely places we visited before Covid- changed le as we know it.But then again, perhaps it gives us something to look forward to when, fingers crossed, things finallyto normal.A NUMBER of viewers have complained that actor Martin Compston’s Glaswegian accent in BBC drama The Nest is “ridiculous”, “slightly forced” and “not authentic”.For the record, Martin – best known for playing Line Of Duty’s Steve Arnott with a London accent – was born and raised just outside, er, Glasgow.Proof,needed, that certain social media users are one episode short of a boxset.MODEL Kaia Gerber has adopted two puppies, one of which she referred to as her “quarantine buddy”.“Now is a great time to foster a puppy in need!” she posted.Seriously  And what happens to them when she’s back travelling the world with her work  A puppy is for le, not just for coronavirus.THIS is Glaswegian Ken McCallum, the new boss of MI.For some reason, the Gareth Malone look-alike’s age is being kept secret, so let’s take a guess, shall we  Er,  BOND star Daniel Craig says he got in to shape for the role with a diet of fermented cabbage, chilli paste and eggs.Ugh.One suspects his we Rachel Weisz will have no trouble with this period of social distancing.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I even have iodine tablets.See  I chose THE WRONG BLOODY APOCALYPSE.I thought it was going to be nuclear bombs raining down on us. And I was well ready.But when the Four Horsemen eventually turned up, it wasn’t with nukes. It was with a bit of a bad cough.What I needed wasn’t a Geiger counter, but a ventilator. And paracetamol. How was I to know Probably because I was a Cold War kid and that’s how we all expected to go back then.Anyway, I might put my Geiger counter on Ebay.I’m asking £ or six rolls of toilet paper and some tinned tomatoes. And a Twix.And so here, in week two of the Great Lockdown, I’m pretty much useless.Unless you want to know the proportions of lead and concrete needed to minimise the radioactive fallout from a ten-megaton blast.One thing is bothering me, however.And that’s the Old Bill getting a bit overzealous in pursuit of people. Ordinary people going for a walk.A friend of mine was walking her dog in a London park when two rozzers turned up on horseback.They told her not to throw a ball for the dog.Why not  Because it might have Covid- on its fur and bump into someone .Um . . . might not the police horses also have Covid- on their fur And then there’s the Derbyshire coppers sending a drone to harass some bloke out for a walk in the Peak District. Entirely alone, not a danger to anyone.The chief plod of Derbyshire has been defending his force’s actions.Meanwhile, other forces have been naming and shaming the alleged “covidiots” on social media.I don’t think the Old Bill have ever been happier. They’re loving this.I know we must not take unnecessary journeys.I know we need to employ social distancing.People holding house parties and so on is crazy.I think the vast majority of us grasp this.But this is a tricky time. The public needs to be kept onside.We need to be able to respect our police, just as we respect the Government’s advice.Overzealous behaviour by the coppers does not help.Why should a bloke not swig from a can of beer in a park How is that more dangerous than taking your dog for a walk Why is being totally alone in a wilderness area a danger to other people There needs to be some common sense employed.Meanwhile, regarding my Geiger counter, the batteries are included.And for an extra roll of bog paper I’ll throw in the full-colour chart showing the ious symptoms of radiation poisoning.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.THE wildle is just loving this lockdown, though.I’ve never seen so many foxes, badgers and deer out where I live.It’s because people aren’t going out.And I like the thought that the animals are always there, just waiting for us humans to come a cropper.I also enjoyed the patrol of goats which have taken over the Welsh resort of Llandudno.Watch your backs, you goats.MIDDLE CLASS: Sacking the nanny and the cleaner in case they give the virus to Cressida, two, and Wolfgang, four.Growing hydroponic vegetables in the annex, enough for half a salad by next Feb.Writing letters of complaint to the board of Waitrose about the unavailability of dried black limes and manchego.Stockpiling hummus.Cycling round the local park wearing chemical warfare gear.Trying, desperately, to sell their three-bedroom cottage in North East Italy.Washing their hands every  seconds with Duchy Original Organic Fairtrade Hand Sanitiser.Trying to fit a face mask on Corbyn, their Labrador.Removing the back seats from the Range Rover for the next click and collect.Hoping to get a nice postcard from their oldest son, Oliver, who has been on his gap year in Wuhan.WORKING CLASS: Getting p***ed watching Netflix.ONE of the surprising benefactors of this virus has been the BBC.Only a couple of months ago its very existence was in doubt.The Government was planning to decriminalise non-payment of its licence fee.People were sick to the back teeth of its patent political bias.But in general, it’s done very well during this crisis.Some of its news programmes have adapted brilliantly.Not Newsnight, obvs, which is still a jabbering gripefest.But the Radio Four PM programme has been excellent.It’s presenter, Evan Davis, has an affable calmness – and he asks the right questions.Radio Five has adapted well, too – although I’d junk ALL of the sport right now.Butonly the BBC could cover politics with the same lack of bias it is now using to cover the pandemic.I SAW that a bully Builder Who Shot His Partner, Their Two Daughters, Four and Two, Their Pet Dog and Then Himself At Their £, Sussex home was described as “a nasty Piece Of Work” by a Neighbour.Sheesh!

And we’ve only been under lockdown for a week or so.But I’m slightly with Piers Morgan when he says “man up”.My dad was a working-class bloke from the North East of England.He got himself into a grammar school and had a chance to go to university. But the war stopped that.At  he was serving on a motor torpedo boat in the channel.My mum, meanwhile, was evacuated as a kid, taken away from her parents. Then her house was bombed flat.In  the Luftwaffe bombed our cities every night, death raining down.That strikes me as being real hardship.All we’ve been asked to do is sit on the sofa for a while, eating crisps.I think we can probably get through this, you know.THINGS nobody has been talking about, anywhere, since the crisis hit us.This last one is the most interesting.At times like this nobody caresyou’re black, white, brown, gay, transgender, Muslim or Jewish.Everyone grasps that we’re all in this together.If only, once this is over, we could understand that we’re STILL in all this together.And that identity politics simply causes unnecessary isions between us.ONCE this is all over the Chinese have a few questions to answer.Mainly about the degree to which their government has not been honest.Either about the start of the virus, deaths and the rate of infection right now.And what happened to the heroic Chinese doctors who tried to warn the world  At least one has disappeared.China is a devious, totalitarian and hostile country.

Even the mandible was fractured.The surgeon first aligned the jaw area and fixed it with plates and screws, before the vertical and horizontal buttresses of the face were reconstructed.He added: Then the orbital blowout was repaired and plated.Finally, the soft tissue of the lips and nose were reconstructed.The farmer is said to be recovering well, and his soft tissue is expected to heal in two or three weeks, while the bones are expected to be repaired in two or three months time.Dr Ghosh added: The external appearance of the patient will improve with time as swelling reduces.The bony alignment has come good. He has performed many similar complex surgeries, including the reattachment of the hand of a four-year-old boy injured by a grass cutter in early February.Previously, a Brit teen whose jaw was left dangling by a flap of skin after being broken in half by a horse showed off results of her reconstructive surgery.And where, a teen who was left with % all over body burns in a house fire hopes for a miracle surgery to help him see again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He hasn’t thought it through no matter how many chins of mine he might think he can sht, it ain’t worth spilling perfectly good lager or ales.Nevertheless,that hyperactive chancer can unite the nation, then someone like me who doesn’t go at ramming-speed the whole time can surely help. He’s the hare, I’m the tortoise.But what this is all about is morale. Morale is important: it’s the key component of any battle and that’s what we are in the middle of right now.And as we near the end of our second week in national solitary confinement, I imagine tempers may be fraying, time might be hanging heavy, maybe the way you’re rubbing along has got you chafing a bit: I know I am, I gave up bathing last weekend, I’m on my own, who cares what I smell like.So, here’s a cut out and loose guide to how to keep your morale up and avoid those moments which lord knows you’ll regret, because it’s not like you can go down the pub and moan to your mates about what happened.Dishwasher stacking disputes. You think the knives should point up not down.The amount of times people can fall out over this sort of simple day-to-day admin in normal le is something I’ve heard from my regular drinkers time and time again, so no doubt in lockdown-land this one is raging all day, every day.You know what: forget it. It ain’t worth it. Simply rule yourself out of stacking or emptying the dishwasher – problem solved.Deciding what to watch on the TV. We live in an age of a billion channels and nothing to watch. And they’re not making any more TV either: even Eastenders could grind to a halt. Yes that’s how serious this whole thing is. So whoever has control of the TV rules the roost.The remote is the key to this problem. Seize control: seeing as you aren’t going anywhere or doing anything, superglue the remote to the hand you use the least and retain control of the TV.This may seem extreme but it’ll simply mean there’s one great big argument when you reveal what you’ve done, rather than the long slow drip drip drip of anger about your third week of watching Homes Under The Hammer.Ironing and or folding the laundry. Ironing, for some, is a % flash point. This is how the argument runs. You leave something out to dry, then some thoughtless Herbert chucks it all in a laundry basket in a heap and you have to iron it.Immediately a row ensues about why there’s no need to iron tracksuit bottoms anyway and remember the time you burned that nylon shirt because you had the iron on too hot you idiot.Compromise. Now here’s the thing. It’s not like you’ve got anywhere to be. It’s not like your glad rags are going to get any attention over the next few days.Maybe you’re a slave to fashion and were looking forward to moving from your spring to your summer wardrobe. Whatever that means. But there is no need to iron stuff right now. None. Zero.So put the iron down. Unless of course, it’s something you like doing to calm the nerves, pass the time, inject some sense of order into what is currently a formless existence. In other words, let the ironer iron. But onlytotally necessary. Remember, in the end would you rather be right or happy  And the answer to that is happy. Unless of course what makes you happy is being right. But you get my point.And remember, chins up Britain, all of them.Hats off to all the people who two weeks ago were panicking and spreading rumours about the army being deployed.During the fortnight these Scary Maries were crying into their soda waters about imminent martial law the army quietly got on with setting up a brand-new hospital.

And we have a National Health Service to look after those who need care.A mobilisation never before seen in peacetime is under way across our health service and beyond. In the NHS our dedicated staff are pulling out all the stops to treat the patients we have and prepare for the surge we know is coming.We are now looking after more than , patients in hospital with confirmed coronavirus — a staggering increase compared with just a few weeks ago.That is more coronavirus patients than the number of hospitalised heart attack, stroke and cancer patients combined.And in a matter of weeks hospitals have managed to free up a further , beds, a third of all those normally available, for future patients with coronavirus.Of course, most patients the health service is continuing to look after have some condition other than coronavirus.And it is important that other patients still come forward for the urgent and emergency care they need without delay.Increasing our critical care capacity for those who are sickest is a top priority.And we are setting up new hospitals at a rate never seen before.The new NHS Nightingale in London is the most visible example of the extraordinary effort that is under way to tackle coronavirus.The NHS has joined forces with the military to achieve in days what normally takes years.More such hospitals are in train across the country — in Bristol, in Yorkshire, in Birmingham and in Manchester. I hope they won’t be needed, but we’re building them in case they are.They are an insurance policy in case the surge plans at existing hospitals are not enough.But these new facilities and kit are nothing without the staff that make the NHS what it is today — the institution our nation rightly holds most dear.More than , former nurses, doctors and other NHS staff have heeded the call to re-enlist for the battle against coronavirus.And many thousands of student nurses and medical students will be putting their skills and education into practice early as part of the enormous effort that is under way to save more lives.But the NHS cannot win this war alone. Companies and the Government are now pulling together to get us the extra equipment and supplies the NHS needs. British manufacturers are retooling production lines to turn out protective kit for doctors, nurses and other staff, giving their all on the front line.Commercial rivalries are being put aside as firms co-operate to develop new ventilators and other vital supplies.Labs are expanding their testing capacity, so NHS staff knowthey can safely get back to work.The public are backing our staff at this time of enormous pressure.I know how much it means to the nurses, doctors, therapists, cleaners, pharmacists, paramedics and countless others giving their all to fight coronavirus that the whole nation is behind them in this battle.The support of Sun readers will help sustain them in the days and weeks ahead.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealSo on behalf of the NHS, a thank you too to The Sun, for throwing its weight behind the Clap for Carers campaign to give NHS heroes the recognition they deserve.But the practical actions that iniduals and families take in the weeks ahead will also make all the dference.As other countries have shown, no health service in the world could cope with the number of patients who would need treatmentbetween us we failed to slow the spread of coronavirus.That is why the Government’s measures to stop people meeting and passing on the virus are so important.Nobody is finding this easy — whether it is missing a drink with friends in the pub, Sunday lunch with the family or uncertainty over jobs and wages this epidemic has created for so many.There are early signs this is working but this is a marathon not a sprint. What we need to remember is that right now every single one of us can be a le-saver just by following the medical advice.Every time you wash your hands you could keep someone off of a ventilator.

Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.People may have a  sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.Last night deputy chief medical officer John Van-Tam explained there was no evidence that wearing a mask stops the spread of the virus.Speaking at the daily press conference in No, he said: Yes it is true that we do see very large amounts of mask wearing particularly in Southeast Asia but we have always seen that for many decades and it is entirely wired into some cultures that masks are worn quite frequently in open spaces.

That was  down from . in February. A reading  below  signals a contraction.The contraction experienced was so sharp that it indicates the slide in activity was faster than during the financial crisis.The economy is “now almost certain to experience a deep contraction in the second quarter of the year” according to the authors of the survey.That would put the UK on course for a recession of unprecedented scale and depth, some economists predict. A recession is defined as two quarters of contraction in output or GDP in a row.“The services sector was sucked into a black hole and flung into the unknown by the forceful impact of the Covid- coronavirus, affecting every area of supply chains from transport to purchasing levels and job creation,” said Duncan Brock at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply which helped compile the survey.Mr Brock added: “The likelihood of a global recession is now a given, though its duration and severity has yet to reveal itself. One thing is for certain, with the lowest business optimism for over  years, the immediate outlook for the services sector is beyond grim.”The fall in activity had a knock-on effect on jobs, with the companies surveyed shedding more employees than at any point since , despite Government guarantees to cover  per cent of the salaries of furloughed workers.Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said: “There were numerous reports from survey respondents that placing staff on furlough had helped to mitigate more widespread job losses in March.“However, employment levels across the service sector still dropped at the fastest pace for more than a decade, reflecting some forced redundancies and the non-replacement of departing staff amid widespread hiring freezes.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said the UK needed to face the trade-off between harming the young versus the old. Describing the stark choices facing the government, he says that long, indefinite periods of lockdown could cause more harm than the virus itself by leading to soaring unemployment, domestic violence, food poverty and mental illness.Speaking to the Times, Professor Medley said: “We will have done three weeks of this lockdown so there’s a big decision coming up on April .In broad terms are we going to continue to harm children to protect vulnerable people, or not  “The measures to control [the disease] cause harm. The principal one is economic, and I don’t mean to the economy generally, I mean to the incomes of people who rely on a continuous stream of money and their children.” Professor Medley has described the choice facing ministers as a trade-off between harming the young or the old.In the last fortnight, nearly a million people have applied for Universal Credit benefits.At the same time, millions of other workers have been furloughed as businesses struggle to cope with the fall-out of social distancing measures.  “If we carry on with lockdown it buys us more time, we can get more thought put into it, but it doesn’t resolve anything — it’s a placeholder,” he continued. The public health expert added that there is no way to relax lockdown rules, such as allowing people toto work and schools to re-open, without a surge in infections.

Deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said said the government’s clear advice is that it is not necessary despite an apparent surge in use of the masks. The expert issued the strongest official advice yet on the popular protective wear, as worried Brits snap them up.   “We do not recommend face masks for general wearing by the public Mr Van-Tam said. The White House is reportedly set to advise citizens in US hotspots to wear face masks, while the World Health Organisation is reviewing its guidance. But Downing Street today said there was no planned change in UK guidance The professor explained that while the masks were popular among the public trying to avoid catching the virus, there was no evidence they prevent the spread of the virus among people who are well. Prof Van-Tam said the practice seemed wired into some South East Asian cultures but there was no evidence it helped stop the spread of Covid-. He said: There is no evidence that general wearing of face masks by the public who are well affects the spread of the disease in our society. What matters is social distancing. He added: In terms of the hard evidence and what the UK Government recommends, we do not recommend face masks for general wearing by the public. Prof Van-Tam said: “This has been a controversial area in pandemic preparedness and planning for the  years that I’ve been involved in it.  “Indeed I was on the phone this morning to a colleague in Hong Kong who’s a professor there who’s done the evidence review for the World Health Organisation on face masks. “We are of the same mind - that there is no evidence that general wearing of face masks by the public who are well affects the spread of the disease in our society. What matters right now of course is social distancing “Yes it is true that we do see very large amounts of mask wearing, particularly in south east Asia, but we have always seen that for many decades and it is entirely wired into some cultures that masks are worn frequently. “In terms of the hard evidence and what the UK government recommends, we do not recommend face masks for general wearing by the public. It comes after Boris Johnson ’s official spokesman said earlier today: “I’m not aware of any plans to change our own guidance on the wearing of masks. “Our advice remains you should wash your hands regularly for  second with soap and water and steps you should take in terms of catching any coughs or sneezes.” Today new official figures recorded another dark day for UK, as the death toll increased to ,, with Britain suffering its deadliest day yet with  people dying from coronavirus in  hours.

In the video, uploaded to the website Birmz Is Grime, the ft EE mast in Birmingham is fully ablaze. Police say they are not yet sure what started to fire although onlookers say it was deliberately started following concerns over health risks the network could bring. The electromagnetic radiation used by mobile phone technologies has led to worries among conspiracy theorists that they can cause certain types of cancer.Some have also linked G to the coronavirus outbreak, although the Government says there is aposno credible evidenceapos to support this belief.There is also no scientic evidence that G technology poses any threat to human health in general and it was confirmed as safe by the radiation watchdog last month. Emergency services were called to the blaze on Spring Road in the Sparkhill area of the city at .pm last night. Firefighters battled to douse the flames for two hours while police closed the road to protect traffic. One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: A lot of people donapost want G in the area, Iaposm not surprised somebody torched it. It was a large scale fire and was quite frightening seeing this huge tower up in flames.  I know people are concerned over the health implications G might bring, thereaposs talk of it causing cancer and things like that. But thereaposs been no proof so I donapost know what people are playing at. If another goes up, it will probably just get burned straight back down again. The blaze erupted after posts on social media encouraging people to burn G masts.This afternoon DCMS tweeted: We are aware of inaccurate information being shared online about G. There is absolutely no credible evidence of a link between G and coronavirus. It also shared a link to a fact-checking website which debunked the theory. Earlier this week the Government said it was cracking down on fake news in relation to coronavirus. Harmful narratives posted online by supposed aposexpertsapos were spreading like wildfire, officials said. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said misinformation undermined medical advice to stay at home to protect lives. He added: We’re working with social media companies, and I’ll be pressing them this week for further action to stem the spread of hoods and rumours which could cost lives. UK mobile network providers also warned against the spread of the aposbaselessapos conspiracy theory.Several videos claiming to show G towers on fire were posted to a page on Facebook, which encouraged others to do the same.The page was created yesterday and taken down by Facebook this morning. Mobile UK, the trade body which represents network providers, said it is aposconcerning that certain groups are using the Covid- pandemic to spread  rumours and theories about the safety of G technologiesapos. More worryingly some people are also abusing our key workers and making threats to damage infrastructure under the pretence of claims about G, a statement said.  This is not acceptable and only impacts on our ability as an industry to maintain the resilience and operational capacity of the networks to support mass home working and critical connectivity to the emergency services, vulnerable consumers and hospitals. It continued: The theories that are being spread about G on social media are baseless and are not grounded in accepted scientic theory. Research into the safety of radio signals including G, which has been conducted for more than  years, has led to the establishment of human exposure standards including safety factors that protect against all established health risks. Facebook said the banned page was deleted for breaching its policies because it has the potential to cause real world harm.

Meghan has already given her voice to a new Disney film, which hits the small screen today, and fans are hoping more acting roles may be in the pipeline. But there is one type of job Harry has reportedly told their agent Nick Collins they will not do.  A source told the Daily Mail that while the easy storyline many companies want to focus on it Meghan and Harryaposs decision to quit royal le, theyaposre refusing to do anything that could be seen as negative towards the Queen and the rest of the Firm.The source told the newspaper: Offers have come flooding in to Collins for Harry and Meghan. They are worth tens of millions of dollars and some offers are absolutely in their wheelhouse of charity ideas, however some are straight up advertising and marketing promotions and commercials.  And of course having a narrative about Harry and Meghan either reflecting on their royal links or stepping away is an easy storyline. However, Harry has instructed his and Meghanaposs team to nix anything that in any way could be negative towards the royals. Essentially anything that is negative to the Queen, Prince Charles, his brother or the throne is off limits. It shows that even though he has stepped away from royal le, he does not want to upset his grandmother or father. Meghan reportedly didnapost receive a penny for her first non-royal role, the narration of Disneynatureaposs Elephant - which she recorded before the couple officially quit.

The mum, from Wales, said she had to abandon her trolley of food for her son after waiting an hour in a queue. Speaking to WalesOnline, she said : “It was a nightmare and so embarrassing. “The letter says it can be used in Tesco or Asda and my nearest shop is Tesco. “It was so embarrassing, I had five staff in Tesco around me and a queue of customers behind me. I queued for ages because it is so busy. “I had to leave all the shopping and go to Asda. That’s about half an hour walk away. I had to go to Asda and start again.” Schools across the UK have been forced to shut their doors following the nationwide lockdown and children who were due free school meals have been forced to find other ways to get them. The available options include vouchers, bank transfers and “grab and go” packed lunches distributed from “hub” schools. Although the letter says the vouchers are redeemable at either Tesco or Asda, the council later claried that parents had to check which voucher they had been issued. She said she took the voucher and the letter from Vale of Glamorgan council with her to the Tesco store on Port Road, Barry, but voucher in lieu of payment was refused at the till. The mum said her son, who has just finished year six, had been getting a cold packed lunch delivered to the house since the schools shut. “It was brilliant, they dropped it off, no problem, then yesterday nothing was delivered and then we got the letter and voucher today.” Her partner said: We received a letter this morning saying we’d get £ and saying we could spend the voucher at Tesco or Asda. We didn’t know anything about it until we had the letter.”  A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesman said that although the letter clearly says the vouchers can be used at Tesco or Asda, this is not true and parents have to check whether they have been given a Tesco or an Asda voucher. “The council is not aware of the detail of this case, but the vouchers are specically for use in either Tesco or Asda as they are issued by one of these supermarkets. “The recipient cannot choose which outlet they would prefer to shop in. This fact is indicated in the correspondence sent to parents and on the vouchers themselves.” He said the parent carer of every child entitled to a free school meal will now receive a voucher to the value of £ a fortnight - the equivalent of £. a day. “The council is working with Tesco and Asda and is issuing vouchers which can be redeemed at each retailer’s respective shops. We are continuing to investigate how this offer could be extended to include additional retailers.

The Duke Of York, , who quit royal duties over his ­relationship with the sex offender, has been formally asked to talk about Epstein on a cable network series. Insiders say Andrew, who had a ­disastrous interview on BBC Newsnight, was warned by lawyers to avoid others. TV channel Letime is making a four-part documentary that will look at Epstein’s le, business and social circle. Insiders claim they have spoken to ex-employees as well as victims, who have filed civil lawsuits against him.Surviving Jeffrey Epstein is the working title of the project by the network that first publicised allegations of sexual abuse and assault against singer R. Kelly in  with Surviving R. Kelly.  It is understood as many as ten victims have held talks about appearing on camera. Others are considering being shot in silhouette. An LA-based source said: “Andrew has been asked to appear to discuss his friendship, but there has been no formal response.His legal team have told him to conduct no more interviews after he spoke to the BBC. There is a concern anything he says on tape or camera becomes potential legal material for the many civil cases facing Epstein, and FBI questions regarding Andrew.

But fans were distracted by one of the framed pictures he had on the piano behind him as he recorded the message on an iPad propped up on some books and a red box. Alongside pictures of his sons Princes William and Harry, his grandchildren and a snap from his wedding day to Camilla, sits what looks like a framed black and white silhouette picture. Many were left wondering what an earth it could be, and it didnapost take long for others to start making jokes about it. Itaposs unclear what the picture is of, but one theory is that the odd appearance has been caused by right reflecting off the glass. But other fans had a whole dferent issue with the photo and commented on the fact Charles is using the piano as somewhere to display his pictures. One wrote: Also what kind of use is that for a piano   During his speech, Charles praised the incredible work of the NHS and Army for getting the vital hospital build and ready to go in just nine days. He said: It is without doubt a spectacular and almost unbelievable feat of work in every sense, from its speed of construction in just nine days to its size and the skills of those who have created it. An exampleever one was needed of how the impossible can be made possible and how we can achieve the unthinkable through human will and ingenuity.  The creation of this hospital is the result of an extraordinary collaboration and partnership between NHS managers, the military and all those involved to create a centre on a scale that has never been seen before in the United Kingdom. He also said he was one of the lucky ones as he only suffered mild symptoms but admitted for some it will be a much harder journey. He said he is therefore relieved patients will have the technical care they need and every chance toto a normal le.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Royal Mail has announced strict new rules to its service which will start next week. Changes to opening times and deliveries will be made amid the coronavirus pandemic. Royal Mail previously revealed changes about handling and delivering mail during the crisis. These included only one person being allowed in a Royal Mail delivery vehicle at any one time and an extra emphasis on postal workers washing their hands when entering and leaving Royal Mail buildings. Acting on public health authority advice, Royal Mail says it has adopted enhanced disinfectant cleaning of communal areas in all Royal Mail sites on a daily basis and to minimise contact, customer signatures are no longer required, and any parcel too big to fit through a letterbox will be placed outside their door.  However from next week stricter guidelines will be put into place, though Post Office services are unaffected by the announcement. Here are all the changes as stated on the Royal Mail website. Changes to opening hours and closures To protect the health and safety of our people and the general public, from Monday  April, we are changing the opening times of our Customer Services Points in our local delivery offices. Our largest locations will be open between .-.am. All other Customer Service Points will be open between .-:am. All will be closed on Wednesday and Sunday. To support the Government’s advice to stay at home and avoid non-essential journeys, we urge customers to only visit Customer Service Points where absolutely necessary. As a reminder, we can also redeliver your item for free.  Schedule your redelivery here. Longer retention period for parcels To give you longer to collect or have your item redelivered, we are temporarily extending the retention period to   calendar days from Monday  April before items are ed to sender. This applies to the following:Items we’ve left a ‘Something for You’ card Items that have a ‘Surcharge to Pay’ Items that have a ‘Customs Charge to Pay’ Local Collect items where the parcel is addressed to the Customer Service PointSpecial Delivery Due to increased absence levels, we’ve reviewed our timed guarantees for Special Delivery Guaranteed by am and pm services and will make the following changes:For items posted from Tuesday  March  onwards, our guaranteed delivery for Special Delivery Guaranteed by .am the next working day will change to by .pm the next working day*. Our guaranteed delivery for Special Delivery Guaranteed by .pm will change to by .pm the next working day*.*existing postcode exceptions apply  Signing for and receiving items In order to protect both our people and customers as much as possible, we are minimising contact during delivery. We will not be handing over our hand-held devices to customers to capture signatures but instead log the name of the person accepting the item. Additionally, for all customers where we need to deliver any item that won’t fit through your letterbox, we will place your item at your door. Having knocked on your door, we will then step aside to a safe distance while you retrieve your item. This will ensure your item is delivered securely rather than being left outside. Delivering to care homes The Government has introduced measures to protect our most vulnerable groups, including those in residential care. These include limiting all but essential access to care homes for external contractors. We recognise that post is important to the elderly, particularly those away from their friends and families in care homes. Therefore, to support the effort to keep the mail moving but prevent the spread of Coronavirus, we are making arrangements to deliver to a central pointrather than inidual addresses within care homes from th March. These changes will help to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of our people and the vulnerable in society. Leaflets and unaddressed mail We will deliver unaddressed door to door advertising mailings to customers who are receiving addressed letters or parcels at the same time, wherever practically possible. Door to door mailings provide a very valuable service to small businesses and companies of all kinds as they seek to provide their goods and services. Many small businesses need that support now more than ever. They want to send it, many consumers want to receive it. Door to door mailings also include important communications from local government. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus."},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather glorious sunny 20c","story":"NewsUK weather: Glorious sunny C weekend ahead but lockdown Brits urged to ignore itBritain is set to bask in a warm weekend with sunshine and temperatures of C - but the prime minister and health chiefs are desperately urging people to continue to abide by the coronavirus lockdown guidanceShareCommentsByJeremy Culley:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsA C heat blast is set to sweep over Britain on Sunday\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The cityaposs most famous beach, Bondi, has already been closed after people ignored the guidelines and refused to stay away. Now the areaaposs northern beaches are being used, asit is any other day. In one shocking example, crowds gathered at Fairy Bower pool, after an adolescent Great White Shark was found in Manly. Pet Care business owner Emma Hicks went to the beach after receiving a text from a friend telling her a shark had been found and rescued and taken to the pool area. I arrived to huge crowds surrounding the pool and several staff from the local Sea Le Sanctuary keeping the shark safe and monitoring it. It was later released after one or two days in special care and being assessed as OK to go back to the ocean. In New South Wales leaving your home for anything other than  reasonable excuses including going to work and picking up food shopping, will see you facing either an £, fine or six months in prison. Police Commissioner for News South Wales Mick Fuller said people were still struggling to understand what constitutes exercise.  At a press conference on Thursday, he said: In terms of the new isolation powers, certainly lots of questions about exercise. I don’t get it. He said the government wanted people to keep fit and exercising. “But of courseI said that it’s okay to sit on a park bench, then everyone is going to go to the park. We’re going to end up where we started. On a hot day at Bondi Beach a couple of weekends ago, one person said they were going to go for a swim and we ended up with , people.” He added that while strict measures are in place, police would use their discretion when handing out fines. He said: “Every time a police officer stops someone to ask a question you get this very innate skill of working out whether people are telling you the truth or not. “If someone says, ‘look I’m going to the chemist’ andthe chemist is over there and visible then that’s fine, we’re not a police state.

It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC.

They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over.

Riverside was a shock for them on a December morning and certainly not what a guy like Caniggia was used to!“Caniggia, Ravanelli, Ketsbaia, all the top names that came into the club were brand new. They were great lads, they really were.“It was a bit surreal training against these boys. I was a bit stand-offish because I had a reputation of being a little rash and I wasn’t going to smash Caniggia in training!“He was just left to do his thing and you gave him the respect he deserves.“He basically got to do whatever he wanted around the club. Nobody was going to tell Caniggia he couldn’t do something!“We’d be at training and his five-year-old son would be up with us. We’d be doing a shooting exercise and running out of balls because Caniggia’s son had six at the side kicking them about!”Wilkie also revealed Caniggia’s free reign didn’t stop there and the Argentine was known to enjoy a pre-match cigarette in the Dens Park dressing room.He said: “We had the one cubicle in the changing-room and I used to like my pre-match toilet to just chill out and read the programme to get my mind ready for the game.“I’d always have to wait on Caniggia coming out the toilet because he’d be in there smoking a rolly-up.“He used to just come out with a wee smile on his face, shrug his shoulders and walk past you but that was just the kind of guy he was.“The Italians and the Argentines were horried the British boys would drink beer but they would smoke asit was the healthiest thing going.“They were really fit, though. Caniggia was probably the fittest guy I played with and fans could see that when he scored his first goal against Aberdeen and took his top off.“He was so strong for his age and looked after himself really well.“He was one of the biggest players in the world and it was amazing he was at Dundee.”It was a crucial time in Wilkie’s career but bust-ups with the Bonettis led to him going on loan to Plymouth Argyle, Notts County and Falkirk.But he found his way back to Dens, impressing then-Scotland manager Berti Vogts enough to get a call-up to the national team.“It was dficult for me because I was young and fiery and they were exactly the same,” Wilkie said of clashing with the Bonettis.“I had a couple of fall-outs with them that really came from nothing. It’s disappointing how it ended up because I really quite liked them.“Dario really knew his stuff as a coach and, as an ex-defender, he used to take us away to do bits and pieces in training.“I really enjoyed that. The two times I fell out with them were from silly little things in training that shouldn’t have happened.“My loan moves then came from the fall-outs but I got called back from Falkirk because they’d fallen out with Marco De Marchi and Fan Zhiyi.“When I was on loan at Notts County I’d pretty much given up. I was close to deciding I was done with football because I was fed up.“I was in a bad place. I got injured down there in my first or second game, sat stuck in a hotel and I thought that was me done.“I was only  so I was just a bit naive and immature I guess.

Of course, all clubs have dferent worries financially because they’re all in dferent situations.The least they deserve is clarity.Even in the summer it doesn’t take long for players to be itching to get back to football.The current situation with the coronavirus shutdown is a dferent kettle of fish entirely, though, and poses heightened mental health risks.For that reason, I was delighted to hear Tony Asghar say Dundee United are using a sport psychologist to help players stay positive.Clubs are far more equipped to deal with these things than when I started  years ago.My son Jack and I have been out on our bikes to try to break the boredom of lockdown this week.He’s been doing a lot of running as part of his training programme from Dundee but somehow I think I’ll stick to the pedals!"},{"url":null,"title":"mum recovering from pneumonia claimed angus council initially refused to fix gas because they believed she had coronavirus","story":"A mum recovering from pneumonia feared she #would die# after the council refused to send engineers to fix her gas because they believed she had coronavirus.Katie Reid, , was without adequate heating for days after Angus Council turned her gas off on Monday.The mum-of-one claims the authority had initially refused to send anyone out to fix the problem because they had mistaken her pneumonia for Covid- symptoms.POLL: Do you agree with government #lockdown# imposed due to coronavirus pandemic \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp poll-do-you-agree-with-government-lockdown-imposed-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic embed # secretJjaCHpmwk\" data-secret\"JjaCHpmwk\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"However, after the Tele approached the council on her behalf, the issue was subsequently  repaired.Katie, who lives in a council property in Arbroath#s Culloden Crescent, says she is still struggling to breathe but does not believe she has the virus.Gas engineers acting for Angus Council switched off her supply on Monday night after a carbon monoxide alarm sounded.They were not set toto turn it back on until next week # until the Tele intervened.Katie said: #I#m so grateful honestly # I#ve no words.

castle in line for revamp","story":"A historic rose garden at a north-east tourist attraction is in line for a complete renovation.The rose arbour at Crathes Castle will be redeveloped next year and given a new design, a dferent selection of flowers, and sculptures.Aberdeenshire Council planners have given permission to the National Trust for Scotland to carry out these works, which it says will “enhance the cultural, historic and architectural signicance of the site”.Most of the planting in the garden will be removed except the yew hedges which surround it, with eight flower borders replacing them.They will be laid out in the shape of a Jacobite rose and will form the central feature of the site.In addition, there will be an oversized carved granite reproduction of a Neolithic stone ball, incorporating trickling water, which will be positioned over a reflection point and will act as a focal point of the garden.The sphere is meant to symbolise the story of the continual occupation and use of Crathes Castle throughout the years.New footpaths will also be created in the garden, along with timber bench seating and some ironwork arbours.Planning documents submitted by the Trust stated: “With an out-dated layout and planting scheme, the Rose Garden at Crathes Castle is to be redeveloped to create a new public offering which ties in the historic and contemporary use of the site.“In its entirety the redeveloped garden will enhance the cultural, historic and architectural signicance of the site and wider estate for present and future generations to access and appreciate.”Aberdeenshire Council approved these plans conditionally. The local authority wants an archaeological investigation undertaken before any works are done to make sure there are no items of historical signicance dug up and destroyed.The current layout of the rose garden was finished in the mid-s, and the renovation was meant to commence this spring but has now been delayed.A spokeswoman for the Trust said: “The project will almost certainly be deferred until .“With restrictions likely to be in place for some time yet, we will lose a large part of the growing season this year in which to establish the garden.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.34144826-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.34144826-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.34144826-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.34144826-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"nicola sturgeon tells employers do the right thing as scottish government drafts fresh covid 19 guidance to businesses","story":"The Scottish Government will issue fresh advice to businesses who are continuing to flout new rules around closures in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking at a press conference in Edinburgh, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said more #bespoke and specic# advice will be issued to employers who are still unsure about whether to remain open or not in the wake of the covid- outbreak.It comes as the SNP leader revealed there had been a total of  coronavirus deaths in Scotland #  a rise of six # and warned Scots #it will be some time before le s to normal#.As a result of the pandemic # which has seen Scotland put in lockdown # all non-essential shops across the country have been closed, with businesses told to make their staff work from homethey can.Companies which are vital to the fight against covid- or Scotland#s #economic resilience# are being asked to remain open # but onlythey can do so in line with healthy and safety guidance surrounding covid-.Speaking in Edinburgh on Wednesday, Mrs Sturgeon started by thanking the country#s business community, adding: #The vast majority of businesses have behaved responsibly.#However she added: #I do remain concerned for some workers who have been put under unnecessary and unacceptable pressure.#She announced that the updated guidance being issued by the Scottish Government would not #seek to answer every single questions every business has# but would #set out clear principles# to employers.Mrs Sturgeon said: #Of course there will be some exceptional, nuanced or dficult cases.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"a83 slip recovery work ongoing","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEssential work to make safe the area of hillside that slipped and blocked the A earlier this yearis forging ahead.Taking care to maintain social distancing and to observe all current NHS and government health advice, a team of experts has been carrying out extensive operations to stabilise the slope and construct a back-up catch-pit.Led by Forestry and Land Scotland, the team includes the geotechnical engineers and consultants involved in resilience works where on the Rest and Be Thankful, and partners Transport Scotland and BEAR.FLS Planning Manager, John Hair, said: #We’re channelling a lot of resources into this and are working on it seven days a week to make this area safe.#Over , tonnes of debris landed on the road back in January. It took a lot of clearing up but that loss of material from the hillside presented other problems as well. We’re currently underpinning a -metre stretch of the forest road to strengthen it and prevent any further major collapse.#The landslip channel has been stabilised but, in the event of future extreme weather events potentially affecting this part of the slope, we are constructing a catch pit that aims to prevent debris from reaching the road surface.#Traffic management will be in place for approximately a further two weeks to allow us to complete the catch pit. We will be working on stabilising the forest road for another four weeks after that but will not require any more traffic management.#Currently only one lane of the carriageway is in use.The area of hillside affected is land that FLS looks after but is well away both from those areas that have slipped in the past and from areas where previous mitigation work has been carried out.Engineering assessments indicate that the incident was the result of exceptionally heavy rain causing a section of hillside above the forest road to slump and block a drainage culvert. This resulted in water damming up, overflowing the forest road and reaching the downhill slope, carrying surface material downhill and also creating a channel for more water to travel down at a faster rate.John, added: #This event arose from a very particular set of circumstances that are unlikely to apply to other sites and situations. However, aware as we are of the increasing occurrence of prolonged spells of heavy rain, we have already reviewed and adapted our inspection process to include checks on other forest roads set in similar landscapes.#We are also developing climate change adaptation actions to make the forests and land more resilient and mitigate such risks.#"},{"url":null,"title":"ferry services cant stay afloat forever msp","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFerry operators are facing #signicant losses,# but cannot stay afloat forever without help, the country#s transport secretary has warned.Michael Matheson MSP has added his signature today to a letter from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments warning that some routes could sink unless there is intervention.It has been sent to UK Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps to sound the alarm bell over the future of services in places like the Western Isles.Ferry companies have faced signicant losses since the outbreak of COVID- and the crackdown on travel, restrictions on movements and some freight.Politicians are warning that ferry companies will need to make #decisions# on #loss-making routes# in coming days as carrying on with reduced passengers and staffing numbers may not be sustainable longer term.It comes as CalMac, which offers  vessels serving  routes, has revealed its passenger numbers have dropped by  per cent since new rules on essential ferry travel were put in place.The company has carried just , passengers compared to , for the same period last year, although company MD Robbie Drummond welcomed the fact the public is paying attention to government advice not to travel.The company, he said, remained committed to running #leline services# to the islands.Some of the asks of the UK government include an #immediate and temporary# relaxation of the competition regulations and a confirmation that seafaring companies will qualy for the employee support scheme.Mr Matheson said: #My officials and I have kept in touch with ports and ferry operators over the past few weeks and they have expressed substantial concerns with their operations over this dficult period.#I believe that without further intervention operators will need to take dficult commercial decisions which could be avoided, and that it will be extremely dficult to recover from that after we make it through this crisis.#Current reductions in freight traffic are also a serious issue in their own right.#There is a strong case for the UK Government to do more to support this vital sector during these unprecedented times and I look forward to their response on this important matter.#"},{"url":null,"title":"helpful advice for students during coronavirus pandemic","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhether it is worry over money, exams, or family and friends – perhaps all three – the COVID- pandemic is a stressful time for students.While many will be at home with their families, and subsequently isolated from their natural peer support, many others will be unable to leave their student accommodation or indeed, in some cases, be unable toto their home country.Student services across the country are going to great s to communicate crucial advice and support, but it is incumbent on us all to help.Through the wonders of digital connectivity, isolation does not have to mean loneliness.Now is a good time to make that phone call, send that text or private message you’ve been meaning to send.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post comments.ldquoThe real challenge will be to ensure likely local residents businesses are aware and can gain access to participate."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-measures-supermarkets-taking-keep-people-safe","story":"Currently, item limit restrictions and priority hours are in place across all major supermarkets

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Over the last couple of days he talked of getting people back to work after Easter - a ldquobeautul timeline - at the same time as threatening to put New York, currently the worst affected state, into complete quarantine.Donrsquot get me wrong, I was relieved when the  trillion government support package his administration drew up was finally signed off. But based on what family and friends are telling us on daily calls, itrsquos going to take more than a one-off , cheque for low and middle earners for this to be anything other than a catastrophe for the worldrsquos richest country.The coronavirus trajectory is looking particularly ominous in the US, with its case rate the highest in the worldand a death rate that is already on course to outpace Italy.No country can escape the devastating effects of this virus, of course, no health service is not at risk of being overwhelmed. But as anyone who has spent signicant time there will know and understand, the US is a nation spectacularly ill-suited to a pandemic of this nature and magnitude. Even without the addition of Donald Trump.Indeed, the virus is already exposing many of US societyrsquos in-built weaknesses. Most fundamentally, the non-universal healthcare system that means millions of Americans have no way to pay for treatment should they become ill. Even those who do have medical insurance could find themselves with huge, le-ruining bills, depending on their medical history and policy exclusions. At a time like this, a complex, profit-drivensystem which links healthcare with employment status is particularly likely to fail.The notoriously ungenerous welfare system only compounds this. Many people will feel compelled to keep working rather than following instructions to stay at home. The additions to unemployment benefit announced in the support package are unlikely to provide much reassurance for those in this situation.Demographics is also key. Much of the interior of this vast country, including many of the southern states and rural areas, are poor and poorly resourced to a level that would astound many Europeans. If they are short of ventilators and hospital beds in New York, I dread to think what it will be like in rural Arkansas and Mississippi, where higher proportions of the population are elderly, infirm, unemployed and uninsured.But, as Mr Trumprsquos popularity in some of these places affirms, there are other fundamental issues at play. Many Americans distrust the very idea of the state, and their in-built inidualism may make them balk at the idea of having freedoms curtailed. They have no experience of the state having this much direct control over their lives, no experience in living memory of sacricing personal freedoms, as Europeans did during the Second World War. I note with concern that in some parts of the US there has been a rush on guns as well as toilet paper.This is also the most ided of nations, along political, geographical, economic and religious lines, which plays into a narrative of suspicion and rage. Only two weeks ago, while visiting the southern states, I spoke to people who believed coronavirus had been created by China in retaliation for US trade tarfs. Others talked of it being a plague sent by God to punish sinners.Even a well-run administration would have been up against it. As it stands, Mr Trumprsquos response, strewn with delay, contrary messages and personal insults, may already have cost lives.Despite the worry I feel for my American family, I want to end on a positive. I have no doubt the ingenuity, tenaciousness and \"can do\" attitude of people there, that other strand of the inidualism mentioned earlier, will play an important role in how the world tackles this crisis in the months ahead. On this front, I hope America continues to be the home of the brave."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  What happened when Scots youngsters were let loose in a museum ","story":"BBC Scotland, pm ****IN the movie Night at the Museum, the exhibits, including a T-Rex, came to le after dark. In new BBC Scotland documentary series One Night in the Museum, there were infinitely more terrying prowlers on the loose during closing hours ndash a gaggle of Scottish schoolchildren.The youngsters had travelled from Inverurie to Edinburgh to visit The National Museum of Scotland. The idea was that they could explore on their own, save for an accompanying camera crew, while behind the scenes, museum curators, and viewers at home, would be able to watch the childrenrsquos reactions to the exhibits they encountered.So a little bit Antiques Roadshow, a lot Kids Say the Funniest Things, plus Mark Bonnar, the Sundance Kid to David Tennantrsquos Butch Cassidy in the narrating world, providing the commentary.The first items to bring on a Minions-like ldquoWhoooooah! from the youngsters were the dinosaurs, the big show-offs of the museum world.Talk turned to what the children would doa T-Rex was chasing them. Caley was certain she would run rings round it till it was dizzy.Later, she conceded that she wouldnrsquot really be able to fight an adult or a kid dinosaur ldquobut Irsquod probably be able to fight a baby one. Atta girl.Nicole, , was hoping to see unicorns ldquo they are real. In the meantime she was busy learning that humans were descended from apes. Judging by the monkey impersonation she launched into she was not unduly bothered by the news.At each exhibit the children had a tendency to start reading the information cards then fill in the rest from their imaginations.There was a lot of winging it going on, as when one boy informed the others that a brooch had been made by someone called ldquoAngelo Saxo. The curators had a good old giggle at that.Gazing at some Pictish stones dating from the fth century, one of the junior Indiana Jones thought she recognised something familiar among the symbols. ldquoIs that a bike  Everyone agreed that it certainly was.The nine-strong gang had the sort of energy that made you very grateful you were not running after them.One of the exhibits did bring them skidding to a halt ndash a skeleton in a grave. Nicole was not keen. ldquoI thought it was going to be a unicorn, she said forlornly. The next item they saw was an Iron Maiden, a forerunner to the guillotine. Hope they all slept well in Inverurie that night.The script could have done with an extra polish to get rid of the repetition. One minute we were being toldthat museums were ldquotreasure troves of historical artefacts, only to hear later that a gallery was ldquoa treasure trove of amazing artefacts. A running time of  minutes would have made for a sharper film.Watching from afar, the experts were delighted to see their world through such fresh eyes. One of them had not known there was a button you could press to see an illustrated Iron Maiden in action. She was off to try it right away health and safety regulations.In their own way the experts were still just as enthusiastic about their specialisms as the children.Dr Daniel Potter, curator of ancient Mediterranean, said: ldquoIrsquom a little bit jealous of them to be honest, because when I was a kid I would have wanted nothing more than the opportunity that theyrsquove had to run around a museum and look at everything.The next destinations in the four-part series are Manchesterrsquos Museum of Science and Industry, The National Maritime Museum in London, and The Royal Armouries in Leeds.The best ideas in television are usually the simple ones. This series looks a winner, in large part due to the children, and I can see network interest in the format.Never mind the Hollywood movie and its multi-million dollar special effects. These youngsters, smart as carrots, naturally funny, each a jumping bean of enthusiasm, were better value any day."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/1349700.jpg?type=article-full","title":"hand-god-paul-mccartney-scots-research-uncovers-extent-left-handedness","story":"Add to that stars of popular culture past and present Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Paul McCartney and Jimi Hendrix.Diego Maradona is one and used it to ruin Englands World Cup dreams in the  World Cup.Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay is among the famous Scots in the club.All are left-handers and some experts believe they may have better verbal skills with University of Oxford academics examining a correlation between handedness, language areas of the brain and neuropsychiatric diseases.:Briefing -Left-handednessOthers have hypothesised that a higher percentage of left-handers are to be found among the high achievers in sport - from tennis star Rafael Nadal to cricketer Wasim Akram to baseball pitcher Clayton Kershaw and table tennis star Ding Ning.However the prevelance of people who favour their left over their right has always been a guesstimate until now.And the biggest ever global study of its kind - involving researchers at the University of St Andrews and more than two million iniduals across the world - has established for the first time that one in ten of the worlds populationfavours their left hand over their right.Researchers from across Europe, led by the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and in the UK by the University of St Andrews, examined the responses of ,, iniduals on hand preference for dferent manual tasks.Typically measures of preference are measured by which hand is used to write with. However, for this study researchers allowed for the fact that about % of people use dferent hands for dferent tasks which further improved the accuracy for their findings.The University of St Andrews said that understanding handedness contributes to our understanding of human evolution.For example, it has been claimed that right-handedness, along with the capacity to make and use tools, to use language and to show al and anatomical cerebral specialisation, are characteristics specic to humans, and that they are intimately tied together in the ergent evolution of man from apes.The lead UK author of the study, Dr Silvia Paracchini, of the School of Medicine at St Andrews, said: \"This study will provide a useful reference for dferent areas of handedness research.\"In addition to providing reliable figures, the study highlights iability across studies depending on the dferent criteria used to measure handedness.:Left-handers more inhibited and anxious, new study finds\"While we intuitively classy handedness as a left right category, these data show that the proportion of people using dferent hands for dferent tasks is almost as big as the proportion of the left-handers.\"The reason for people favouring a right hand is often assumed to be because it is controlled by the left hemisphere of the brain, which is also dominant for language in about  per cent of us.Some argue that this ision of neurological labour has been a feature of animals for half a billion years.Some believe it is because it is more efficient to allow the two hemispheres to carry out dferent computations at the same time.The left side of the brain, for instance, might have evolved to carry out routine operations ndash things like foraging for food ndash while the right side was kept free to detect and react rapidly to unexpected challenges in the environment like an approaching predator.This can be seen in ious fish, toads and birds, which are all more likely to attack prey seen in the right eye.But is there any evolutionary advantage to being right or left-handed It appeared, perhaps around , years ago, that there was a clear right-handed preference in prehistoric societies.Wear on the preserved teeth of Homo heidelbergensis, for instance, suggest that food was usually brought to the mouth with the right hand.But according to a  paper in the journal Psychological Bulletin, \"there is remarkably little evidence for any association of left-handedness with deficit, as has often been suggested\".In fact, some research shows that left-handeds might even have an easier time recovering from brain damage. And their left hand seems to have the advantage of surprise in a fight, which means they can be better at combat sports."},{"url":null,"title":"ministers-urged-take-urgent-action-rail-yard-closure","story":"Scottish Labour made the call after it emerged Wabtec is planning to ldquoconsolidate its operations in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, following a reduction in orders.This would result in the closure of its Kilmarnock base ndash originally opened as Andrew Barclay and Sons in  ndash which has helped refurbish recent Abellio ScotRail and ScotRail models.The move would be a further blow to an industry recovering from the closure of the St Rollox ldquoCaley rail depot in Springburn last year, costing  jobs and ending more than  years of history at the site.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard insisted Transport Secretary Michael Matheson must inspect tender documents to ensure Wabtec is not breaching contract conditions.Mr Leonard said the company ldquois currently working on a number of contracts funded by several millions of pounds of public money, including funding from the Scottish Government.In a letter to Mr Matheson, he wrote: ldquoI would appreciateyou might be able to provide an assurance that you will inspect the tender specication and all associated documentation, in particular any conditions placed on the company about the amount of work that has to be done in Scotland, to ensure they are meeting these conditions in full.He added: ldquoThe company has chosen ndash exactly one week after sending a letter to its workers to tell them they were key workers, vital to the connectivity of the Scottish economy ndash to announce plans to make its -strong workforce at the site redundant.ldquoOnly last year the workforce assisted the company to become more competitive by agreeing to a reduction in the overtime rate and the midweek sht allowance.He continued: ldquoI would reiterate that given the importance of this site not only to the local economy but also to the rail infrastructure of Scotland, it is of the utmost importance that the Government and its agencies work with the company to ensure their skills are retained.ldquoIf the company are allowed to close this site, the Government must act with urgency to produce a strategy to retain these jobs.Mr Leonard, who campaigned to save the St Rollox railway works, warned the Wabtec closure could mean some workers will be laid off twice in quick succession.He said: ldquoSNP ministers used the continued operation of Wabtec at Kilmarnock as part of a series of excuses to justy their failure to step in and save the Caley.

This is surely unacceptable.It would surely be possible to ask all businesses to come up with plans to get back to work but meeting the current rules of distancing. It would also be necessary to include rules about travel to work, but I am sure a lot could be done. One size fits all is not good enough. Many local shops employ people who can walk to work and could easily fit locks to doors to allow one or two customers in at a time.

No hugs from my dad because hersquos self-isolating after a bowel cancer operation or mum whorsquos with him. No hugs from my brother because hersquos in the high risk category. No hugs from friends or colleagues because they are stuck in boxes on my phone and no hugs from my son because, well, hersquos a teenager and sadly immune to the joys of a good, meaty hug.So what should be on my wall of positivity  Irsquove leached some thoughts from friends today. One of my favourites is from a flight attendant chum who says as someone who can be in two continents a day, every day, she loves staying in one place ndash having a routine, cooking and eating nutritious food and being present in the moment. Another said: ldquoAw, man, I can reach new levels of laziness and feel absolutely no shame in it whatsoever.One, who is a key worker, said she loves the fact that her daughters ndash who would usually niggle and wind each other up ndash have the house cleaned, tidied and the food on the table when she gets back from work. And another has taken the time away from the daily grind to reconnect with his son and use every day to walk in the wilderness. One slightly nosey mum whipped out the binoculars to spy on her teenage son as he ldquonipped out for a second only to see him placing a Playstation game on the ground, withdraw, and then another teenager furtively walk up and replace his game with one of his. Collective sighs of relief all round.Yesterday brought an impromptu coronavirus moment to my street, which Irsquoll remember for a while: -year-old Sandyrsquos door, festooned with happy birthday balloons and banners, slowly opened as he walked out into the blinding spring sunshine and we all sang to him, young and old, from far flung places and near, accompanied by an accordion and a concertina. As he sipped a fine malt, and we did wee socially distant jigs and clapped him, he blinked at the huge dumpling made for him by one of the neighbours and said: \"Right, whorsquos for a Strip the Willow then \"It was a moment of pure humanity, love and joy. It was the perfect moment for the wall of positivity."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-glasgow-construction-workers-dont-feel-safe","story":"Troubled workers at the pound million Sighthill Transformational Regeneration Area were called back to work yesterday.The Glasgow Times was contacted by several workers who said they were furious contractor Morgan Sindall was forcing them toto work during thecoronaviruscrisis.:Burrell Collection refurb putting lives at riskGlasgow CityCouncilis the main funder of the project and has removed its staff from the site.The Scottish Government said it understood the concerns of staff and expects non-essential business to close.One staff member said: \"This has been highly stressful.

Surely the only thing we all should be concentrating on is following Government guidelines and doing what we can to help, in the hope that none of these planned hospitals, whether in Scotland or the rest of the UK, will need to be used.Ruth Marr, Stirling.The Edinburgh-born physician, after all, was Florence Nightingales medical mentor and collaborator both in the Crimea and subsequently back in Britain.Brian Scott, Lenzie.WE see many Covid- statistics published on a daily basis regarding the relentless march of this grim disease.It is important to see the number of cases and deaths but as important is the number of patients admitted to hospital and then discharged well.In my medical career, like many others, when you have done all you can the last remaining vestige of care is HOPE.As the crisis deepens this statistic may help improve the battered morale of the hard-pressed health care workers and give them hope that this can and will be beaten.Dr AB Stuart, Bridge of Allan.WE should be very grateful to Sweden for taking a dferent, much more restrained approach to dealing with Covid-, regardless of whether its approach turns out to be wise or not. Because of the Swedish governmentrsquos very dferent strategy we will, in a couple of months, be able to answer the question whether the lockdowns in Britain and where were justied.In effect Sweden is providing a control and thus enabling us to take a scientic approach to judging the lockdown. On the one hand no new medication is licensed without undergoing extensive testing involving a control group and double blind testing. On the other hand, our Government has taken economy-crashing action on the basis of a computer model, albeit one created by epidemiologists.The damage to our economy is so extensive that we simply cannot move on without knowing whether the experts advice and the Governmentrsquos actions were appropriate. A comparison with Sweden will allow us to do this.Otto Inglis, Crossgates, Fe.I THINK we would all like to find out who caused the coronavirus. Surely there is a guilty party who could be prosecuted and jailed. The guilty ones are the wildle traffickers who caught the wild animals and sent them to a fresh meat or wet market in Wuhan.

This came as welcome news to Orkney MSP Liam McArthur, who had previously highlighted these concerns. The moves were also welcomed by Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston.The Loganair aircraft will be based at Glasgow Airport but can operate throughout Scotland.   Loganair pilots will be operating the aircraft as usual, and late last week, all received a special briefing from the airline and the Scottish Ambulance Service on the nature of the deployment.Work has continued in Loganair’s Engineering and Flight Operations teams at Glasgow over the weekend and into this week to ensure full readiness of the aircraft ahead of full mission readiness from Friday  April.Loganair is also now working to convert a larger Saab  aircraft, capable of operating into all Highlands and Islands airports apart from Barra, to become an air ambulance with the capability to carry two Epishuttle pods and accompanying medical teams simultaneously.  It is expected this aircraft will be available within the next seven days.Loganair’s Chief Executive Jonathan Hinkles said: “The team effort to make this happen, moving from a concept to an operational solution in just a week, has been absolutely incredible.#Between the SAS and Loganair teams, the concept, testing and training has all taken place and we’re also grateful for the support from the Civil Aviation Authority in progressing this project.“Although the circumstances under which all of this work has been undertaken are ones that we’d never have wished to see, I’m heartened that the effort which has gone into this is truly admirable. We will support the Scottish Ambulance Service, the NHS and the island communities who rely on Loganair for their leline air servicesand when our assistance is needed.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

To achieve this we need to introduce temporary collection measures from Monday .“We need the support of the public to ensure that it is as safe as possible for everyone involved to continue emptying kerbside boxes. “For those householders with kerbside boxes, we are asking that they only put these materials in each box: Option : Paper and Cardboard.Option : Plastics, Food and drinks cans, Foil, Cartons and AerosolsOption : Glass bottle and jars “If you only have  or  boxes please rotate the materials you present each week. For example, the first week put out paper and cardboard in one box and plastics, food and drinks cans, foil, cartons and aerosols in the other box. “The next week put out glass in one box and paper and cardboard in the other box depending on your household requirements. ”If materials are not sorted in this way, then our staff will be forced not to empty your containers until the issue is resolved. “Unfortunately Bryson will not be able to collect batteries, textiles, hand tools or overflow bags when the new collection measures start.“Households with kerbside boxes will receive an information leaflet regarding the new collection arrangements this week. “We appreciate these are dficult and challenging times for everyone.

His move comes after the repeated failure of the Health Department to commit to provide PPE in sufficient quantity to frontline healthcare workers.Over recent weeks, workers in hospitals and care homes as well as other frontline workers in pharmacies and GP practices have been crying out for additional PPE supplies to protect them from contracting the coronavirus. However, despite repeated calls — the most recent being yesterdayby Royal College of Nursing director Pat Cullen in a meeting with the First and deputy First Minister — frontline workers speaking to the Andersonstown News say there is still a widespread shortage of equipment.A full-face visor is a vital —but scarce —defence for NHS workers in face of coronavirusAmong the most valued but hardest-to-get items is the full-face shield now being manufactured by Shnuggle of Newtownards, a company which previously focused on baby products. The firm has orders for , shields and was able to ramp up production after the donation from the Argento boss. Shnuggle is sending packs of  Hero Shields to key workers across the North. The shields are being produced following open source blueprints which means they can be replicated by any other company across the globe without paying a royalty to Shnuggle.On hearing of the new source for the highly-prized face shields, several care homes across Belfast made immediate bids for supplies. One care home alone said it could take  shields immediately.Pete Boyle has taken steps to share the open source manufacturing detail with groups in America where there is a similarly deadly shortage. #We should stop trying to source this equipment from China and start manufacturing it now. Make it, don#t source it. Anyone with a -D printer or an injection mould facility can be up and running immediately# he said. vw, px\"  #Make it, don#t source it.# Pete Boyle#I felt kind of helpless,# added Pete Boyle. #And yet, when I contacted the health service to offer assistance, I was getting mixed messages.

Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Eamon Martin, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland said in anxious and fearful times people turn to God and each other.The leader of the Royal Black Institution also appealed to its members to pray this weekend to protect healthcare professionals, researchers and other key workers during the coronavirus pandemic. “I have appealed to Sir Knights to take time this Sunday at pm to pray for the Lord to bring comfort in these dark days,” said Rev Anderson.“Please do so in your own homes, and we will raise a prayer that will be heard in Heaven itself.”Meanwhile First Minister Arlene Foster confirmed that she discussed the closure of churches with Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown.Mr McKeown had called for churches to be allowed to reopen as places of private prayer during the coronavirus pandemic.He cited the examples of off licenses being allowed to remain open despite the lockdown. Mrs Foster telephoned Bishop McKeown on Wednesday to discuss his concerns.She said she wanted to reach out to him.I didn#t want people to feel constrained from God, the DUP leader said, but that the churches had to close as part of social-distancing to stop the spread of coronavirus.I did want to reach out to Donal, we will be keeping this matter under review because freedom of religion is a very important piece in a democratic society and therefore people should be free to do that.I do join with the church leaders in supporting the call to pray this Sunday, I think that#s an important thing to do and to bring the community together and I hope people will recognise that is a call to bring us all together at this very dficult time. Bishop McKeown told the Irish News he appreciated the conversation.

Since the pandemic was announced and subsequent lockdown measures, many businesses have been forced to close their doors. Other businesses face greater demand than usual and many of them have implemented new safety measures in the workplace to ensure work can go on and needs are met across many sectors. Chief Executive of the Londonderry Chamber, Paul Clancy said: “The response of the business community at this time has been phenomenal. Unfortunately, many businesses which are deemed non-essential have had to close their doors and furlough staff. However, many more face increased pressures and a surge in demand for services. googletag.cmd.push “The demand for food and other essential items such as cleaning items and medicines means that lots of businesses in those supply chains are working even harder to meet the demand. “I have heard from many businesses in recent days who have introduced new social distancing measures to keep things going. That means reducing sht patterns to manage numbers of people at work at any one time, or re-engineering factory floor plans to protect staff. Some we know have even sought out new premises to use in the short term. “The pragmatism of businesses at this time is great to see, not to mention the dedication of workers who continue to show up at work every day. Safety of the workforce has never been more important and we have seen so many examples of responsible employers and their staff working together to manage this. googletag.cmd.push “Lots of them may not see themselves as frontline workers, but they are contributing to the wider national effort that will ensure that shelves are stocked and people do not go without at this very worrying time.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Minister also emphasised that every conceivable effort is being made to improve both situations. “I can assure staff and the wider public that these two issues are receiving absolute priority. It’s no secret that MOT centres and the SSE Arena are among the options being pursued by the HSC system as staff testing sites. “Staff testing numbers are expanding and will continue to do so as rapidly as possible. I fully understand the frustration that we have not been able to scale up testing numbers more quickly. googletag.cmd.push “This is not down to a lack of will or action. There are signicant challenges including laboratory and staffing capacity and the unprecedented levels of global demand for testing reagents and swabs. “I want to make clear that we have been in contact with local company Randox over the past number of days regarding its testing product. We have been informed by Randox that its production line is fully geared towards the NHS as a whole and NI will receive a share of that. “However, we will also continue to explore procuring testing products separately from NHS wide arrangements. We do not want to be dependent on one source for these products.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Swann stressed:“I am confident we will make signicant progress on staff testing in the days ahead. But I want to be totally frank about the pressures that exist. If there were quick fixes available, I would certainly have used them.” Turning to PPE, the Minister said:“Our health service has signicant levels of PPE in stock at present but need to boost these quantities given the expected level of demand in coming weeks. Our PPE supplies have been supported through release of % of the emergency pandemic stockpile as announced last week – in the region of  million items. “Updated UK-wide NHS guidance on PPE use has been issued. This guidance will inform PPE use across our system and help us to prioritise distribution. “I fully understand that staff on the frontline need reassurance. I believe the updated guidance and securing greater quantities of PPE for Northern Ireland will both play a part in allaying concerns. “I want to make absolutely clear that the PPE guidance is about ensuring staff have the appropriate level of protection for the circumstances they are working in – it is absolutely not, nor will it ever be, about seeking to restrict the use of equipment.” He continued:“The situation with PPE supply has been made more challenging by the fact that supply routes from China, a leading global provider, were closed until recently. “I am actively working with the Finance Minister to pursue all feasible supply routes, both international and local. “I recognise that other NI Departments are also facing PPE challenges. We have to tackle this together across the Executive and also to appreciate the scale of global competition for PPE products. The Minister added:“It would be facile for anyone to suggest that there has been any lack of urgency. We are doing everything we can to best of our ability to make things better. “Our health service has been under consider financial pressure for the past  years. That has inevitably had a bearing on its capacity. I cannot undo that, but I will work night and day for the sake of the public and our great health and social care staff. Colleagues right across the system at all levels are doing the same.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There certainly should be a coordinated approach North and South but there are actions Stormont Executive parties and the Dail have not been willing to act on when it comes to PPE, Covid- test kits and ventilators. They havent been willing to put public health ahead of private companies raking in massive profits in the midst of this crisis. This is why their response has been slow, inadequate and putting lives at risk. googletag.cmd.push When the WHO declared Covid- a global pandemic on January  manufacturers should have been directed by Westminster, Stormont and the Dail to repurpose production to mass produce PPE. This didnt happen and now were scrambling to get them from China. It can still happen. For testing of Covid- and mass testing, Randox Laboratories in Crumlin, Antrim, should be put under public control. Randox has received tens of millions in public money but have be allowed to go on a profiteering binge. Instead of being directed to mass produce testing kits as part of an integrated all-Ireland health strategy theyve been able to charge exorbitant prices. Prince Charles, Boris Johnson and elites get tested while workers and the sick dont. Put Randox under public control now. googletag.cmd.push Randox pays Tory MP Owen Patterson pound, a year and have been allowed to put profits for shareholders ahead of people and profit. The rich and powerful shouldnt have access to testing when frontline workers cant. Thirdly, Medtronic based in Galway, is a global manufacturer of le-saving ventilators. Medtronic should also be put under public control to produce thousands of ventilators for health services North and South. Business cant go on as usual in response to this crisis. Private companies cant be allowed to put profiteering ahead of people and health. These are actions that should be taken but the political establishment, so long subservient to powerful corporations, wont contemplate them unless they come under pressure to do so.

It read: “During the disturbances of  it enjoyed comparative tranquillity.” Anyone living in the County Derry town at the time of the ill-fated United Irishmen rebellion would no doubt disagree. The ins and outs of the  rebellion were played out at a local level across the country, something local historian Joseph McCoy thinks is not mentioned enough in schools. He says: “I understand the necessity to look at the First and Second World Wars, but they have so little about the place we’re living in, particularly the local stuff. googletag.cmd.push “The story of  in Maghera is complex. There’s a whole plethora of dferent writers on the subject but no two stories are the same. That tells me that they are pulling a lot from folklore.” Troops had been stationed in the town before the rising began in June  and the rebellious plans were being drawn up around them. An account of how recoat army captain Francis Lamont met and married the daughter of hotel proprietor Jack O’Neill bears testament to this. Captain Lamont, second in command to Colonel Leith, had been passing what is now known as Walsh’s, when he found himself transfixed by a young girl working in the hotel. googletag.cmd.push When she ed his glance, the captain turned to his superior and told him in no uncertain terms thatshe were not yet married, she would be his we. The pair were married in May  and Lamont was named on a list of people who donated to the building of Glen chapel, where the couple rest in the graveyard. It was certainly not the last time love flourished with a meeting of eyes in Walsh’s Hotel.  History and folklore have weaved a rich tapestry of tragedy, violence, compassion and love at the foot of the Glenshane in . The town was so involved in the skirmishes that after the uprising failed, Colonel Leith’s redcoat army may have planned to reduce it to rubble in retribution. In an article for the Maghera Times, a local historical paper, Joseph McCoy wrote: “Initial suggestions tell us that the army was prepared to blow the town to pieces with a detachment of cannon, which had been placed on top of a hill overlooking the town.” However, Maghera was spared, and the people lived to pass on the tales of the rebellion’s leaders in the town, many of whom suffered reprisals in its aftermath. Rev. John Glendy  Rev. Glendy provided leadership to the volunteers in the years leading up to , which led to James Spottswood of the Salters Company in Magherafelt admonishing him in print in . He wrote: “Glendy of Maghera is tainted with the blackest principles of revolution. His many sermons are but discourses containing treason. “We have seen him on erse occasion with the Popish priest of Magherafelt in that union of the Romish Church with whom he does conspire against this Realm.” Glendy composed the oath sworn by all members of the United Irishmen, and at some meetings, stood behind a pulpit bearing the legend ‘vive la Republique’, in a nod to the French revolution. As expected, the hunt for Glendy in the aftermath of the rebellion was an earnest one. He fled to a place called the Grove where he stayed with a man named Wilson for a fortnight. One popular account of how Glendy evaded capture was by borrowing a petticoat, cloak, bonnet and stockings from a woman named Sarah MacQuirken and escaping dressed as a woman. His escape was almost foiled when a local magistrate called Forrester recognised him, but his Presbyterian colleague, Clark, restrained him from making an arrest. The unusual attire also helped him evade a passing redcoat patrol in Tobermore, but his fate was sealed when troops surrounded a friend’s house and he was forced to hand himself in. Glendy was imprisoned on a barge moored in Belfast Lough before being exiled in America, where he became chaplain to the US House of Representatives in  and the Senate in . He passed away in Philadelphia in October  and is buried in Baltimore. Walter ‘Watty’ Graham  Synonymous with the GAA tradition in Glen, the name Watty Graham is familiar in Maghera and its surrounds. Graham was an Elder in the local Presbyterian church and had been central to organising the rebellion’s activity in Maghera. After it was quelled, his house was set on fire in reprisal and after a bounty of pound was placed on his head, he set off for Magilligan, from where he intended to travel to Moville. En route, he stopped at the Rectory of Tamlaght, where he intended to collect pound that the occupier, Mr Church owed him. Mr Church said he would have to go to Maghera to get the money but, in truth, intended to turn him into the authorities in a bid to clear his debt and collect a handsome reward. A servant girl overheard Church telling his we of the plan, and he swore her to secrecy, but the girl found a way to warn Watty Graham of the betrayal. In his book ‘Famous Maghera Men, Eoin Walsh writes how the girl warned Graham using the phrase ‘A herring was never taken on bait’. Graham attempted to evade capture by grabbing a shovel from a nearby workman and telling him to run instead. The soldiers followed the workman, but the Rector spotted the ruse and alerted the soldiers to Graham’s presence. He was swtly arrested. Watty Graham was executed, decapitated and his head carried through the town of Maghera in an intimidatory warning to local supporters of the United Irishmen. His relatives are thought to have retrieved his remains and buried them. Mr Chuch did not live long to enjoy the fruits of his betrayal and was bludgeoned to death at the entrance to his avenue while attending a call to tend to a dying parishioner. William ‘Billy’ Cuddy  In the swirling air of mistrust that prevailed after the rebellion, suspicion was easily aroused, and it cost the le of an innocent man in Billy Cuddy. “An unseasonable jest cost him his le,” wrote Joseph McCoy in his Maghera Times article. Cuddy, a wheelwright and blue dyer by trade, had been employed to insert a pane of glass into a leaden window-frame and remarked that it would not be dficult to turn the lead into bullets. The owner of the house reported him to local clerical magistrate called Clotsworthy Soden, who had him arrested and sentenced to death. “Billy Cuddy had a fairly good relationship with the townsfolk, even the soldiers,” says Joseph. “Colonel Leith, commander of the royalist forces in Maghera, understood that Clotsworthy Soden was maybe overstretching his authority, but it was authority he had. “As they were taking him to his death, he recited the nd psalm at the top of his voice referring to the Rector being to blame for his downfall.” Colonel Leith asked Cuddy on the gallowshe wanted to leave the case in his hands. Many watching on considered it to be an act of mercy, but Cuddy tragically misunderstood the offer. He declared he would ‘leave it to a Higher Power’. Leith deemed that this was a rejection of his offer and William Cuddy was hanged. No further indignity was inflicted on his body though, and local tradition has it that he was cut down from the rope while still alive, nursed back to health and spirited away to America. A mock funeral is said to have been held in Maghera, and a weathered stone in the old St Lurach’s church bears the inscription ‘The Burying Place of William Cuddy’. The names of Glendy, Graham and Cuddy will not catch the eye of many modern-day history students, but they are ingrained in the town of Maghera and its rich history from this period. Their heroic and tragic stories will continue to be passed from generation to generation and the tangible history of Maghera’s United Irishmen will endure.

It read: “During the disturbances of  it enjoyed comparative tranquillity.” Anyone living in the County Derry town at the time of the ill-fated United Irishmen rebellion would no doubt disagree. The ins and outs of the  rebellion were played out at a local level across the country, something local historian Joseph McCoy thinks is not mentioned enough in schools. He says: “I understand the necessity to look at the First and Second World Wars, but they have so little about the place we’re living in, particularly the local stuff. googletag.cmd.push “The story of  in Maghera is complex. There’s a whole plethora of dferent writers on the subject but no two stories are the same. That tells me that they are pulling a lot from folklore.” Troops had been stationed in the town before the rising began in June  and the rebellious plans were being drawn up around them. An account of how recoat army captain Francis Lamont met and married the daughter of hotel proprietor Jack O’Neill bears testament to this. Captain Lamont, second in command to Colonel Leith, had been passing what is now known as Walsh’s, when he found himself transfixed by a young girl working in the hotel. googletag.cmd.push When she ed his glance, the captain turned to his superior and told him in no uncertain terms thatshe were not yet married, she would be his we. The pair were married in May  and Lamont was named on a list of people who donated to the building of Glen chapel, where the couple rest in the graveyard. It was certainly not the last time love flourished with a meeting of eyes in Walsh’s Hotel.  History and folklore have weaved a rich tapestry of tragedy, violence, compassion and love at the foot of the Glenshane in . The town was so involved in the skirmishes that after the uprising failed, Colonel Leith’s redcoat army may have planned to reduce it to rubble in retribution. In an article for the Maghera Times, a local historical paper, Joseph McCoy wrote: “Initial suggestions tell us that the army was prepared to blow the town to pieces with a detachment of cannon, which had been placed on top of a hill overlooking the town.” However, Maghera was spared, and the people lived to pass on the tales of the rebellion’s leaders in the town, many of whom suffered reprisals in its aftermath. Rev. John Glendy  Rev. Glendy provided leadership to the volunteers in the years leading up to , which led to James Spottswood of the Salters Company in Magherafelt admonishing him in print in . He wrote: “Glendy of Maghera is tainted with the blackest principles of revolution. His many sermons are but discourses containing treason. “We have seen him on erse occasion with the Popish priest of Magherafelt in that union of the Romish Church with whom he does conspire against this Realm.” Glendy composed the oath sworn by all members of the United Irishmen, and at some meetings, stood behind a pulpit bearing the legend ‘vive la Republique’, in a nod to the French revolution. As expected, the hunt for Glendy in the aftermath of the rebellion was an earnest one. He fled to a place called the Grove where he stayed with a man named Wilson for a fortnight. One popular account of how Glendy evaded capture was by borrowing a petticoat, cloak, bonnet and stockings from a woman named Sarah MacQuirken and escaping dressed as a woman. His escape was almost foiled when a local magistrate called Forrester recognised him, but his Presbyterian colleague, Clark, restrained him from making an arrest. The unusual attire also helped him evade a passing redcoat patrol in Tobermore, but his fate was sealed when troops surrounded a friend’s house and he was forced to hand himself in. Glendy was imprisoned on a barge moored in Belfast Lough before being exiled in America, where he became chaplain to the US House of Representatives in  and the Senate in . He passed away in Philadelphia in October  and is buried in Baltimore. Walter ‘Watty’ Graham  Synonymous with the GAA tradition in Glen, the name Watty Graham is familiar in Maghera and its surrounds. Graham was an Elder in the local Presbyterian church and had been central to organising the rebellion’s activity in Maghera. After it was quelled, his house was set on fire in reprisal and after a bounty of pound was placed on his head, he set off for Magilligan, from where he intended to travel to Moville. En route, he stopped at the Rectory of Tamlaght, where he intended to collect pound that the occupier, Mr Church owed him. Mr Church said he would have to go to Maghera to get the money but, in truth, intended to turn him into the authorities in a bid to clear his debt and collect a handsome reward. A servant girl overheard Church telling his we of the plan, and he swore her to secrecy, but the girl found a way to warn Watty Graham of the betrayal. In his book ‘Famous Maghera Men, Eoin Walsh writes how the girl warned Graham using the phrase ‘A herring was never taken on bait’. Graham attempted to evade capture by grabbing a shovel from a nearby workman and telling him to run instead. The soldiers followed the workman, but the Rector spotted the ruse and alerted the soldiers to Graham’s presence. He was swtly arrested. Watty Graham was executed, decapitated and his head carried through the town of Maghera in an intimidatory warning to local supporters of the United Irishmen. His relatives are thought to have retrieved his remains and buried them. Mr Chuch did not live long to enjoy the fruits of his betrayal and was bludgeoned to death at the entrance to his avenue while attending a call to tend to a dying parishioner. William ‘Billy’ Cuddy  In the swirling air of mistrust that prevailed after the rebellion, suspicion was easily aroused, and it cost the le of an innocent man in Billy Cuddy. “An unseasonable jest cost him his le,” wrote Joseph McCoy in his Maghera Times article. Cuddy, a wheelwright and blue dyer by trade, had been employed to insert a pane of glass into a leaden window-frame and remarked that it would not be dficult to turn the lead into bullets. The owner of the house reported him to local clerical magistrate called Clotsworthy Soden, who had him arrested and sentenced to death. “Billy Cuddy had a fairly good relationship with the townsfolk, even the soldiers,” says Joseph. “Colonel Leith, commander of the royalist forces in Maghera, understood that Clotsworthy Soden was maybe overstretching his authority, but it was authority he had. “As they were taking him to his death, he recited the nd psalm at the top of his voice referring to the Rector being to blame for his downfall.” Colonel Leith asked Cuddy on the gallowshe wanted to leave the case in his hands. Many watching on considered it to be an act of mercy, but Cuddy tragically misunderstood the offer. He declared he would ‘leave it to a Higher Power’. Leith deemed that this was a rejection of his offer and William Cuddy was hanged. No further indignity was inflicted on his body though, and local tradition has it that he was cut down from the rope while still alive, nursed back to health and spirited away to America. A mock funeral is said to have been held in Maghera, and a weathered stone in the old St Lurach’s church bears the inscription ‘The Burying Place of William Cuddy’. The names of Glendy, Graham and Cuddy will not catch the eye of many modern-day history students, but they are ingrained in the town of Maghera and its rich history from this period. Their heroic and tragic stories will continue to be passed from generation to generation and the tangible history of Maghera’s United Irishmen will endure.

Paul Kerrigan was fouled by Fergal Doherty after three minutes and John Hayes sent Barry Gillis the wrong way from the resulting penalty. Less than  seconds later Fintan Gould blasted to the top corner with his magnicent finish from a tight angle. It would have been easy for Derry to conform to recent expectations and throw in the towel after what was a horrendous start to the game. When Daniel Goulding added a sixth minute free, the small crowd of Derry fans would have feared the worst. - to - behind and coming off the back of four straight defeats, there wasn’t much optimism flying about. googletag.cmd.push The reaction deserves credit. The performance was a massive improvement on that shown against Monaghan and Mayo in the two weeks previous. Paddy Bradley spearheaded the revival, kicking three of Derry’s seven unanswered point that turned a six point deficit into a one-point lead. It was a spell of pretty ruthless football from the Oakleafers, although had Mark Lynch had another half second to get the ball to his foot, his close range effort might not have been smothered by Paddy O’Shea. Still, with seven minutes to go to the half, Damian Cassidy’s side led by a point and were capitalising on a lot of Cork errors. googletag.cmd.push Without Patsy Bradley, Derry lost the kick-out battle and soon Cork were back in the game again. Cork led by threeat the interval, and maintained a similar degree of comfort until the latter stages. But when Raymond Wilkinson and Paddy Bradley pointed to leave Derry just a point behind going into injury time, they just needed a little bit of composure. Charlie Kielt and Mark Lynch kicked a wide each before Paul Kerrigan just booted the ball over the line to allow Marty Duffy to call time and see the Munstermen home with a rare two points from Ulster.

They responded superbly!  First up, the poets of Crossroads Primary School, Kilrea have been working hard.

But maybe this was God’s plan Saving the environment by changing man Working together by staying apart googletag.cmd.push The air is clearer, well, that’s a start.  I’m sure everything will be ok It will go back to normal another day The isolation is not forever We just have to remember, we’re in this together.

Wash your hands, sing Happy Birthday in your head.  It’s horrid, it’s bad, it’s terrible too. No more school, no more sports. If you go out you could go to court. Stay away, it’s awful indeed.  Everyone’s sad, we want it to go. It’s crushing our dreams, sadly not slow. We’re bored, we’re sad, there’s nowhere to go We can’t go swimming or to the movies.  People are sick, people are scared. Please help us God, we’ll all say our prayers. It’s a huge impact on our modern le. Just stay indoors or you are risking a le. By Aine McGill, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea   The Invisible Danger Coronavirus go away! Its disrupting our lives everyday, The NHS are busy, people are getting sick. You’re an invisible danger.  Worse than war  We`re scared, we`re sad. We`re bored and lonely.  Missing school and all my friends, Home school with mum and dad at the kitchen table, No trips out not even to the shop, Every day is the same.  Routine has disappeared like snow in the sun But there’s a rainbow in our window All`s not gone, there’s still hope Its not forever but it feels like it right now! Clodagh Bradley, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea   The Coronavirus Coronavirus, what a funny name All I know is it ruins all our fun and games We can’t go to school in case we get infected Scientists are trying to get medicine to get us injected I miss the park, having sleepovers and playing in the dark Make sure you wash your hands If you don’t it could catch you too. Emily Brizzell, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea  Year  pupils at Limavady High School also gave us their take on the current crisis...  It is strange working from home during lock down, because I don’t have to change classrooms every  minutes and I get to work in my dad’s office out the back of his house. I also get to spend more time with my family, my mum, dad, two sisters and two brothers. Every day I do Home Economics by helping to make dinner and I do Technology out in my dad’s workshop. I miss getting to see other people, my family and my friends, but I can still phone them at any time. I don’t have any homework in the evenings now because I have done it during the day. In the morning I write out my timetable for that day ahead and do PE on YouTube at :am. I miss going out for walks throughout the day, but I find other things to do. By Rebecca Hockley. I    Lockdown over the last week has definitely been one interesting experience. It’s one experience I hope we never have to repeat. One of the positive things about this is I get to watch a lot more TV as well as doing schoolwork during the day. The main thing I miss about school is not being able to see any of my friends until September again. I am still trying to get used to not having to get up at .am every morning and having my lunch at dferent times and especially not having to get a bus. I am also going to miss some of the teachers in our school as well. With a really strange week nearly up, I have to admit the schoolwork isn’t as bad as I thought it was first going to be. Jack Bredin F      When I heard we were going in lockdown I didn’t know what to expect. My first thought was you could not go out of the house except shopping for food. My mum and dad explained to me what lockdown meant. They explained that I could still go outside, but only for one form of exercise. So I choose to run. I feel sad that I am not going to have face to face contact with my friends but I’m lucky to have Wi and I talk to my friends daily. The positive side of lockdown is I get to spend more time with my two brothers and my sister. They are company and together we try to support each other with our home schooling. Lockdown is giving me a chance to help my mum and dad about the house and learn new skills like cooking, cleaning and building. My mum jokes this will make my future we happy! Alex Donnell F   Le under lockdown is very boring because I cannot see my friends or some of my family members. It is also not great because I cant go to school either and see my friends and teachers, but I can get out for some fresh air and I can get lots of things done around the house that I cant get done when I was at school. I do miss the fun at school and getting to see my friends but hopefully sometime soon we will come out of lockdown. Remember to wash your hands and stay at a social distance from each other when you are outside. Alex McMichael F   Social Distancing Le in the fast lane has had to stop We are only allowed out to exercise or shop Wash your hands is the golden rule Never thought Id say that Id miss school My brother’s crying because hes fed up My sisters cracking up with her laptop Everyone is trying to be kind Always keeping the vulnerable in mind Essential staff have had to work Home schooling is driving parents berserk I miss my Grandparents theyre the best At least I am giving their heads a rest It’s now we realise what is important to us No point huffing or puffing or causing a fuss My family is so important to me Just think in a few weeks we can be free For everyone out there please take care This virus could be lurking anywhere Corona Virus is a mystery But please remember we are making History! Jay Scott I   Le under lock down can be very boring but fun at the same time. I don`thave to wake up as early and get to sleep in a bit longer. Idon`t have to move around every half an hour to get to my next class. I can take my time in doing my work and don`t have to rush through everything. Sometimes it can get really annoying, how the time passes really slowly or being stuck in the house in general. Some days I do wish I could go back to school because the time flies by a lot quicker and the day does not feel as long. I have a lot more family time and get to spend more quality time with my sister. I also get to annoy my parents which I do anyway! Amelia Sinclair A   It is a very strange feeling not being able to leave the house, it’s like being imprisoned! I miss playing with my friends and being in school learning alongside them. I am spending more time in my bedroom at my desk working on schoolwork which can feel boring and hard work as I can find learning a challenge! However, being away from school makes me appreciate the help and support I get in school from my teachers. On a positive note, being in lock down I don’t have to wake up as early to catch the bus. My schooling at home is more flexible and I can take a break when I want to. I have been using technology to communicate with my friends. We all arranged a video call together and it was great to see them and have a chat. Having to stay at home with only my family for company means we are spending more time together, eating together, playing together and enjoying our family PE lessons daily with Joe Wicks! We have a laugh together as we exercise. I am trying to stay positive and as a family we are trying to think of fun activities to do together like, going on a bike ride in the countryside, going on walks, do some baking, watching movies and at Easter time we are going to have Easter egg hunt in the garden. Stay positive everyone and keep safe. Isaac Morrison Year    Finally, we have the Taylor family from Limavady, who gave us an account of how children in the same house, but of dferent ages, are reading the situation.  Covid- My name is Harry and I’m a schoolboy during the coronavirus Covid- pandemic. I have to be home-schooled right now because the virus is running rampage. Personally, I think my mummy is a really good teacher. We have to use social distancing to stay safe in shops or pharmacies. This coronavirus outbreak is NOT scary in my eyes. I just think of it as a really bad cold that’s killing the elderly, so it should be called ‘The Elderly Killer’. It was just Monday night when lockdown was put into action in the UK. Also, being home-schooled has its pros and cons. Pros: getting to wear what you want activities every afternoon, sibling humour, your own back garden. Cons: full school day, digital PE. Harry Taylor, , Limavady  My Le Right Now Hello, my name is Molly and I am  years old. Right now there is an illness called coronavirus, also called Covid-. I am being home-schooled. I really hate having no friends in home-school, and no line points. I love still having a textbook, activities, doing PE and having Star of the Week. On Friday, Mummy had to pick up the packs from my school and Daddy works hard and late. Mammy teaches us and soon she might have to go in and look after key workers’ children. She said she might have to bring me and my brother and sister. Molly Taylor, , Limavady   Everything’s Not Normal Hi, my name is Emily and I am  years old. I am being home-schooled right now because of coronavirus Covid-. My mummy is a really good teacher, she makes really fun days for us. My teacher sent me home instructions to make a rain maker. I learnt about how the sun warms up the earth and the water goes up to the sky to make clouds. I am learning to do story writing. I did PE with Joe Wicks on YouTube and we made buns. I miss my swimming. I wrote letters to my friends because I miss them too. I can’t wait until it’s back to normal. Emily Taylor, , Limavady  If your child is working on something - wed love to hear from you.

It was all cancelled, all shut down, My pumps, my dress, my dancing crown, No more classes, no more teams, This had let me down, ruined my dreams. googletag.cmd.push  We had the money ready, booked a hotel, Id love to hear the judge ring the bell, Ive always had an image of me at Killarney in my mind, Hopefully Worlds  will happen another time! CORONAVIRUS YOU ARE TO BLAME!!!!!!!! Molly McGoldrick ,, Crossroads PS, Kilrea  God’s Great Plan One day we’re in P and everything’s ok But then everything changes the very next day School as we knew it would never be the same Coronavirus outbreak is such a shame.  But maybe this was God’s plan Saving the environment by changing man Working together by staying apart googletag.cmd.push The air is clearer, well, that’s a start.

Wash your hands, sing Happy Birthday in your head.  It’s horrid, it’s bad, it’s terrible too. No more school, no more sports. If you go out you could go to court. Stay away, it’s awful indeed.  Everyone’s sad, we want it to go. It’s crushing our dreams, sadly not slow. We’re bored, we’re sad, there’s nowhere to go We can’t go swimming or to the movies.  People are sick, people are scared. Please help us God, we’ll all say our prayers. It’s a huge impact on our modern le. Just stay indoors or you are risking a le. By Aine McGill, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea   The Invisible Danger Coronavirus go away! Its disrupting our lives everyday, The NHS are busy, people are getting sick. You’re an invisible danger.  Worse than war  We`re scared, we`re sad. We`re bored and lonely.  Missing school and all my friends, Home school with mum and dad at the kitchen table, No trips out not even to the shop, Every day is the same.  Routine has disappeared like snow in the sun But there’s a rainbow in our window All`s not gone, there’s still hope Its not forever but it feels like it right now! Clodagh Bradley, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea   The Coronavirus Coronavirus, what a funny name All I know is it ruins all our fun and games We can’t go to school in case we get infected Scientists are trying to get medicine to get us injected I miss the park, having sleepovers and playing in the dark Make sure you wash your hands If you don’t it could catch you too. Emily Brizzell, , Crossroads PS, Kilrea  Year  pupils at Limavady High School also gave us their take on the current crisis...  It is strange working from home during lock down, because I don’t have to change classrooms every  minutes and I get to work in my dad’s office out the back of his house. I also get to spend more time with my family, my mum, dad, two sisters and two brothers. Every day I do Home Economics by helping to make dinner and I do Technology out in my dad’s workshop. I miss getting to see other people, my family and my friends, but I can still phone them at any time. I don’t have any homework in the evenings now because I have done it during the day. In the morning I write out my timetable for that day ahead and do PE on YouTube at :am. I miss going out for walks throughout the day, but I find other things to do. By Rebecca Hockley. I    Lockdown over the last week has definitely been one interesting experience. It’s one experience I hope we never have to repeat. One of the positive things about this is I get to watch a lot more TV as well as doing schoolwork during the day. The main thing I miss about school is not being able to see any of my friends until September again. I am still trying to get used to not having to get up at .am every morning and having my lunch at dferent times and especially not having to get a bus. I am also going to miss some of the teachers in our school as well. With a really strange week nearly up, I have to admit the schoolwork isn’t as bad as I thought it was first going to be. Jack Bredin F      When I heard we were going in lockdown I didn’t know what to expect. My first thought was you could not go out of the house except shopping for food. My mum and dad explained to me what lockdown meant. They explained that I could still go outside, but only for one form of exercise. So I choose to run. I feel sad that I am not going to have face to face contact with my friends but I’m lucky to have Wi and I talk to my friends daily. The positive side of lockdown is I get to spend more time with my two brothers and my sister. They are company and together we try to support each other with our home schooling. Lockdown is giving me a chance to help my mum and dad about the house and learn new skills like cooking, cleaning and building. My mum jokes this will make my future we happy! Alex Donnell F   Le under lockdown is very boring because I cannot see my friends or some of my family members. It is also not great because I cant go to school either and see my friends and teachers, but I can get out for some fresh air and I can get lots of things done around the house that I cant get done when I was at school. I do miss the fun at school and getting to see my friends but hopefully sometime soon we will come out of lockdown. Remember to wash your hands and stay at a social distance from each other when you are outside. Alex McMichael F   Social Distancing Le in the fast lane has had to stop We are only allowed out to exercise or shop Wash your hands is the golden rule Never thought Id say that Id miss school My brother’s crying because hes fed up My sisters cracking up with her laptop Everyone is trying to be kind Always keeping the vulnerable in mind Essential staff have had to work Home schooling is driving parents berserk I miss my Grandparents theyre the best At least I am giving their heads a rest It’s now we realise what is important to us No point huffing or puffing or causing a fuss My family is so important to me Just think in a few weeks we can be free For everyone out there please take care This virus could be lurking anywhere Corona Virus is a mystery But please remember we are making History! Jay Scott I   Le under lock down can be very boring but fun at the same time. I don`thave to wake up as early and get to sleep in a bit longer. Idon`t have to move around every half an hour to get to my next class. I can take my time in doing my work and don`t have to rush through everything. Sometimes it can get really annoying, how the time passes really slowly or being stuck in the house in general. Some days I do wish I could go back to school because the time flies by a lot quicker and the day does not feel as long. I have a lot more family time and get to spend more quality time with my sister. I also get to annoy my parents which I do anyway! Amelia Sinclair A   It is a very strange feeling not being able to leave the house, it’s like being imprisoned! I miss playing with my friends and being in school learning alongside them. I am spending more time in my bedroom at my desk working on schoolwork which can feel boring and hard work as I can find learning a challenge! However, being away from school makes me appreciate the help and support I get in school from my teachers. On a positive note, being in lock down I don’t have to wake up as early to catch the bus. My schooling at home is more flexible and I can take a break when I want to. I have been using technology to communicate with my friends. We all arranged a video call together and it was great to see them and have a chat. Having to stay at home with only my family for company means we are spending more time together, eating together, playing together and enjoying our family PE lessons daily with Joe Wicks! We have a laugh together as we exercise. I am trying to stay positive and as a family we are trying to think of fun activities to do together like, going on a bike ride in the countryside, going on walks, do some baking, watching movies and at Easter time we are going to have Easter egg hunt in the garden. Stay positive everyone and keep safe. Isaac Morrison Year    Finally, we have the Taylor family from Limavady, who gave us an account of how children in the same house, but of dferent ages, are reading the situation.  Covid- My name is Harry and I’m a schoolboy during the coronavirus Covid- pandemic. I have to be home-schooled right now because the virus is running rampage. Personally, I think my mummy is a really good teacher. We have to use social distancing to stay safe in shops or pharmacies. This coronavirus outbreak is NOT scary in my eyes. I just think of it as a really bad cold that’s killing the elderly, so it should be called ‘The Elderly Killer’. It was just Monday night when lockdown was put into action in the UK. Also, being home-schooled has its pros and cons. Pros: getting to wear what you want activities every afternoon, sibling humour, your own back garden. Cons: full school day, digital PE. Harry Taylor, , Limavady  My Le Right Now Hello, my name is Molly and I am  years old. Right now there is an illness called coronavirus, also called Covid-. I am being home-schooled. I really hate having no friends in home-school, and no line points. I love still having a textbook, activities, doing PE and having Star of the Week. On Friday, Mummy had to pick up the packs from my school and Daddy works hard and late. Mammy teaches us and soon she might have to go in and look after key workers’ children. She said she might have to bring me and my brother and sister. Molly Taylor, , Limavady   Everything’s Not Normal Hi, my name is Emily and I am  years old. I am being home-schooled right now because of coronavirus Covid-. My mummy is a really good teacher, she makes really fun days for us. My teacher sent me home instructions to make a rain maker. I learnt about how the sun warms up the earth and the water goes up to the sky to make clouds. I am learning to do story writing. I did PE with Joe Wicks on YouTube and we made buns. I miss my swimming. I wrote letters to my friends because I miss them too. I can’t wait until it’s back to normal. Emily Taylor, , Limavady  If your child is working on something - wed love to hear from you.

The health trust is also enhancing care at home packages for the vulnerable and elderly in the community.Mr Hazzard said the local community will be understandably concerned about the ldquodramatic changes to the hospital and that some may even be angry.ldquoDuring this global health emergency, we must put our faith and support in the expert health practitioners who are best placed to take these decisions, he continued.ldquoI welcome the public commitment from the South Eastern Trust that these are strictly temporary measures to meet the unprecedented challenges represented by the coronavirus pandemic and will not become a permanent reality.Mr Hazzard said that in the days ahead, many queries and issues will arise from the health trustrsquos decision, both from the public and those who work in the health and social care system.He declared: ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to engage with the health trust and other agencies to ensure there is public confidence in this radical approach.ldquoWith this in mind we have written to the Ambulance Service to ask that they urgently reassess their capacity to meet the subsequent needs of our local community on the back of this announcement.Mr Hazzard also appealed to the community to do all in its power to help and assist health and social care workers who find themselves at the frontline in the battle against COVID-.He added: ldquoThey are doing an incredible job in the most challenging of circumstances to keep us all safe. We must demonstrate real social solidarity in order to help and support them in the unprecedented crisis ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 A\u0026E.jpg","title":"A%26E shut in Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department has been temporarily closed as part of sweeping changes implemented by health chiefs preparing for the expected surge in coronavirus cases.The department closed on Monday morning with critical care staff and some equipment relocated to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as part of a radical overhaul of services to cope with the global pandemic.The day procedure unit, outpatients department and minor injuries service at the Downpatrick hospital have also been closed, but the critically important GP out-of-hours service remains operational.Inpatient wards and acute mental heath and psychiatry services for the elderly remain open, as does the hospitalrsquos midwery-led unit, but no births are being allowed to take place for the time being.The South Eastern Trust said that as the organisation prepares ldquofor the biggest challenge it has ever faced it needs to reshape its hospitals and other services on a temporary basis to maximise its ability to ldquomanage the surge in demand for services due to COVID-.While local politicians have reluctantly accepted the closure of several key services at the Downe as part of a reconfiguration plan, they say public and private assurances from senior health trust officials that the changes are temporary must be honoured and all services fully restored when the crisis is over.News of the closure of the Downersquos emergency department and other services came ahead of confirmation that the Downpatrick hospital is one of  locations across the Province which has been designated as a primary care COVID- assessment centre which is expected to open before the end of the week.The new centre mdash designed to help manage the expected increase in coronavirus cases in the community mdash will allow patients who are showing symptoms of the virus to be separated from those with non COVID- conditions.Health chiefs insist that the new service is ldquoessential to ensure that vital GP services can be maintained over the coming weeks and months with minimum disruption.The new centre is not a testing facility and is only there for patients who are unwell and suspected of having the virus and require medical attention.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until .

This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

Despite repeated promises that supplies are due from China, we have yet to hear how much was ordered, when it is due for arrival and how it will be managed,” he said.“We now need a clear statement from the finance minister.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

parts of the country has rocketed.ldquoCouncil libraries provide a vital service for residents and act as community hubs in normal times.ldquoTheir online digital contribution has now become equally

Its no secret that MOT centres and the SSE Arena are among the options being pursued by the HSC system as staff testing sites.Staff testing numbers are expanding and will continue to do so as rapidly as possible. I fully understand the frustration that we have not been able to scale up testing numbers more quickly.This is not down to a lack of will or action. There are signicant challenges including laboratory and staffing capacity and the unprecedented levels of global demand for testing reagents and swabs.I want to make clear that we have been in contact with local company Randox over the past number of days regarding its testing product. We have been informed by Randox that its production line is fully geared towards the NHS as a whole and NI will receive a share of that.However, we will also continue to explore procuring testing products separately from NHS wide arrangements. We do not want to be dependent on one source for these products.Mr Swann stressed: I am confident we will make signicant progress on staff testing in the days ahead. But I want to be totally frank about the pressures that exist. If there were quick fixes available, I would certainly have used them.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_aacbcabccccfcc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_aefeccedceacc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
