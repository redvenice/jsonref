Because he\u0027s so grossly disappointed me. \u0027What makes it so bad is that it\u0027s all happening in public now. But I married a public figure, perhaps that\u0027s part of it. \u0027I\u0027m ashamed that we weren\u0027t able to deal with it privately and personally. I think we both made mistakes.\u0027 Asked about a possible reconciliation with Boris, whom she married in 2009, she said: \u0027Absolutely not.

There were nine flying saucers out in the desert near Area 51, he said – ‘flying discs’ being tested and flown and analyzed secretly by the US government. He’d seen them, this mystery man claimed not only that, he’d worked to reverse engineer the propulsion systems on aircraft that would have been ‘totally impossible’ for US officials to have created themselves.‘The propulsion system is a gravity propulsion system,’ the man – going by the pseudonym of ‘Dennis’ – told journalists in the studio. ‘The power source is an antimatter reactor. This technology does not exist at all.‘In fact, one of the reasons I’m coming forward with this information, it’s not only a crime against the American people it’s a crime against the scientific community, which I’ve been part of for some time, who are actively trying to duplicate these systems. Yet they are in existence now, basically, in the hands of the government.’And the government had gone to great lengths to keep him from talking, the ‘scientist’ claimed. He’d been warned that he’d be prosecuted for espionage even his life – and that of his wife – had been threatened, he claimed.‘Anything could happen I don’t know,’ said the man, sounding resigned. ‘I haven’t the slightest idea.’It wouldn’t be long before ‘Dennis’ was unmasked as Bob Lazar, an infamous name that continues to cause controversy and ripples in ufology communities around the world to this day. Type ‘Bob Lazar’ into Google, and almost every site, blog or thread mentioning him is niche, a playground for alien enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists. There’s not a lot about him in the mainstream media, particularly 30 years later.But in November 1989, when he appeared again on television, this time unobscured, Lazar’s coke bottle-glasses and deadpan, bookish appearance became recognizable globally. His claims about working near Area 51 at a hangar called S-4 – where he insisted he’d seen alien aircraft fitted with tiny seats and constructed with a then-undiscovered material called Element 115 – brought news crews from all over the country and the world, throngs of tourists hot on their heels.Scroll down for video           After his initial interview in May 1989, Lazar spoke on the record and on camera in November of the same year, revealing his identity to the world - subsequently unleashing huge waves of curiosity, support and criticism from various factions          Lazar stars in new documentary Bob Lazar: Area 51 and Flying Saucers, which features drawings he made of alien spacecraft he claims to have worked on - such as the above picture - in addition to interviews with his friends and family          Lazar\u0027s explosive 1989 claims attracted the interest of media from around the world, he descended upon the Nevada desert - along with throngs of tourist which continue to make the journey to this day, nearly 30 years later          While Lazar, left, now enjoys a low-profile and rarely speaks about his alleged work, he agreed to participate in the new film - directed by Jeremy Corbell, right - because he says he still receives \u0027emails from people wondering what happened to me and what direction my life took since releasing the information years ago. In addition, I have heard and seen so many fabricated stories and ridiculous versions of my life and experiences that it actually became entertaining. It seemed like there needed to be something on the record – something current’Listening at home in 1989, as Lazar steadfastly stood by his literally out-of-this world claims, was a curious 13-year-old named Jeremy Corbell. While Lazar faded from the public eye as time wore on, Corbell remained riveted by what he’d heard – and now, nearly 30 years later, he has directed new documentary Bob Lazar: Area 51 and Flying Saucers, about the controversial figure – re-investigating Lazar’s assertions and following the scientist to his quiet home in small-town Michigan.‘This concept that I heard on the radio was so transforming to me as a youth, as a kid at 13, that it weaponized my imagination,’ Corbell tells DailyMail.com. ‘It weaponized my curiosity. It forced me to want to become an active participant in learning the truth about UFOs.’Filmmaker Corbell names as his mentor journalist George Knapp, who first introduced Lazar to the world and who has continued investigating extraterrestrial claims over the decades. Knapp features prominently in the documentary, and both he and Corbell exhibit similar personalities: animated but deliberate, drawn as much to unexplained phenomena as soundbites and flowery language. Corbell describes Lazar to DailyMail.com, varyingly, as ‘like the Elvis,’ ‘the Bigfoot,’ and ‘the Messiah’ of ufology.Lazar himself, however, displays the opposite demeanor. He’s matter-of-fact in the documentary his glasses, his haircut, and his deadpan delivery haven’t changed in the slightest since his 1989 TV spot – and neither has his insistence that he saw what he saw, he worked where he worked, and the US government was absolutely studying alien aircraft more than 30 years ago. (The government denied the existence of Area 51 until CIA documents were released five years ago which listed the location as an aerial test site - though not for extraterrestrial spacecraft.)‘It’s changed my life a lot,’ Lazar says in the film, referring to his alleged part in those studies and his decision to go public. ‘It’s probably changed every aspect of it … for the most part, negative. I mean, it’s really difficult to find positive aspects of that. I mean, I’m sure there are some here and there, but most of them were negative.’     A major industry has built up in Nevada around Area 51 and alleged alien research done there, with businesses latching onto the theme to attract traffic and the state even renaming a 92-mile stretch of State Route 375 the Extraterrestrial Highway in 1996 journalist George Knapp says in the film that, after Lazar made his claims in 1989, \u0027every major news organization in the world beat a path to Area 51\u0027            \u0027Tens of thousands of people started showing up out there to see whatever it was that was flying around in the desert they\u0027re still coming, all these years later,\u0027 Knapp says in the film            Lazar claims to have attended MIT and Caltech before working at Los Alamos National Laboratory and near Area 51 at a hangar called S-4 neither school has any record of him attending. He counters: \u0027Do you think Los Alamos just hired me out of high school?\u0027          Phyllis Berliner, Lazar\u0027s mother, shares a story in the film about how her son outfitted a bicycle with \u0027a jet engine\u0027 as a boy she adds: \u0027You believe him or not. It’s a fearful thing to think that there’s something out there that we don’t know anything about. Are they dangerous? Can they hurt us? Will they attack us? You don’t want to know, so you don’t believe it. You’d rather not believe there might be other things out there, other things in the universe. There has to be. We can’t be all by ourselves. We can’t be\u0027          While evidence was never uncovered to support many of Lazar\u0027s claims, his name was found listed in a 1982 Los Alamos phone directory and an article that pre-dated  his TV appearances listed him as a scientist with the national laboratory          Lazar now runs United Nuclear in small-town Michigan, which producers lasers and other scientific materials and equipment he leads a quiet life with his wife, Joy, who told filmmaker Cobell: \u0027I don’t know about UFOs and all this stuff, but I’ll tell you one thing – he’s the most honest person that I have ever met, and I’ve slept next to him for 18 years’‘That’s the important stuff. It almost seems like this is an intentional distraction. You need to pay attention to the bigger picture. If you really want to research all the other stuff, fine, go ahead and do it – but you really need to pay attention to what I’m saying, because I have better things to do than coming up with this.‘I don’t like being in the public eye I don’t have money for doing this – and, quite frankly, I could make up a better lie. But I have no motivation to lie this hasn’t helped me out.’Corbell, for his part, went to great lengths to verify some of Lazar’s claims. The ‘scientist’ had always described a security device which scanned the bones of employees’ hands at secret government locations the filmmaker found one on the internet, and Lazar reacts with a mixture of amazement and satisfaction when Corbell points it out on camera.Lazar had also described a man named Mike Thigpen who he said vetted him for government work Corbell says in the documentary that he tracked the man down to the East Coast, and Thigpen confirmed the information via phone. But Thigpen, Corbell says, declines to appear on camera ‘because he doesn’t want to put a dark shadow on the work he did before – but personally conveyed that was his job, that was exactly what he did in Vegas in 1989.’And various outside developments over the years have also given more weight to Lazar’s story, many claim. Fifteen years ago, an Element 115 was added to the periodic table – moscovium, a radioactive synthetic element first synthesized by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. On top of that, just last year the Department of Defense confirmed for the first time that it had financed a UFO program – after officials denied for decades that any such research had ever existed anywhere within the government.All of those developments – and likely the alleged verifications made by Corbell in his film – serve as a major boon for Lazar’s supporters. The documentary also interviews the people who know him best – his friend, his wife, a United Nuclear employee, even Lazar’s mother – in an effort to get to the heart of who Lazar really is and what he truly believes.Mysterious \u0027cigar-shaped\u0027 UFO spotted hovering in the sky...UFO investigation launched by Irish aviation officials after...Share this articleHis wife, a trim, sharply dressed blond Lazar met more than a decade after his 1989 fame, is ‘a godsend in his life they share great moral strength and fiber and values,’ Corbell tells DailyMail.com.He continues: ‘Bob’s wife doesn’t care about UFOs she didn’t date Bob 18 years ago, get together with Bob … she didn’t even know about the UFOs. They don’t talk about UFOs. That’s not their life that’s not their relationship.‘However, she did tell me one thing. She said something about Bob she said, “I don’t know about UFOs and all this stuff, but I’ll tell you one thing – he’s the most honest person that I have ever met, and I’ve slept next to him for 18 years.\u0027And whatever academic credentials Lazar may or may not have, his mother, Phyllis Berliner, paints the picture of a child gifted with a scientific mind from a very young age. She describes in the film being awoken by a huge bang at 6 o’clock one Sunday morning when Lazar was a boy, after he outfitted his bicycle with ‘a jet engine.’She felt ‘scared out of my mind,’ Berliner says in the documentary. ‘I didn’t know what he was going to do next – was he going to blow up the house? Blow up the world?’She adds: ‘I want him to be happy. If vindication is what he wants, fine. But that’s up to him. You believe him or not. It’s a fearful thing to think that there’s something out there that we don’t know anything about. Are they dangerous? Can they hurt us? Will they attack us? You don’t want to know, so you don’t believe it. You’d rather not believe there might be other things out there, other things in the universe.‘There has to be. We can’t be all by ourselves. We can’t be,’ she says.          Lazar looks as if he has barely aged since his explosive television appearance nearly 30 years ago his trademark coke bottle glasses and deadpan demeanor remain the same          In addition to the work he says he witnessed at Area 51, Lazar tells DailyMail.com: ‘I’m certain research continues involving the working of the alien craft and technology – somewhere in the USA, but I do have to wonder, what other projects government entities might be involved with along the same lines\u0027          Lazar claimed that he he\u0027d been threatened with prosecution for espionage and even death to scare him away from going public he tells DailyMail.com now: ‘At the risk of sounding paranoid, I do always have a suspicion that someone is monitoring me – it’s something that is difficult to get out of my mind’      "},{"url":null,"title":"Georgina Chapman Huma Abedin pictured rare outing NYC grabbing dinner","story":"    Sisters are doin\u0027 it for themselves: Georgina Chapman and Huma Abedin were pictured grabbing dinner in New York City on Sunday night (pair above)          Standin\u0027 on their own two feet: The pair were spotted dining at the Indian eatery Tamarind in Tribeca, just one black from the former offices of The Weinstein Company      The conscious liberation of the female state: Chapman has yet to finalize her orce from estranged husband Harvey Weinstein while Abedin and her jailed ex Anthony Weiner orced last year          Mothers, daughters and their daughters too: The two have known one another for years due to Chapman\u0027s involvement in the Hillary Clinton campaign, and her son Dashiell, 6, would have plays dates with Abedin\u0027s son Jordan, who is the same ageThe two have known one another for years due to Chapman\u0027s involvement in the Hillary Clinton campaign, and her son Dashiell, 6, would have plays dates with Abedin\u0027s son Jordan, who is the same age.Their sons do not attend the same school, but the women used to live just a mile apart from one another.Abedin also spent time in the Hamptons with Chapman back in 2014 and 2015 when her boss Hillary rented the mansion next door to the one that was owned by Weinstein.The mogul has since sold the mansion, along with all his other properties.Georgina Chapman DITCHES Huma Abedin after they share dinner...If looks could kill: Chris Watts stares daggers at wife...REVEALED: Shallow Grave where Chris Watts buried his wife...Share this articleAnd in a Vogue piece about Chapman earlier this year, Abedin was not shy to address the most well-known similarity between the women - their predatory husbands.Weinstein is facing possible criminal charges for the alleged rape and assault of multiple women while Weiner is serving time on charges that stem from his sexual exchanges with an underage minor online.The FBI learned of Weiner\u0027s unlawful actions after DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that the disgraced politician had been exchanging sexually-charged messages with a 15-year-old high school student for close to three months.\u0027This particular club, ironically, it’s not such a small one: women who have had to endure it in such a public way, women like Georgina and me,\u0027 explained Abedin of their husbands\u0027 misconduct.\u0027People don’t feel sorry for us you don’t get that empathy.

He did not settle for anything less than a complete surrender by Jeffrey Epstein,\u0027 Scarola said.           In a statement read by his lawyer, Epstein (pictured in 2008) apologized to and admitted to making \u0027totally false allegations\u0027          Brad Edwards was all smiles while speaking to Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s attorney\u0027s Scott Link and Jack Goldberger prior to a civil settlement announcement made in Palm Beach County Court Tuesday.

He was reportedly allowed out for up to 12 hours a day to visit his office and meet clients.  The \u0027non prosecution\u0027 deal with the state also meant he, his named co-conspirators and his unnamed co-conspirators were given immunity from federal prosecution.  The deal was also sealed from the public and the victims, meaning no one would  ever learn the entirety of Epstein\u0027s crimes. It was revealed last week that the deal was brokered by President Trump\u0027s Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta when he was US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.              Trump\u0027s current Labor Secretary Alex Acosta (right) was the top federal prosecutor in Miami that brokered the deal to have Epstein serve just over a year behind bars instead of life behind bars In the second case mentioned by Scarola today, his client Edwards is suing the US government on behalf of three victims in the sex investigation.  He alleges it violated the Crime Victims\u0027 Right Act, which states victims should be kept informed of possible hearings and \u0027reasonably heard\u0027 over pleas and sentencing.  Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s victims could finally have their day in...Killer dad Chris Watts has been secretly moved from a...Share this articleEdwards wrote in a court filing that if the victims knew about the non-prosecution agreement \u0027they would have taken steps to object\u0027, according to the New York Times.      Epstein could be stripped of his criminal prosecution immunity if the case succeeds, possibly leading to a federal trial for the sex crimes. Scarola had said earlier this week that the purpose of the second case is to \u0027invalidate Epstein\u0027s non-prosecution agreement\u0027 which also granted immunity to his co-conspirators. At a press conference after the hearing, Mr Scarola re-emphasized the bid to quash Epstein\u0027s plea deal.He said: \u0027We have tried for a long time to convey the injustice done to Bradley Edwards and the injustice that continues to be done to the victims of Epstein\u0027s abuse as a consequence of the plea bargain that not only resulted in immunity for Jeffrey Epstein, but handed out get-out-of-jail cards to his named and unnamed co-conspirators as well.\u0027That injustice needs to be addressed and will be addressed through the pro bono efforts of Bradley Edwards and his co-counsel.\u0027Mr Edwards told reporters: \u0027I am getting calls from my clients who have been hidden but pushed into silence, scared to death, finally saying thank you for standing up to him (Epstein) and sending him to the brink until he had to admit you win, he lost.\u0027They are willing to talk.

It has already affected the lives of nearly three million girls and young women across sub-Saharan Africa.Its CEO, Lucy Lake, who was with the sixth in line to the throne in Zambia, revealed to the Mail that she had briefed his wife privately at Kensington Palace earlier this year about their work in the country, as well as Zimbabwe, Ghana, Tanzania and Malawi.The Duchess was also met with Zimbabwean-born Angeline Murimirwa, one of the first girls to go to secondary school with the organisation\u0027s support and is now its African executive director.

Big fan of yours!’I replied, and for the next few months, we corresponded on a regular basis.We’d chat about everything from US gun violence (she shares my horror of it) to a charity trip she made for the United Nations to Rwanda, spinning classes, calligraphy, and our joint hatred of 4am filming call-times - hers for Suits and mine for Good Morning Britain in the UK.She even started sending me early preview episodes of her show so we could debate juicy storylines yet to air – which we did, at length.Meghan introduced me via cyberspace to another Suits cast member, Rick Hoffman - who played Louis Litt – and he and I also began to regularly correspond. He described their relationship to me as so close it felt like ‘brother and sister’.In February 2016, Rick came to London and at my invitation, he appeared on Good Morning Britain.Nobody really knew who he was here, nor Meghan for that matter, but we had a fun interview and I sent the photos to Meghan afterwards - who was thrilled by them.          When her co-star Hoffman was in London in early 2016, I had him on my show - even though no one knew who he was in the UK. They didn\u0027t know who Meghan was either thenMeghan and Harry set to stay with Kate and William at Anmer...\u0027She social climbed her way out of my orbit\u0027: Piers Morgan...Samantha Markle mocks sister Meghan over claims she wanted...Share this articleIn early June, 2016, she messaged me to say: ‘I’m in London for a week of meetings and Wimbledon. Would love to say hi!’I suggested my local pub, the Scarsdale Tavern in Kensington – ironically just a few hundred yards from where she now lives at Kensington Palace.‘Serena Williams sends her love,’ she texted on the day from Wimbledon, where she was watching her friend play in the annual tennis tournament. ‘You’re very popular as it turns out. Get you!’I don’t hear those words very often, so they made an impression…Then she turned up at the pub and we had a very enjoyable time for 90 minutes or so before I put her in a taxi to a dinner she was having with friends at 5 Hertford Street, a fashionable club in London’s Mayfair.She spoke very candidly about her family - there were some private, sensitive things she told me I would never repeat because they were said in confidence - Donald Trump (she’s not a fan), and of course, Suits.She asked me for advice on her career and the media, and if she could come on Good Morning Britain next time she was over, which I said I would arrange.From the cab, Meghan sent me a series of texts thanking me and saying she was looking forward to meeting up again next time we were in the same city.She even publicly tweeted about how nice it was to see her ‘friend’ – me – in London.So at this point, I was indeed labouring under the massive misapprehension that we were friends.I was wrong.She met Prince Harry at the dinner that night, went on a solo date with him the next night, and I never heard from her again.Not a word.I’d been ghosted.          She met Prince Harry at a dinner the night we met in person, went on a solo date with him the next night, and I never heard from her again. Or her costar. I\u0027d been used. They were just rudeAnd not just by her.At Meghan’s behest, Rick Hoffman ghosted me too.I didn’t hear from him again for 18 months, then he eventually crawled out of the woodwork after attending the big royal wedding last May.‘Piers! I am very sorry for not responding,’ he wrote in a lengthy message. ‘You must understand, once I heard the news, out of respect for Meghan, I couldn’t share a thing. Now I can share fun stuff! I would love to catch up at that favorite pub of yours. Hope to hear from you pal. Love you pal. Rick.’I didn’t reply, because no, I didn’t ‘understand’.A real ‘pal’ doesn’t ghost a friend for 18 months, right?That’s just rude.In fact, I found the behaviour of the pair of them damn rude.I’d been ‘played’ by a couple of B-list actors, who were clearly just using me to advance their careers.           From the moment I read that Harry barked ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets! at staff in the run-up to the wedding, my heart sankBut when someone more important and influential came along, in the shape of Prince Harry, I was instantly dumped like a sack of spuds (that’s what we call potatoes in the UK).Now, on a certain level, I grudgingly admire the work.And frankly, who am I, a former tabloid newspaper editor, to take a dim view of such ruthless antics?But on another level, the whole experience left me feeling suspicious and cynical about Ms Markle.And nothing in her behaviour since marrying Prince Harry has alleviated those concerns.From the moment I read that he barked ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets! at palace courtiers in the run-up to the wedding, my heart sank.Because I fear that’s exactly what she’s used to getting.And anyone or anything that may not give her what she wants or gets in the way of her social climbing self-advancement gets discarded.Her first husband? Ditched as her Suits career took off.Her dysfunctional family? Banned from the wedding – all of them.Her poor old ailing Dad? Cut off and disowned for struggling to cope with media attention about his daughter.Meghan’s swapped her dreary, problematic old real world for a thrilling new fantasy world of the Queen, Michelle Obama and the Clooneys.Only her mother Doria made the cut to Princess Meghan’s AAA-list new life.          Her first husband Trevor was ditched as her Suits career took off          She ditched her family, cut off her ailing father and and only mom Doria made the list to Princess Meghan’s AAA-list new lifeBut pieces of work never change their spots.Now, there is a steady flow of negative stories streaming from Palace ‘insiders’ about Meghan’s alleged a antics.She was said to have ‘displeased’ the Queen by demanding an emerald tiara for the wedding.There are rumours of a growing rift with the Duchess of Cambridge, who was reported to have burst into tears over Meghan’s hostile behaviour during a bridesmaid dress fitting for her daughter Princess Charlotte.Kate was also reported to have complained about Meghan being needlessly unpleasant to a royal member of staff.          Now, there is a steady flow of negative stories streaming from Palace ‘insiders’ about Meghan’s antics and rumors of a rift with the Duchess of Cambridge, who she reportedly made cry. Kate has also reportedly complained that Meghan is unpleasant to a member of staffMeghan’s personal assistant Melissa Toubati recently quit after just six months in the job after also being left in tears.Royal courtiers are said to be already ‘fed up’ with her domineering and dictatorial attitude that involves daily 5am email demands and even led to her apparently insisting on air fresheners to hide the ‘musty odour’ of St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle.It was an absurd request that was very firmly denied.When Palace ‘insiders’ start leaking this amount of damaging mud, you can be certain that much of it is true.And given my unfortunate experience with her, I’m afraid I’m not remotely surprised.It’s got nothing to do with sexism or racism, as some ridiculous commentators have suggested.No, I think it’s far simpler than that: Meghan Markle is a self-obsessed professional actress who has landed the role of her life and is determined to milk it for all she’s worth.

The academy\u0027s move was intended to rope in more box-office hits to the broadcast, but critics said such a category would potentially ghettoize films like \u0027Black Panther\u0027 from the prestigious honor of best picture. (Coogler declined to address the category\u0027s scuttling.)While superhero films have dominated multiplexes for the last decade, the Oscars have been famously resistant to them. Ten years ago, \u0027The Dark Knight\u0027 earned eight nominations but missed out on best picture, prompting the film academy to expand the category the following year.   Coogler had a sense he wasn\u0027t alone in wanting a connection to the film, that others felt a need for it, too. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I could never imagine to the extent that it did\u0027          With more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales, the film has the third-highest all-time domestic grossMany of the academy\u0027s members resent how superheroes have come to dominate the industry, but there have been some signs lately that anti-Marvel sentiment is ebbing. Last year, while \u0027Wonder Woman\u0027 failed to earn a nod, the Wolverine sequel \u0027Logan\u0027 became the first superhero film nominated for best adapted screenplay . This year, best animated film may also be a superhero battle, with \u0027Incredibles 2\u0027 and \u0027Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u0027 among the favorites.But the awards campaign for \u0027Black Panther\u0027 is predicated less on its superhero DNA than on its cultural impact and on its personal nature as, despite its budget, an auteur film by one of the most widely respected young filmmakers in Hollywood. \u0027Black Panther\u0027 last week for a day played for free in arthouse theaters nationwide in an event put on by Art House Convergence and Film Comment.George H.W.

It was a journey in finding his own connection to Africa. While developing the script, he visited South Africa, Kenya and the Kingdom of Lesotho - a tiny nation that inspired Coogler\u0027s Wakanda.\u0027In simple terms, the film is what brought me to the continent,\u0027 says Coogler. \u0027It was kind of a lifelong thing just to get there and see it. The thing that I found was a sense of identity as an African person. I found in those trips and through that research a definition for myself of what it means to be African.

It was the No. 1 film at the U.S. box office for five straight weeks.\u0027We always saw it as a film to watch with your loved ones, with your friends and with strangers, in communal settings,\u0027 says Coogler. \u0027People are still interested in doing that and it feels fortunate.\u0027In a year where Netflix has a formidable Oscar contender in Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s \u0027Roma,\u0027 and fears of the diminishing of the theatrical experience pervade the industry, that may be the most appealing reason for academy members to vote for \u0027Black Panther\u0027: It proved the still-vibrant, earth-shattering power of the movie theater.

But she is far from being well known and the jury said her recent work represented a breakthrough into a new, more expansive way of working.Speaking after her win, Prodger said: “I feel very honoured, blown away really. It’s quite surreal. It feels lovely.”The artist said she used an iPhone for her work because she was on her own a lot and the phone felt like an extension of her: “Because of that ease of use and the way you can use it while you are going about the world. For me, everything is in there.”Asked what she might do with the prize money, Prodger said: “I’ll live on it. I’ll pay my rent and my studio rent and some bills. Maybe there’ll be a little treat … probably a nice jacket. Don’t hold me to that!” Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain, who chaired the judging panel, said Prodger’s work represented the “most profound use of a device as prosaic as the iPhone camera that we’ve seen in art to date”.Prodger, 44, won for her solo exhibition at the Bergen Kunsthall in Norway, which featured two film works, Bridgit and Stoneymollan Trail. The 32-minute film Bridgit has been on display at Tate Britain as part of its Turner prize exhibition.The film is difficult to explain. There is lots going on, a lot of it apparently randomly. It explores class, gender, sexuality and neolithic goddesses.Prodger filmed the work over the course of a year and included footage of her at home and on her travels. Her narration includes snatches of autobiography – coming out in Aberdeenshire in the early 90s, people being unable to tell whether she is a boy or girl, the assumption that her girlfriend is her daughter. She also quotes from Julian Cope’s The Modern Antiquarian.The artist has described the piece as being about the fluidity of identity from a queer perspective an exploration of the intertwining of landscape, body, technology and time.Farquharson said the jury felt Bridgit was “incredibly impressive in the way that it dealt with lived experience, the formation of a sense of self through disparate references”. He said the work evoked traditions in landscape art and had psychological weight. “It ends up being so unexpectedly expansive. This is not what we expect from video clips shot on iPhones.”It took the jury more than four hours to reach its decision. “I think the jury was united in a feeling that this work was introducing something new to the filmic medium and how it is used in art,” Farquharson said.All four nominees – three iniduals and a collective – made film work, all of it in some way political. Depending on your perspective, this year’s exhibition was either the most wonderfully captivating in memory or the hardest work. Certainly, it is not a show that should be experienced quickly the Tate recommends four and a half hours.It has ided critics. The Observer’s Laura Cumming called it the best in years, “by turns shattering, absorbing, beguiling, highly political, frequently momentous”. Waldemar Januszczak in the Sunday Times wrote: “From beginning to end, this soul-crusher of a show is unusually awful.”The favourite of many visitors had been Forensic Architecture, a collective that has been described as an “architectural detective agency” investigating state crimes and human rights abuses across the world.Based at Goldsmiths, University of London, the group consists of architects, film-makers, journalists, archaeologists, scientists, lawyers and software developers. For the Turner prize show, it exhibited the results of its investigations into deaths during a 2017 pre-dawn raid by Israeli police on a Bedouin village in the Negev desert.The Turner prize, running since 1984, often exasperates and thrills in equal measure and is no stranger to controversy. The closest it came this year was protests against the artist Luke Willis Thompson, a New Zealander of European and Fijian heritage.Some took exception to his video work Autoportrait, a silent film portrait of Diamond Reynolds, the girlfriend of Philando Castile, who was shot dead by police in Minnesota. Thompson was accused of casting a white, middle-class gaze on cases of black suffering. A group of protesters wearing T-shirts reading Black Pain Is Not for Profit sat in protest on the exhibition sofas in September.The fourth artist nominated was Naeem Mohaiemen, who exhibited two 90-minute films, one about a man living alone in an abandoned airport, the other about moments in the history of Bangladesh.The winner was decided by a jury comprising Oliver Basciano, an art critic Elena Filipovic, director of the Kunsthalle Basel Lisa Le Feuvre, executive director of the Holt-Smithson Foundation and the novelist Tom McCarthy.Last year’s Turner prize exhibition was in Hull. This year’s was in London, and next year the circus rolls on to Margate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b797d63ea6aa8b0eb6d34a35d4230cb21b01166/0_0_3543_2876/master/3543.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a6ff93e17cbddd3ea31ed9e1a42d5a7 700w","title":"canada marijuana legalization environment impact","story":"The focus on human health with Canada’s legalization has highlighted the lack of discussion on the potential effects of on freshwater suppliesIn a flurry of international news, after years of false starts and political wrangling, it was finally written into law: Justin Trudeau’s administration legalized recreational marijuana use in Canada.Admittedly, the course of true legalization never did run smooth. A myriad of complex province-specific regulations and policies have emerged that have served to reflect the fractured political nature of Canada’s federation, but also to mildly puzzle its citizens.Much of the information that had been shared ahead of the big day was intended to clear up some of the public’s confusion focused on the human health risks of cannabis consumption. Billboards and advertising in suitably green font have warned Toronto and Vancouver’s denizens of how smoking marijuana can impair one’s ability to drive, trigger schizophrenia and other mental health issues, and stoke addiction.While all admirable and necessary warnings, this focus on human health has highlighted the notable lack of public or governmental discussion on the potential impact of cannabis on the environment, and in particular on North America’s abundant supplies of fresh water.Often featuring in the lower rungs of priority when it comes to determining the safety of a drug, the impact of a pharmaceutical on the freshwater environment can be significant on the health of lakes, rivers and those who reside nearby.The gamut is wide and worrying – from limpets in the UK no longer able to cling on to rocks for survival as they “bathe in a soup” of antidepressants to Canadian male fish growing eggs in their testes after being exposed to the synthetic estrogen found in birth control pills.These examples should serve as a reminder that when deeming a drug fit for market, we should research and factor in its impact on the environment and water systems.As the tide of marijuana legalization seems to be steadily sweeping North America, it also highlights how the USA and Canada, with our shared watersheds and borderless water movement, need to put our heads together on this issue.When it comes to marijuana, a lot of the research and legislation is patchy and regionally specific. In Canada, some legislation exists to limit the use of more than 95 pesticides that can be used by licensed cannabis producers. There is also guidance to prevent these compounds from leeching into nearby water bodies and reaching its flora and fauna.But we need to know more.Historically, economic development of the continent has depended on its networks of lakes and rivers, and today it provides places to swim, fish for food, and boat – helping to fuel economic activity in the recreation and tourism industry. Put simply, every economic sector in North American depends on fresh water.We are still limited in our understanding of how much recreational use of cannabis in Canada will increase thanks to legalization. Some projections suggest a steep increase, but we need to be tracking consumption to know what could be leeching into our water.Second, when cannabis itself is metabolized by humans and excreted into our water supplies, it can result in risks that are yet poorly understood and that are not accounted for when just applied pesticides are examined. We need more research to fill those information gaps.Our water flows freely across our continent cannabis flowing down from British Columbia will not stop short at the border with Idaho.North America’s governments, scientists and industry need to work together to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the effects of marijuana on fresh water, and update wastewater treatment facilities and regulations to protect our lakes and rivers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c33668c2ab740faab30e074e5f0cee476b14665b/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b717ca08ade2b3d7b601462f07cd6f49","title":"the guardian view on brexit the beginning of the end","story":"Brexit is often sold by its most committed supporters on the right as a constitutional version of the economic doctrine of Thatcherism, a clean break with the failed policies of the past. These fanatics succeeded in convincing David Cameron, who was prone to flattery but supine in the face of aggression, that a popular vote in a referendum was a remedy for the unrepresentative nature of Westminster politics. Once they did away with Mr Cameron, they installed Theresa May and carried on with legislative manoeuvring to enable an irreversible transformation of society. The hard Brexiters are ruthless about the means, and in denial about the fall-out of their desires. Yet now the game is up.The evidence is that a departure from the European Union on WTO terms would blow up large parts of the British economy. There would be a lot of pain for some far-off gain. As it stands Mrs May’s Brexit plan will not get parliamentary approval. She warns this means we will crash out as the law states the United Kingdom will leave the EU on the 29 March at 11pm. But that can be changed if a minister proposes a new law erasing that time and date and parliament votes for it. The UK has options. It can unilaterally cancel its withdrawal from the EU. The majority of MPs in parliament accept hard Brexit utopias cannot be built. It is now a question of how, not when or if, they will move parliamentary motions to demonstrate their strength. Their aim will be to get ministers to defer or rescind Britain’s departure from the European club. Mrs May, if she is still prime minister, at this point could do the country a favour and stop her car crash of Brexit continuing. If ministers refuse to bow to such a motion then we will enter a constitutional crisis whose size will dwarf anything we have seen so far in the contempt arguments over the failure to publish ministers’ Brexit legal advice.This marks the end of a long spell of party government. In 2015 the Conservative party won the majority of parliamentary seats for the first time in 23 years. Mr Cameron became prime minister. His government was responsible not to the parliament, but to Tory MPs who relied for their electoral success on the party organisation, which in turn controlled the parliamentary party. The 2017 election saw Mrs May lose her majority and MPs lose their instant allegiance to her and her machine. She ought to have dropped the hard Brexit rhetoric then and there. Instead she continued and attempted to rule through decree while pushing the biggest geopolitical shift this country has faced in decades. She factionalised her party, sharpening ideological isions between “Global Britain” and “Make Britain Great Again” Tories that have proved too wide to manage.The result is Mrs May ended up only passing bills that have complete support within her own party, which was in thrall to rightwing absolutists. The danger of this way of running Westminster is that it ends up being self-reinforcing, making for more extreme partisanship and deeper deadlock. Studies show barely two in 10 people now think the current system of governing Britain is good at performing any of its key functions. In parliamentary systems, gridlock is relatively rare. When prime ministers can no longer command legislative support, the impasse is resolved by a new election. If she attempted to do this anytime soon, Mrs May would surely be deposed. The prime minister has caught herself in a Brexit straightjacket that gets tighter the more she struggles. There is scope for a Houdini-like escape for Britain. But to achieve what seems the impossible requires a politician prepared to imagine it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/285322b1a3e35ede2f09e9b58aa81a18405201a8/0_0_941_570/master/941.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c5aa072cc3b64286ef5040505b8d4d2f 1880w","title":"pitt rivers museum oxford maasai colonial artefacts","story":"Western museums are full of plundered objects. So what happened when a Maasai delegation travelled to the UK to discover where their sacred belongings ended up?Around a large table in a bright room in the University of Oxford’s Pitt Rivers Museum, four members of the Maasai tribe from east Africa are inspecting a small object. It has been carefully placed in front of them by a curator wearing special handling gloves. The Maasai say that it is a bracelet, an orkatar. They talk between themselves, in the maa language, about what the bracelet is used for. “This is something that cannot be sold or given,” says Yannick Ndoinyo, a junior elder from Loliondo, northern Tanzania. The orkatar symbolises the death of a father and is a form of inheritance that passes down the generations. How did it end up in a museum in Oxford? Perhaps it was stolen from the original owner or given away under duress. According to the database, it was “donated” to the Pitt Rivers Museum in 1904 by Alfred Claud Hollis, a colonial administrator in British East Africa.This encounter between the Pitt Rivers, one of the most important ethnological museums in the world, and the Maasai is part of a process of cultural decolonisation. The relationship began when Maasai activist Samwel Nangiria visited the museum in November last year for a conference. The Pitt Rivers has more than 300,000 objects in its collection, many of which were “acquired” by colonial functionaries, missionaries and anthropologists in the heyday of the British empire. The museum itself is curated in a peculiar style – in line with the request of benefactor Augustus Pitt Rivers – with objects organised according to type rather than place of origin. This Victorian aesthetic has been consciously upheld: the Pitt Rivers is often referred to as a “museum of a museum”. There are shrunken heads from the Amazon and rudimentary tools from India a magisterial totem pole from the Haida community in Canada towers above the central, darkened atrium.Nangiria, a purposeful and diplomatic presence, expressed his displeasure to the museum’s director, Laura Van Broekhoven. She sent him a copy of the museum’s strategic plan for the future and invited him back. Keenly aware of its problematic origins, the Pitt Rivers, like many museums, engages “originating communities” – in the museum-world lingo – to allow them to reclaim the narrative around their objects. Last month, Nangiria, with four other Maasai from Tanzania and Kenya, and help from the Oxford-based NGO InsightShare, returned to do so.One purpose of the weeklong visit was to provide the museum with more accurate information. The database was littered with errors and gaps: it transpires that an object marked as a Maasai bracelet is actually an anklet a trinket made for an unknown purpose in fact plays a vital role in circumcision rituals. After a Maasai sword is laid down on the table, Marina de Alarcón, joint head of collections, tells us that the museum takes great care when holding arrows, assuming that their tips – as is Maasai custom – are poisoned. Francis Shomet Ole Naingisa, a village elder, duly confirms this: “If the poison mixes with your blood then you have five minutes left.”The relationship between European museums and the people from whom their collections were taken has never been more fraught. The same week as the Maasai visit, Tarita Alarcón Rapu, governor of Easter Island, begged for the return of the Hoa Hakananai’a statue from the British Museum in a tearful message that went viral: “You, the British people, have our soul.”A few days later came the publication of a report commissioned by President Emmanuel Macron, who had expressed his desire to see colonial-era items in France returned to Africa. Macron has his own reasons for this type of cultural diplomacy: it eases the passage of further economic and military cooperation with Francophone Africa. Nonetheless, the report is bold, recommending that France return African treasures if governments request them.Museums handle the question of repatriation as delicately as their objects. The Museum Association’s policy statement notes that it is a “complex issue involving a range of emotional, ethical, legal and political factors”. In my interviews I heard suspicion from some in the museum world about the politicised nature of state-to-state transactions, while the legal framework governing returns can be ambiguous, as has been with the case with recovering art stolen during the second world war. The British Museum has agreed to hold talks about Hoa Hakananai’a, but a likely conclusion will be a temporary return on loan, as was the case with Nigeria’s Benin bronzes.Will the Maasai be able to facilitate the return of sacred objects? Van Broekhoven tells me over email that “in principle”, and provided they find funding, the museum is ready to “learn together how we might envision new ways of redress”. The words are carefully chosen. Nangiria, ever the diplomat, suggests an alternative solution in one of our conversations: inviting elders to perform a spiritual ceremony that will “disconnect” the objects from their cultural function, allowing the Maasai to actively donate them to the museum. The museum will wait to hear from the elders to “jointly decide” on the next steps in the partnership.At a public event on the final day of their visit, the five Maasai, led by Scholastica Ene Kukutia, a women’s rights activist from Kenya, perform a ritual in the museum. Standing on the balcony overseeing the collection, sporting red shukas and bejewelled with earrings and necklaces that chime as they move, the group sing a melodious incantation that speaks of a meeting between “great cultures”. Attendees cry, as does Nangiria. He thanks the museum for “opening its doors” to them.But history always finds a way to seep through to the present, especially in a city like Oxford. The day before, I joined the Maasai at the university’s Weston Library. Enduring the November cold, they posed for a photograph on a balcony that frames the city’s skyline: implacable limestone that speaks of centuries of imperial wealth. Inside, they were shown archival maps of Maasai territory. The British engineered a forced migration, at gunpoint, of the Maasai at the turn of the century, moving them from one of the most fertile plains of Kenya to a drier part of Tanzania. Nangiria pores over the maps to see the changing contours of his people’s land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/236464e898aefc157ff3e4265eae66eff905664c/0_90_4650_2790/master/4650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87e32576502484fddec7c9c525323022","title":"the lowdown on ottawa canadas capital city","story":"Whether you want to do mass yoga, visit parliament, try a BeaverTail pastry or ice skate on the Rideau canal – Ottawa has something for every visitor …The city of Ottawa has a wonderful setting, its centre perched on cliffs above the churning Ottawa River and overlooking the peaceful rolling forests of the Gatineau Hills. Once a rowdy lumber town, it quietly developed into one of the country’s most handsome and liveable cities federal money backed impressive architecture and still supports a rash of top-flight national museums, while careful planning kept the city centre walkable and put the great outdoors a mere 15-minute drive away. There’s also a sizeable gastro and brewpub scene, along with a packed festival calendar. And there’s an appetite for some unusual activities too: how about the weekly mass drop-in yoga sessions on the parliament’s iconic lawns, or ice-skating the Rideau canal – the world’s largest rink – in the very centre of the city with a BeaverTail pastry in hand? See it for yourself …Food and drink form a big part of the Ottawa lifestyle. Farmers’ markets always bustle and hot new restaurants continually pop up around a city that already boasts the full range of choices, including dozens of ethnic eateries in districts such as Chinatown. Try the classic French cuisine at Sur Lie, or the innovative menus at Stofa. Elsewhere, the emphasis is often on casual and healthy, with modern vegetarian places such as Pure Kitchen as popular as any. Ottawa’s microbreweries all thrive too, with craft ales universally loved: the city’s beer festivals, such as the Winter Brewfest in February or the Ottawa Beerfest in June, burst at the seams brewery bus tours thrive and getting a table at a hip beer-focused restaurant, such as Bar Lupulus can be a challenge. Alongside the award-winning chefs and popular eateries is the much-loved BeaverTails pastry stand: its speciality is a huge doughnut flattened into the shape of a beaver’s tail then smothered with a topping. Barack Obama made sure he got one when he visited as president in 2009.Tours of Ottawa’s gothic parliament buildings are not to be missed you can visit both the House of Commons and the new Senate to observe democracy in action. The city’s national museums are another strongpoint, partly for their distinctly Canadian twist. From reconstructed polar environments to birch-bark canoes and contemporary art, all provide a wonderful window on the nation.The Canadian Museum of History has a particularly insightful glut of historical artefacts, including an extraordinary totem pole collection. For greater insights into today’s Canadian culture try the National Gallery of Canada, where airy contemporary art displays steal the show from old masters. Better still, take in a show at the dynamic National Arts Centre, whose bilingual performing arts programme includes all sorts of music, dance and theatre. Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot appears in November and the NAC English Theatre has highlights of Prince Hamlet, Angelique and The Pigeon King early next year.Ottawa has a reputation for a dramatic climate, based on temperatures that swing between –30C and +30C and, no matter the weather, the city excels at making the most of the outdoors all year round.An extraordinary 500-mile network of cycle paths, many groomed for skiing in winter, is a key asset and with many being attractive riverside affairs, getting about by bike is often the best way to see the city.Otherwise, the Gatineau Hills are the main destination for summer hiking and biking, while in winter they support one of Canada’s premier cross-country skiing networks, as well as good snowshoeing to remote cabins and some downhill skiing at Camp Fortune. All this is nicely rounded off by the Nordik Spa-Nature with its medley of rustic saunas, hot tubs, treatments and massages.Avoiding Ottawa’s January and February extremes might seem wise, but then you’d miss all the fun of the February Winterlude festival – a carnival of ice sculpting, canal skating and BeaverTail bingeing.

Fun-loving, festival-obsessed Montreal itself is a bustling metropolis, home to nearly 2 million people, while the province’s capital, Québec City, may be more modestly sized but packs a historical punch.The mighty St Lawrence River slices through Québec’s south-eastern edge, lined on either side with a succession of pretty towns and villages. Here, away from the urban sprawls, you’ll see whales, bears and birds and more, in their natural habitat. And all across the province you’ll find delicious and award-winning food, which uses the best fresh, local produce.With so much prime, arable land, it’s no wonder Québec has a strong farm-to-table scene. You can follow the Flavour Trail in Charlevoix, north of Québec City, a 30-mile route stretching from Petite-Riviere-Saint-Francois to La Malbaie, encompassing cheesemakers, lavender-growers, apple orchards, breweries, and even an emu farm. Try some of the results of these delicious ingredients at the charmingly rustic Faux Bergers in Baie-Saint-Paul.On the south bank of the river, in the tiny waterside city of Rimouski, chef Colombe Saint-Pierre scours the St Lawrence River for bounty such as crayfish and lobster to cook in her restaurant, Chez Saint-Pierre. At the other end of the scale, the award-winning Toqué restaurant in Montreal places those regional ingredients at the centre of classic French-style cuisine, under the auspices of renowned chef Normand Laprise.Québec is big on microbreweries, too the province has over 150 of them, and celebrates beer with several festivals, from Québec City’s Festibiere, to the festival des Bieres de Laval. In Montreal, look out for quirky Dieu du Ciel! which sells 20 of its beers on tap, or Le Saint Bock, which has over 40 – it even makes poutine with beer.For wine-lovers, the Eastern Townships in south-eastern Québec province is the place to explore. Here, among picturesque rural towns and villages, you will find over 20 wineries, as well as some great restaurants using ingredients sourced from local rivers, lakes, forests and fields. Try Le Hatley at Manoir Hovey in North Hatley or, for a vegan option – with many ingredients grown in the back garden – Gaïa, in Bromont.As you might expect, a big city like Montreal is positively brimming with galleries, museums, and cultural experiences. The historic and the modern sit side by side – just yards away from the cobblestones of Old Montreal, for instance, is La Grande Roue, a 60-metre-high observation wheel that was opened in September 2017 to celebrate the city’s 375th birthday. From your cabin, you get great views across to Mount Royal hill. Also you can see Jacques Cartier Bridge, which, every evening, becomes an interactive, illuminated art piece called Living Connections. Social media users can dictate the patterns it forms using a Twitter hashtag.The city also uses light for Aura, an immersive, son et lumiere experience at the magnificent Notre Dame Cathedral. And you can learn more about Montreal’s history via Cité Mémoire, a series of projections on to historic or significant buildings around the Old Port, which tell the story of the city.To see all Montreal’s public art, pick up the public art map. You can create your own cultural walk – and get to know the city intimately at the same time.In Québec City, find out more about the region’s aboriginal people, and how the province came into being, at the striking Musée de la Civilisation or browse over 38,000 artworks at the Musée National des Beaux-Arts. There are also scores of beautiful churches to visit, such as the 300-year-old Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, with its 19th-century frescoes that tell the story of both the church and the city. Twenty miles up the St Lawrence River, you will find the ornate Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré and its recent addition – a striking 10-metre-high fountain of Saint Anne.Québec is primed for an outdoor lifestyle, its mix of mountains and rural farmland peppered with dense pine forests, steel-grey lakes, and emerald, patchwork fields. About 80 miles north-east of Montreal is Mont-Tremblant, one of the province’s main and most popular ski resorts. In winter, you can ski one of its 95 pistes, but you can also visit year-round for its golf courses and hiking trails.Whale watching around the St Lawrence River is incredibly popular belugas stay there year-round, and, during feeding season (May to October), you’ll also spot minkes, fin whales, and even humpbacks. You can see them in the Saguenay–St Lawrence marine park from three regions: Charlevoix (Tadoussac), Côte-Nord (Les Escoumins) or Bas-Saint-Laurent (Rimouski).If you prefer your creatures more furry, head to the Domaine le Pic-Bois, where you can observe black bears at close quarters. And if you just want to stretch your legs while taking in beautiful scenery, head to one of Québec’s national parks. Parc national de la Jacques-Cartier is just half an hour from Québec City, and has a spectacular glacial valley or you could visit parc national de la Gaspésie, where deer, moose and caribou roam.There’s plenty to do here all year round, and, unsurprisingly, Québec does winter very well. The bonus of snow means you can enjoy a range of sports and outdoor pursuits, from snowmobiling to skiing and snow-shoeing. You’ll also warm up pretty soon at the coldest music festival in the world, January’s Igloofest, and the Carnaval de Québec in February, with its parades, parties and outdoor sporting events.In spring, go cider-tasting on the Ile-aux-Coudres, an island in the St Lawrence River, or brave the zipline over the nearby Montmorency Falls, 30 metres higher than Niagara. For culture vultures, the festival TransAmériques in Montreal in late May and early June showcases three weeks of world-class drama and dance directed by top choreographers, artistic directors and playwrights.Summer’s the best time to stroll around cities and discover street art, or head to one of the big festivals in Montreal. Try the Jazz festival in June and July, Just for Laughs in July, or the Fringe festival in May and June.In Québec City, check out the festival d’Été de Québec, an 11-day music festival in July that attracts some of pop and rock’s biggest stars. Foodies should note First Fridays, where the biggest gathering of street food trucks in Québec pitch up at the Parc Olympique on the first Friday of every month, from May to October.Watch the foliage burst into colour in the autumn around Mont-Saint-Anne, and don’t miss the Great Color Adventure, a fall event featuring more than 145 km of cross-country and downhill mountain bike trails, and great hiking trails.Discover adventures all over Québec with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69d8bf4197f0431930b5b940cead27b15ab6129a/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fed11099b379fa115ffd7aa7b3c9ff5","title":"watch it or do it where to see and try canadas best sports","story":"Marathons, races, international contests … There’s much more to Canada’s sporting scene than the world’s best ice hockey.

The race weekend features a 10km runwalk, a half marathon, and a full marathon that takes participants through Fogo’s beautiful, untamed wilderness. If you’re not running yourself, you can cheer on the returning marathoners in the picturesque village of Tilting, or go for a scenic hike through the island’s 200km of paths and trails. It’s worth the ferry ride alone to stay and dine at the architecturally stunning Fogo Island Inn. Fun fact: members of the Flat Earth Society consider the island one of the four corners of the planet.Canadian Football: 106th Grey Cup – Edmonton, Alberta, 25 November 2018The biggest night of the Canadian Football season will take place this year in Edmonton, Alberta, with the 106th Grey Cup game. A five-day, fan-friendly festival precedes the big game, a Canadian tradition dating back to 1909. This Grey Cup game is outdoors, so if you can snag a ticket, be sure to bundle up ... and don’t forget your face-paint. Canadian football, with its unique quirks, is particularly popular in Western Canada where fans never sit on their hands, no matter how cold it gets. For your own taste of three-down fun, The Edmonton Sports and Social Club has an indoor Flag Football League that begins on 23 September and runs for five weeks. Perfect for all beginners, flag football is a great non-contact introduction to Canadian Football and friendly Edmontonians.World Junior Hockey Championships – Vancouver, British Columbia, 26 December 2018-5 January 2019The World Junior Hockey Tournament has become a favourite year-end tradition in Canada, as the best young hockey players on the planet take part in a two-week tournament that culminates in a must-watch gold medal game. This year, Vancouver, BC, plays host at Rogers Arena, where traditional rivals Team Canada and Team USA remain the heavy favourites, with the young Swedes of Tre Kronor a close third. If that inspires you to lace up your own skates, check out the Robson Square Ice Rink, a beautifully lit, domed outdoor rink in the heart of Vancouver. An evening skate is popular with locals, and many of Van City’s best nocturnal snack options, including some top-notch food trucks, are close by. Skates can be hired for as little as Can$4 (£2.40).Curling: the Tim Hortons Brier – Brandon, Manitoba, 2-10 March 2019You can cut the tension with a broom at the Tim Hortons Brier where the country’s best male curlers have competed to represent Canada at the World Curling Championships since 1927. This year’s tournament takes place in friendly Brandon, Manitoba. The 2006 Olympic gold medallist Brad Gushue of Newfoundland and Labrador was skipper of last year’s championship team and the eventual winner of the World Curling title. If you want to take a crack at some rock-hurling yourself, head down the highway to the historic Granite Curling Club in Winnipeg. Known as the “St Andrews of curling” for its contribution to the sport in Canada, this historic club has produced its fair share of Canadian curling royalty, including Victor Alvin “Vic” Peters.Snowboarding and freestyle skiing: Jamboree 2019 – Quebec City, Quebec, March 2019The 2019 International Ski Federation Snowboard and Freestyle Ski World Cups will be awarded at Jamboree, Quebec City’s annual extreme winter sports festival. Big Air, Slope Style and Half-Pipe are just a few of the categories up for grabs by competitors from across the globe. Not surprisingly, there’s no shortage of outdoor concerts and parties, which are also held at nearby Stoneham, Quebec. For your own snowboarding adventures, either stay put at Stoneham, which has 135 hectares (333 acres) of skiable terrain, or drive to nearby Mont-Sainte-Anne. Ideal for black diamond experts and beginners alike, Mont-Sainte-Anne features 71 trails covering 44 miles (71km) on three different sides of the mountain.RBC Canadian Open – Ancaster, Ontario, 3-9 June 2019The Canadian Open is the premier Professional Golfers’ Association tour event in Canada, and is one of the oldest golf tournaments in North America (it dates back to 1904). The 2019 Open will be played at the historic Hamilton Golf and Country Club, in Ancaster, Ontario. Thanks to recent changes to the PGA calendar, the Canadian Open has been moved to early June, a change that is likely to attract more top-ranked golfers, some of whom had previously been unable to come north due to scheduling. If all that polite clapping at the Open has you itching to hit the links yourself, you’ll want to head north to the Muskoka Bay Club. Ranked as one of the best in Ontario, this Doug Carrick-designed course incorporates the rugged beauty of the region into the course layout and provides a distinctly Canadian golfing experience.Global Relay Canadian Road Championships – Victoria, British Columbia, June 2019Victoria, BC, will once again host the Global Relay Canadian Road Championships in June 2019. The race, which features top cyclists from across Canada, takes competitors through Canada’s “Garden City” and into nearby Metchosin, on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. For a cycling experience that’s completely different, head north to the Yukon – the land of the midnight sun. Whitehorse’s 24 Hours of Light Festival, also held in June, is the only 24-hour mountain biking race in the world where lights are illegal riders rely on natural illumination instead. Located in the heart of the Grey Mountain trail network, this exciting course is approximately 12.5km long with 277m of elevation. In keeping with the laid-back nature of Canada’s North, the event is only as competitive as you want it to be.Gold Cup and Saucer Race – Charlottetown, PEI, August 2019Old Home Week – an annual celebration of all things agricultural and more related to Canada’s tiniest province – includes the largest street parade east of Montreal, and a one-of-a-kind harness-racing competition. This late-night horse race – where the horses don’t gallop, but move at a trot, and pull a two-wheeled cart called a sulky – begins with the playing of the Island Hymn, followed by the Call to Post at exactly two minutes to midnight. And then, they’re off! If you’re not too exhausted from the previous night’s equestrian fun, there are a number of unique horseback riding opportunities for visitors along PEI’s red beaches and throughout its bucolic countryside. Try Brudenell Riding Stables, located 40 minutes outside Charlottetown on the island’s east coast.Helly Hansen Chester Race Week – Chester, Nova Scotia, August 2019The largest race of its kind in North America, The Helly Hansen Chester Race Week is an exciting, four-day, keelboat regatta that was first officially documented in 1856. Every August, more than 1,200 sailors set off from scenic Mahone Bay to compete in one of 15 fleets racing simultaneously on five different racecourses along the picturesque South Shore of Nova Scotia. Spectators can watch the races from the docks or inside the historic Chester Yacht Club. Once the boats are tied up, the party begins, with live music at the yacht club. For your own Nova Scotia sailing adventure, contact Star Charters in the nearby (and equally quaint) town of Lunenberg. Taking in a Nova Scotia sunset on the Eastern Star, their 48-foot tall ship, is an experience not to be forgotten.2019 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak Championships – Regina, Saskatchewan, 27 August-1 September 2019Located in the heart of the sunny Saskatchewan capital, Lake Wascana will welcome thousands to the 2019 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak Championships. Competitors of all ages, including Olympic and Paralympic athletes, will compete for national titles across a variety of distances over five days.

Paddlers can explore one of more than 50 spectacular routes by canoe or kayak in this world-renowned wilderness, part of the Churchill River system.Discover more of the top things to do in Canada here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bc4610f801db59adb24d9b1c96c8d39a7c2b589/0_287_4320_2594/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90468f3289cea45d1a180b83bc6bbe87","title":"headteacher leaves primary school after tests investigation","story":"Three Harris academy staff forced to leave after suspected tampering with Sats testsThe headteacher and two other staff members have left a London primary school after an internal investigation found that Sats papers had been systematically altered and missing answers added.A letter to parents with children at the Harris Primary Academy Philip Lane in Tottenham, north London, said the headteacher, Emma Penzer, the deputy head and another teacher would not be returning to the school, after the year 6 national test results were cancelled.An initial investigation by the Standards and Testing Agency (STA) in August found pupils had been given too much help while sitting their English and maths standardised tests in May this year.But the internal investigation by the Harris Federation, at the request of the STA, uncovered examples of direct tampering with test papers.Susan Head, the school’s chair of governors, told parents that the findings were a “shocking blow to the whole school community”, and were upsetting for parents and staff.“Among other findings over the course of the investigation, analysis of the papers showed that incorrect answers had been systematically crossed out and replaced with correct ones,” Head said in the letter to parents.“In the mathematics papers, the correct answers were given in places without any workings-out where they should have been present. For clarity, I would like to emphasise that the pupils themselves were not involved in any wrongdoing.”While the departure of Penzer and the other staff members was upsetting, Head told parents, “the findings of the investigation are so serious that we were left with no choice – any school presented with this evidence would need to take the same action”.The Harris Federation said its investigation included interviews with staff and former pupils, and an analysis of every test paper.“As a result, three members of staff will not be returning to work at the academy. The evidence we were presented with was so serious that this was the only appropriate course of action,” the trust said in statement.“The Harris Federation will put in place all the support needed to enable the academy to move on from this incident positively and successfully.”The school has been in the national spotlight since 2012, when Michael Gove, the then education secretary, intervened to force the primary, then known as Downhills, into academy status and join the Harris chain, despite strong opposition from parents and the local authority.Since then, the school has regularly been praised for its achievements, including 2017 Sats results that appeared to show it performing well above the national average in writing and maths.The trust said it could not comment on the employment contracts of inidual staff members. Emma Penzer and the other members of staff who have left could not be reached for comment.The action comes after Department for Education figures showed a continued rise in maladministration of key stage 2 national tests in England, with the STA investigating 466 cases involving schools last year compared with 430 in 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/938bcd6ae5a918f00a0e918588db708c206dbdfd/0_247_3060_1835/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6ba0d07e287de169ed458e32dfd0ae4","title":"meet the brighton resource goddess putting waste to good use","story":"Brighton and Hove’s first ever reuse manager, Cat Fletcher, says there’s nothing hippyish about repurposing second-hand scrapMany people think waste is smelly, rotten and useless. But Cat Fletcher, the self-styled “resource goddess”, doesn’t see it that way. In fact, she’s keen to get her hands on it. “To me there’s no such thing as waste – there’s just stuff in the wrong place,” she says. Fletcher, who runs several reuse programmes in Brighton and whose own home has “absolutely nothing new in it”, says we all need to reuse old things. And she says every business and council should employ someone like her to help them do it.Fletcher, 55, founded Freegle UK, where thousands of people give their old things away online. “It’s a lovely social activity,” she says. For example, if you’re giving away a tennis racquet you might meet someone else who plays tennis. She also built the award-winning Waste House, along with architect Duncan Baker-Brown, on the University of Brighton’s campus in 2014. The house is filled with repurposed rubbish, such as old duvets, cut-off jeans and CDs. And it looks surprisingly stylish, too.On top of that, Fletcher is the first reuse manager for Brighton and Hove city council, meaning she is called in during building renovations to sift through leftover scraps and redistribute them to local businesses and charities.The work is “never-ending” because there’s “too much stuff in the world”, Fletcher says. We throw away at least 3.5m tons of plastic and other solid waste a day, World Bank research shows. And the urgent need to better manage our waste was addressed last month by the Waste to Wealth summit, developed by the Prince of Wales.For Fletcher, waste has always been a passion. A former psychiatric nurse, she moved to the UK at the age of 29, after marrying a man from Brighton. When she arrived in Britain, Fletcher was “horrified” that there was no kerbside recycling. Taking matters into her own hands, she drove around in a van, picking up empty bottles and cans from her new friends and neighbours every week. “They thought I was this wacky girl from Australia,” she says. “But they indulged me.”As teenagers, her son and twin daughters found her love of waste annoying, but travelling changed their minds. “They’d be in paradise in Vietnam or somewhere and they saw these beautiful pristine landscapes covered in plastic,” she says.Attitudes towards waste have started to change. Last year, David Attenborough called for the world to cut back on its use of plastic in order to protect oceans. His Blue Planet series showed millions of viewers the horrific damage plastics are doing to marine wildlife.Fletcher is optimistic we can change our attitudes towards other rubbish, and get people to make better use of it. When the Waste House was first built four years ago people thought it was “a bit novel and a bit weird”, but now she thinks they are starting to get it.Despite the progress, there’s still much more we can do with our rubbish. “There’s only so many resources in the world and we’ve used so many of them already,” Fletcher says. “This isn’t about being a hippy. It’s logical – we need to reuse our stuff.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7536adf76b6e7bfb5f29f69dace7270251bd40/0_207_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee8b1618176d55f5432e420a9d70ed7","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

But will cinema’s tedious mining of old material ever stop?With the news that a film based on the songs of Prince is in the works, Hollywood is about to write another enthralling chapter in the ongoing saga that sees it plunder any recognisable brand for a new movie. Reports have emerged that “Universal Pictures has picked up the rights to a number of classic songs that will form the basis of a fictional big-screen musical.” We go on to learn that producers and execs are aiming for “the style of Mamma Mia!”.The first aspect requiring examination here is the trend of film-makers and TV creatives ransacking existing IP – any dust-covered song or back catalogue or Wikipedia entry – in order to churn out something that stands a statistically better chance of turning a buck than an original story. Nobody could wholly blame failure-wary execs for plumping for output whose popularity is proven (Prince has sold more than a 100m records worldwide) – yet the prevailing trend for spinning old faves into new formats has something a little tiresome to it. In the last 10 days alone we’ve had news of a Great Gatsby prequel and of a Netflix series based on the work of Roald Dahl, “building out an imaginative story universe that expands far beyond the pages of the books”. The comparison with Dahl is an apt one, since it’s the writer’s heirs rather than the man himself who inked the deal. Prince was famously proprietorial towards his music: he consistently removed his songs from YouTube, forbade Spotify from playing them and didn’t even grant fair use to Weird Al Yankovic. Now his estate – consisting of his six siblings – finds itself in possession of this goldmine, and they seem to be a lot less reticent, so to the many cash-spinning releases since his death, we can now add a jukebox musical.It’s a genre that has traditionally had a rough time of it on screen. Mamma Mia! did the business at the box office but went down infamously badly with critics. (“The legal definition of torture has been much aired in recent years, and I take Mamma Mia! to be a useful contribution to that debate,” wrote the New Yorker’s Anthony Lane.) Other ventures include Julie Taymor’s Across the Universe, a flop based on the Beatles’ back catalogue, and Clint Eastwood’s Jersey Boys.Much of these confections’ horror lies in the sort of necessarily baggy story that can accommodate a great number of wildly different songs. The Queen stage musical, We Will Rock You, centred on Galileo and Scaramouche, two rebels who take on a villain called the Killer Queen in a mission that involves them going to the Seven Seas of Rhye. What, then, to expect of a Prince musical?Prince’s evocative and lascivious songs could tell any number of stories, but it’s probably fair to say the film won’t centre on Darling Nikki, the sex fiend whom the singer meets “masturbating with a magazine” in a hotel lobby. At best we might be granted a montage scene set to Gett Off, although 23 positions could be a lot to get through in four minutes. The point is that Prince’s music is daring, spiky and kinky, and it might be hard to tease out a coherent narrative from songs as different as Raspberry Beret and I Would Die 4 U. It’s also likely that the queer edges of Prince’s music might get blunted by this type of endeavour – although if the film features a take on When You Were Mine with a male-male-female threesome in it I will be the first to doff my cap.Whether Prince’s musical brilliance – which is of a different ilk to that of Abba or the Beatles – can be preserved in this film is another question entirely. In the meantime, anybody worried for the state of cinema can draw some gallows humour from the thought of a team of frazzled writers sweating their way through Prince’s songbook to sift out potential storylines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c28500d70bbd292683f87f0a89245a03953c8bd/0_312_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad31b8e5c00589a01d999572bab9dccd","title":"manchester united top four miracle mourinho","story":"José Mourinho refuses to believe his relationship with Manchester United’s players is partly to blame for the team’s struggles this season and insisted the only way that could be a factor is if they were “dishonest” footballers.United are languishing in seventh place, with a negative goal difference, after successive draws against Crystal Palace and Southampton, meaning the 20-times league champions are 19 points behind Manchester City at the top of the table and eight adrift of the Champions League places.Three days after allegedly calling Paul Pogba a “virus” in a dressing-room outburst at Southampton, Mourinho would not be drawn on their troubled relationship but, in a more controlled exchange at his latest press conference, he insisted he did not follow the theory that various players were doing badly because they disliked the manager.“I don’t understand that story,” Mourinho said. “If you think a player only plays, in your words, when he is behind the manager, what I have to call these players – or in this case, what you are calling them – is dishonest.“A football player is paid – and very well paid – to be a professional. What is that? It is to train every day to his limits, to play every game to his limits, to behave socially according to the nature of his job, to respect the millions of fans around the world and to respect the hierarchies of the club.“If a player doesn’t do that, it is one thing is to perform well and not so well, another thing is to be a professional. If you say a player plays well or badly because of how good a manager is, you are calling the player dishonest.”As ever with Mourinho, the key was to work out the exact point he was trying to make and, in this case, it felt conspicuously like another attempt to absolve himself of blame for their predicament, while possibly getting a message to Pogba, the subject of many questions. Mourinho may also be scoring a few points at the expense of the television pundits, including many former United players, he has come to resent because of their criticisms.“Because you are a journalist and not a professional player, I understand your question,” Mourinho said. “But when pundits, who were professional players, say ‘this player is not playing for the manager’, did they do that when they were players? Were they dishonest players? If they were, they shouldn’t be in front of a camera speaking to millions of people.When it was pointed out an employee’s work could be adversely affected in various walks of life if that person did not get on with the people at the top, Mourinho told the journalist asking the question: “So you have only one solution.

The Tottenham manager offered his view after being told of how Arsenal had gloried in their 4-2 derby victory over his team on Sunday.Bernd Leno uploaded a picture of the team celebrating in the dressing room Aaron Ramsey used the hashtag #northlondonisred and Sokratis Papastathopoulos shared a photograph of himself standing over Harry Kane.Pochettino was careful not to criticise Arsenal, making the point that he was talking purely about his own mentality, and he preferred to take his rival’s celebrations as a compliment a sign that Spurs were a scalp worth having. Pochettino had spoken last week of the importance of the humility that his players had shown after their 3-1 win over Chelsea the previous Saturday.“Personally, I don’t like,” Pochettino said about dressing-room selfies. “If you win a trophy, like I did when I was a player, it is a moment to celebrate. This is my mentality. I don’t want to say it’s right or wrong. I love to celebrate in private and not make it public. If you win, celebrate and show the fans you are happy – but when you win a trophy, when you win something special.To further illustrate his point, Pochettino told a story from Anfield, where Tottenham’s chief scout, Steve Hitchin, had been at the derby between Liverpool and Everton, which kicked off shortly after the Arsenal-Spurs game finished. “Steve was watching our game before and when Arsenal scored the third goal, all the Liverpool fans celebrated, like Arsenal celebrated afterwards,” Pochettino said. “It’s clear we are doing something good. That respect – I love it. I love it when the people celebrate when they beat you. I don’t like it when the people don’t celebrate because it’s normal to beat Tottenham.”Pochettino’s anecdote prompted a question – what was the club’s chief scout doing at the Merseyside derby? “Be careful,” he replied, with a smile. “There is maybe a big surprise in January.”Pochettino is preparing for Wednesday’s visit of Southampton, his former club, who will be under the caretaker charge of Kelvin Davis, his one-time captain. Danny Rose, who is fit again after a groin injury, is in line for his first start since 6 October. Kieran Trippier is also fit after groin trouble.

But a transcript of his plea hearing in a Brooklyn federal court was only released on Tuesday with the former official expected to be sentenced this week.The redacted transcript reveals that Salguero told the court he was approached by an inidual in 2010 who offered him “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in exchange for his vote. Salguero said he was approached on a flight from Mexico to Guatemala by an inidual whose name is also redacted in the transcript. Salguero said he met with the unnamed person multiple times after their first encounter to discuss the bribe.The transcript redacts the name of the bid Salguero was told to vote for and the name of another inidual, based in Italy, who had offered to provide the cash.The 2018 World Cup was eventually hosted by Russia following a 2010 vote at Fifa’s headquarters in Zurich. The results were mired with controversy following allegations of corruption in both Russia’s 2018 bid and Qatar’s successful bid for the 2022 tournament. Russia, England and joint bids from the Netherlands and Belgium, and Portugal and Spain were considered for the 2018 World Cup.According to the newly released transcript, Salguero told the court in 2016 that although he voted for the bid he was told to, he never received the money and did not make a trip to Italy as was suggested by the unnamed inidual offering the bribe.Over 40 iniduals and entities were indicted as part of the the US Justice Department’s investigation into Fifa with over two dozen pleading guilty.

Luckily for Pep Guardiola the luxury of rotation comes easily to a squad replete with talent. Like a member of the Magic Circle performing tricks with a subtle sleight of hand, six of the starting selection that cantered past Bournemouth on Saturday moved out of the picture, replaced by a new set at Watford. Now you see Raheem Sterling, Aymeric Laporte and Ilkay Gündogan. Now you don’t. Now you see Vincent Kompany, David Silva and Riyad Mahrez instead. See what he did there?City being City, half a team’s worth of switches led to no great discernible change in the overall pattern of play, collective confidence and end result.That was certainly the case for the vast majority of this match. Dominant, controlling, enjoying long stretches of comfortable possession, two smartly worked goals from the purposeful Leroy Sané and Mahrez created a platform for a seemingly inevitable victory. So it was a shock for the story to produce a late twist, to go off at a very unexpected tangent.Abdoulaye Doucouré bundled in an 85th-minute goal and City ended the match sucked into a pressure situation. Defending set pieces, all hands to the pump, nerves on edge, it was a reminder of how quickly, and how dangerously, control can evaporate.While not exactly welcoming that reminder, Guardiola did use the moment to press home the message to his players. “We spoke now in the locker room. We have to learn what happened in last 25 minutes. Never you can forget to play,” he said.“We lost a little bit our control. We suffered. The normal process is to win and improve. In general, I am satisfied. We will talk, we will visualise, if you let opponent play in last few minutes you can face problems.”Ultimately, though, City returned to Manchester with three more points, and reimposed a five-point lead at the head of the Premier League, reloading the pressure on the chasers. They inflicted a fourth home defeat from their past five games here for Watford, which is a worry for Javi Gracia, but if there is ever a fixture to shrug and accept some punishment, then this is it.Ben Foster must have suspected he would be in for a busy evening and he began in inspired form. Watford’s keeper showed wolfish persistence to produce a miraculous triple save in the 18th minute. City looked odds on to score when Kompany slipped an inviting pass for Mahrez, whose efforts were quickly followed up by Bernardo Silva and David Silva.Foiled three times in a matter of seconds, City might have perhaps spent half a second wondering whether it might be one of those almost impossibly rare nights.Watford found moments to show a flicker of ambition. Roberto Pereyra jinked into position and swept in a shot. On the half-hour, Doucouré flicked the ball over his head and it arced perfectly into Troy Deeney’s path. The crowd gasped. The forward steered his shot straight and Ederson grabbed hold of it.The moment passed and City began pressing again. Five minutes before half-time, Watford’s resistance was broken in uncommon fashion by Sané. Mahrez spotted the German on the far side and as the ball was floated over he improvised to deal with the height it arrived at in the most efficient manner by sending it past Foster with a jut of cushioned chest control.City extended their lead just after the break and the goal was symbolic of how they are able to force errors in opponents who look as if they are finding it hard to breathe when the blue shirts start to press.Watford had a throw in their own defensive third and City simply gobbled it up. David Silva threaded the ball to Gabriel Jesus, whose cross was guided past Foster by Mahrez.Some of the footwork on display from Sané, David Silva and Mahrez was breathtaking. There was almost sympathy for Jesus, whose low confidence and spurning of chances in front of goal really stood out. But 2-0 it stayed, which gave Watford that glimmer of a late recovery.City move on to Stamford Bridge on Saturday, a fixture Guardiola describes as complicated, but he is happy to concentrate on matches at a time when Uefa are investigating the club’s business activities in the wake of the Football Leaks allegations. “Uefa is doing what it is doing,” he said. “If they find something the club will make a statement. I trust a lot in our club, our organisation. If something is wrong they are going to tell us.”He finds it easier to focus on the tricks he is expected to pull off on the pitch. “Of course. It is too easy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d09d4808e1936e1bd5b4816aeb177a8488815719/0_86_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=040568907efae35c8b010e5a97845663","title":"martin solveig twerk ballon dor ada hegerberg","story":"After his embarrassing question to Ada Hegerberg marred Monday’s Ballon d’Or ceremony in Paris, the French DJ didn’t pass up the chance to keep on diggingEnormous commiserations to French DJ Martin Solveig, the latest person to be filmed doing something in public that apparently doesn’t reflect who he is. The this-is-not-who-I-am defence gets a lot of run-outs these days, as cameraphones catch non-racist people being racist on buses, non-homophobic people screaming abuse at gay people outside a nightclub, or any of the other variants that increasingly adorn the age. The point is: this is not who they are.Very occasionally, the person saying the thing is saying it on a stage, in front of a large audience and multiple television cameras, and is deploying remarks they have worked out in advance. But this, too, is not who those people are.By way of a recap, let’s journey to Monday night’s Ballon d’Or award ceremony in Paris. As presenter, Solveig was on stage when Lyon’s and Norway’s Ada Hegerberg won the inaugural women’s Ballon d’Or. (Luka Modric picked up the men’s award, while Kylian Mbappé was honoured with a new under-21s prize, the Kopa Trophy.) Alas, no sooner had Hegerberg picked up the trophy than Solveig asked her if she could twerk. When she replied “no” and turned away from the podium, Solveig was shown laughing.I would say that he engaged in this skit for reasons best known to himself – except it seems Martin doesn’t actually know the reasons why he did this. Indeed, they are not even dimly grasped by him.The aforementioned reasons did appear known to Mbappé, who was shown in a cutaway shot wearing an expression we’ll call straight-to-GIF. And they were certainly known to Andy Murray, who promptly took to social media to declare: “Another example of the ridiculous sexism that still exists in sport. Why do women still have to put up with that shit? ... And to everyone who thinks people are overreacting and it was just a joke… It wasn’t. I’ve been involved in sport my whole life and the level of sexism is unreal.”For her part, Hegerberg got through it graciously, though wearing the unmistakable expression of a woman realising that it is somehow going to be on her to manage the situation in a way that causes as few ripples as possible. It won’t have been pleasant having to do this even at one of the very highest points of her professional career so far, but it certainly won’t have been unfamiliar. Not making dickheads feel like dickheads is one of the earliest ingrained lessons.As for Solveig, he has apologised “to anyone who may have been offended”, which as everyone knows is the boilerplate non-apology. He went on to say: “People who have followed me for 20 years know how respectful I am especially with women.”That “especially” is a bit of a tell. Why would you be any more respectful with women than with men, unless you thought there was something patronisably different about them? There was a classic Tom Cruise interview where the star was banging on about how he really respected women, and when the interviewer asked him what in particular he respected about them, he replied: “They smell good. They look pretty. I love them. I do.”Yup, “I especially respect women” is a close relative of “I love women” – that weirdo blanket statement embraced by men who prefer to homogenise everyone who shares the same pronoun. Guys, how can you love the entire classification “women”? Loads of women are horrendous, same as loads of men are. If you Google celebrities saying “I love women”, you always get some Mel Gibson interview from a couple of years after he called a female cop “sugartits”, or a Chris Brown interview from a few months after he was arrested for beating up his then-girlfriend, Rihanna. Or a Silvio Berlusconi interview from basically any time. Pro tip: guys in or out of the public eye who say: “I love women,” always turn out bad, or, more usually, have already done so.As for the organisers, they suggested a landmark had been reached with the first ever Ballon d’Or Féminin. But with a sexism controversy breaking out at the very moment of presentation, perhaps the real takeout is how far there is left to go.As predicted, the annual Sports Personality of the Year award row has rolled round again – a tradition as sacred as November’s Premier League poppy row, and as moving as the rows about why England players didn’t visit a first world war memorial when they had a game within 100 miles of it.Making an incredible comeback to the Spoty row is Tyson Fury, who last starred in one in 2015, when 130,000 signed a petition demanding he be removed from the shortlist. This year, the opposite sort of outrage is being worked up, with suggestions that because the panel of experts who decided the Spoty shortlist met in November, they will not have been able to take Fury’s sensational weekend draw against Deontay Wilder into account.According to the BBC’s published terms and conditions for Spoty: “The Panel have the right to amend elements of this or other awards … provided such changes remain within the spirit of the award.”So it’s only a matter of time before you spot your first “will of the people”, and people start demanding the BBC release the Spoty legal advice. All the worst timelines of public life are converging this December, and you should stockpile eggnog accordingly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd9d13090ac98c49c00a6379393a4f1075aa3708/69_133_3780_2268/master/3780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1588ea7af2e6615938ab91f731bf0776","title":"sol campbell looks part macclesfield manager newcastle u21 checkatrade trophy","story":"Sol Campbell’s deep interest in interior design is said to incorporate a penchant for symmetry, so it seemed thoroughly appropriate the former England centre-half began his managerial career where his playing days ended.St James’ Park witnessed his final, half-fit hurrahs and more than seven years on it staged his debut in the technical area as Macclesfield took Newcastle’s Under-21s to a penalty shootout in round two of the Checkatrade Trophy. With the score 1-1 after 90 minutes, League Two’s bottom side lost 5-3 on penalties.“We played extremely well in patches,” said an animated Campbell who, as an 18-year-old, made his full debut here for Tottenham. “There’s lots of good positives. We’ve got a fight on our hands but I’m enjoying it and the guys are responding. They just need to start seeing the pictures earlier. And, no it’s not a culture shock for me. I get it.”Although Campbell made only eight appearances for Newcastle during an injury-hit, retirement-prefacing, £35,000-a-week 2010-11 campaign his wife, the designer Fiona Barratt, is from the city and until recently the couple owned a country pile in Northumberland.Such personal history probably made the 44-year-old’s latest return to Tyneside feel something of a homecoming and he certainly looked at ease on the touchline.Before kick-off he spent time standing, statuesque, on the sidelines gazing at the imposing, near-empty terraces as a lone photographer snapped away.After seven years of forlorn football job hunting – even if he applied for only 15 posts – it must have felt a special moment. Campbell was finally making a belated, eagerly awaited, managerial bow, albeit in front of a crowd of 1,126.His appointment has been met by a mix of optimism, scepticism and sheer curiosity. In expanding the small band of BAME – black, Asian, minority ethnic – managers working in England’s professional game to eight, he offers hope to other non-white coaches but he is not your typical role model.If many BAME coaches have clearly been overlooked unfairly, it is Campbell’s slightly left-field personality rather than his skin colour that has arguably most hindered his progress.Set against the 73 England caps and Spurs and Arsenal glory days was the slightly wacky notion of becoming London’s Conservative mayor and his claim to being “one of the greatest minds in football”.Some coaching acquaintances took fright at his enthusiasm for discussing the subtleties of paint shades and high-end decor rather than concentrating purely on shadow play and swift transitions but surely everyone needs a hinterland?Having defied near-freezing temperatures with a standard issue, navy blue, hooded, SC-embossed anorak he initially chewed a pen contemplatively, as the 6ft 5in Nathan Blissett – Luther’s nephew – struggled against Newcastle’s defence.His assessment complete, Campbell began pointing fingers and variously bellowing: “Open up”, “push in” and “second ball” as his team responded by trying to build from the back and using the full width of the pitch. “You can still play football at this level,’ he said.Sure enough, Koby Arthur sporadically menaced but Macclesfield still fell behind to Elias Sørensen’s 18th goal of the season.As Ben Dawson – in his 12th month covering for the suspended Peter Beardsley – celebrated, a half‑time homily was perhaps forming in Campbell’s head his players certainly enjoyed increased second-half possession and equalised after Scott Wilson lifted a shot over Nathan Harker.“Penalties are always a lottery,” he said. “But the guys had worked their socks off.”Dawson does not believe such application was coincidental. “Macclesfield looked well organised and were clearly listening to Sol’s instructions,” said an impressed Newcastle coach. “He’s going to be fine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c9b60c0ff2ccab7dcb4b48d53e40da26e4d5555/58_25_4115_2468/master/4115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=852c05e4d68d2d5fe35893a03ea61b7c","title":"esa pekka salonen conductor to leave philharmonia orchestra","story":"Award-winning orchestra will begin search for a sixth principal conductor ahead of Finn’s departure in 2021The Philharmonia Orchestra has announced that Esa-Pekka Salonen is to step down from his role as principal conductor and artistic advisor at the end of the 2020-2021 season. The 60-year-old Finland-born conductor and composer has been with the London orchestra since 2008, when he took over from Christoph von Dohnányi. His successor – who has not yet been announced – will be only the sixth principal conductor in the orchestra’s 75-year history.“The Philharmonia is a group that juxtaposes world-class talent and star-power with an ease of musical communication, personal warmth, risk-taking and always good humour,” said Salonen. “I do not say lightly that they are family, and I am honoured to be a part of what will be their fantastic future.”Under his leadership, the orchestra has raised its profile and broadened its repertoire, excelling in early 20th-century music. It has also been at the forefront of imaginative and inclusive digital projects – its award-winning immersive installations, Re-Rite and Universe of Sound, gave audiences the opportunity to explore an orchestra section by section and experience music from a player’s point of view. More recently, virtual reality projects allowed those donning the goggles to get to the very heart of the orchestra and encounter symphonic music as if sitting under Salonen’s nose.’s classical critic Andrew Clements picked the Philharmonia’s Stravinsky series as one of his top musical events of 2016: “It stood out for its freshness and originality. Some of Stravinsky’s greatest and most neglected masterpieces were included, often in ingenious concert stagings, and if some of those did not work quite as convincingly as they might have done, the musical performances under Salonen were always of the highest quality.”“Salonen set very high standards for the orchestra,” said the ’s Martin Kettle. “He’s a terrific orchestral trainer and a brilliantly clear conductor in the Boulez tradition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/909ed19610b6b4fa645e57ef8027363ef17dd8ab/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90237ba1b83c5e0a94a89398e554788f","title":"honduras a dam and the of berta caceres","story":"Seven men have been convicted of the murder of an award-winning environmental activist in Honduras.

The prime minister can’t keep pushing parliament away or avoiding responsible scrutiny,” he said.MPs had already voted down a government compromise, which would have referred the dispute to parliament’s privileges committee, delaying it until after next week’s crunch vote on May’s deal.With the prime minister still waiting to open the formal debate, MPs then inflicted a third defeat, passing a cross-party amendment tabled by MPs including Dominic Grieve aimed at strengthening the hand of parliament if the deal is voted down.Backers of a softer Brexit – or a second referendum on May’s deal – cheered the move, which they hope will allow them to demonstrate parliament’s support for alternatives to May’s approach.Grieve said: “MPs are tonight starting the process of taking back control. No longer must the will of parliament – reflecting the will of the people – be diminished. Parliament must now take back control and then give the final decision back to the public because, in the end, only the people can sort this out.”Grieve’s amendment was supported by the Democratic Unionist party and by 26 Tory rebels, including several former cabinet ministers, some of them erstwhile loyalists, such as Damian Green and Michael Fallon. The government lost by 321 votes to 299.Asked if May still commanded a majority in parliament, a No 10 source said: “Everybody knows the parliamentary arithmetic but during the course of this administration, we have won the overwhelming majority of the votes taking place.”May went on to open the debate with a defiant speech, which some at Westminster said sounded like a first draft of her own political obituary, with the future of her government in doubt.“I have spent nearly two years negotiating this deal. I have lost valued colleagues along the way. And faced fierce criticism from all sides,” she said.“If I had banged the table, walked out of the room and at the end of the process delivered the very same deal that is before us today, some might say I had done a better job. But I didn’t play to the gallery, I focused on getting a deal that honours the referendum and sets us on course for a bright future – and I did so through painstaking hard work.”Doggedly vowing to plough on with her controversial EU deal, the prime minister insisted there was no alternative that could command public support – and warned that rejecting it would be risky. “This argument has gone on long enough, it is corrosive to our politics and life depends on compromise,” she said.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, replying to the prime minister, dismissed the political declaration accompanying the 585-page withdrawal agreement as “a very vague wish list.”“We still don’t know what our long-term relationship with Europe would look like and that’s why so many MPs across parliament are not willing to vote for this blindfold Brexit and take a leap in the dark about Britain’s future,” he said.May faced a series of hostile interventions from her own side, with the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who resigned in protest at her deal in July, calling it “a national humiliation, that makes a mockery of Brexit”.“We are going to be rule-takers we are going to be a de facto colony – and out of sheer funk we are ensuring we will never, ever be able to take advantage of the freedoms we should have won through Brexit,” he warned.Brexiters remained defiant, despite the passage of the Grieve amendment. The former Department for Exiting the EU minister Steve Baker, who vainly sought to spearhead a no confidence motion against May last month, insisted motions passed by MPs in the wake of the deal being rejected could not be binding.Privately, pro-Brexit sources suggested they would be content if May’s deal is rejected by a margin of at least 50 votes.While the government opposed the Grieve amendment, Downing Street hopes it will focus the minds of pro-Brexit MPs, by increasing the likelihood that the defeat of May’s deal next week would result in a fresh referendum. With just a week to go before Tuesday’s vote, May is expected to spend time meeting colleagues inidually in a bid to win them over.The government is also making fresh efforts to woo the DUP by offering further reassurances over access to the mainland’s market if the prime minister’s deal is voted through.“We are talking about unilateral commitments we can give in the House of Commons to provide reassurance in relation to providing access to the GB market,” a Downing Street source said.Earlier, as Labour MPs heard they had defeated the government in the contempt motion, a loud cheer went up, with one opposition backbencher shouting: “Beginning of the end!”The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, had argued that the public interest did not permit the publication of the legal advice and instead published a summary and took questions in the House of Commons on Monday.During the debate, Starmer said the government was “wilfully refusing” to comply with a binding order to release the legal advice on its Brexit deal, putting it in contempt of parliament.Downing Street sources later sought to clarify reports that May would publish the legal advice on Wednesday, indicating that while the government will respond to the contempt vote, it might not publish the advice within 24 hours. “The legal advice will be published. The government will respond tomorrow,” one said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aa4932b08408fb2705a2e3e8bd20e9874337fb7/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e742d243fd1cca2b215d3139b4453d8a","title":"what happens next if theresa mays brexit deal is voted down","story":"We examine the possible scenarios, from a snap election to a second referendumAfter taking her Brexit deal on a round-Britain roadshow last week, Theresa May is spending much of the next few days holding face-to-face meetings with her MPs in an attempt to persuade them to support it in the meaningful vote on 11 December.But with the parliamentary arithmetic looking bleak, just about everyone in Westminster is busy looking beyond next Tuesday – and puzzling over what will happen next.If the deal is voted down as anticipated, there are at least seven possible scenarios:While no one in Downing Street wants to countenance it openly, the EU Withdrawal Act – as amended by MPs – gives Theresa May up to 21 days to return to parliament and set out what she plans to do next.She could come back to parliament and say she will seek to renegotiate the backstop – though No 10 insists that would be impossible – or even pivot towards a different kind of Brexit, perhaps with a permanent customs union as Labour is calling for.May could also ask for an extension to article 50, the strictly time-limited EU exit procedure, in order to allow her to renegotiate, though that would require the consent of all 27 other EU member states.Rumours have been swirling around Westminster for several weeks now, suggesting Downing Street could choose to take a dramatic gamble and appeal to the public, over the heads of squabbling MPs, to back the prime minister’s deal.Of course, it did not go too well the last time she asked voters to give her a fresh Brexit mandate, last year, but internal polling suggests there is considerable personal sympathy for the embattled prime minister. If she won, she could press ahead with her deal.Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, she would need a two-thirds majority to trigger a general election, but last year’s experience suggested that is not an insurmountable barrier – and Labour is champing at the bit.Parliament must be dissolved at least 25 working days before a general election can be held, so any election would probably take place in late January.The prime minister has been so intimately associated with the shape of this Brexit deal, with its focus on controlling migration and extricating Britain from the scope of the European court of justice, that a heavy defeat could fatally undermine her already dented authority.Particularly if the defeat is a hefty one, she may decide she cannot be the person to make the next move – or her cabinet may decide for her.The Conservatives would then need to hold a hasty leadership contest, the outcome of which could have a profound impact on the shape of Brexit.If May opts to try to cling to office after a thumping defeat in the meaningful vote – and her cabinet does not show her the door by threatening to resign en masse – she could face a vote of no confidence in her leadership.The European Research Group of Brexiters failed to muster the 48 names necessary to trigger such a vote last month, but following a defeat, particularly if May appears unwilling to change course, many more could decide to join them.Losing the vote would prompt a leadership contest, in which May could not stand, and her successor would face the job of resurrecting Brexit with the 29 March deadline fast approaching.Labour’s priority is to try to secure a general election, to allow Jeremy Corbyn to take over and send Sir Keir Starmer to negotiate with Brussels.In the days following the vote, Labour could table a vote of no confidence in the government. May could still win it, but not without the support of the DUP, which is deeply dissatisfied with her approach to Brexit.If the government loses, Corbyn would have a fortnight in which to try to assemble a viable governing majority, by teaming up with other parties. If he was unable to do so – which would appear likely – a general election would be called.Another outlandish possibility being mooted by some at Westminster is that a time-limited, cross-party “government of national unity” could emerge at this point, perhaps around the idea of a Norway-style Brexit.Dominic Grieve and his allies have fought to ensure that whichever motion is brought back to parliament by the government, once the vote has failed, can be amended.In theory at least, that could allow MPs to test the backing of MPs for a menu of different options, including a harder or a softer Brexit.Even if a majority emerged for an alternative approach, it is unclear whether such a motion would be formally binding on the government. But proponents of this approach argue that it would have political bite, as a statement of the collective will of the House of Commons.Rebel MPs who support a “people’s vote” are determined to try to use any parliamentary tactics they can to force the government to take its Brexit deal to the public in another referendum.Crucially, while several on the Labour frontbench remain deeply sceptical about the idea, its membership is overwhelmingly in favour of overturning Brexit, and leading figures including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have begun to make warmer noises about it.It remains unclear whether there is time for a referendum to be held before the March deadline and an extension of article 50 would probably be necessary.But if parliament appears deadlocked, passing the question back to the public could look increasingly appealing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8fc26ef9e5699c05c36ee205235a2e65816d377/0_90_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02af2277c53cd9909609dda8c300744c","title":"physicist albert einstein god letter reflecting on religion up for auction christies","story":"Missive that calls the Bible ‘a collection of primitive legends’ was expected to fetch only half that muchA handwritten missive by Albert Einstein known as the “God letter” fetched almost $3m at auction on Tuesday.Christie’s auction house in New York stated on Tuesday afternoon that the letter, including the buyer’s premium, fetched $2.89m under the hammer. That was almost twice the expected amount.The one-and-a-half-page letter, written in 1954 in German and addressed to the philosopher Eric Gutkind, contains reflections on God, the Bible and Judaism.Einstein says: “The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive, legends which are nevertheless pretty childish.”The sentence has been hailed as evidence that the physicist, one of the 20th century’s most esteemed thinkers, was an atheist. But Einstein at times said he was not an atheist, and resented being labelled as one.In the letter – being auctioned at Christie’s in New York on Tuesday – Einstein, a Jew, also articulates his disenchantment with Judaism. “For me the Jewish religion like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people,” he wrote.“As far as my experience goes, they are no better than other human groups, although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power. Otherwise I cannot see anything ‘chosen’ about them.”The letter was written in response to a book by Gutkind, called Choose Life: The Biblical Call to Revolt.The letter had been held among Gutkin’s papers, but it came up for auction in London in 2008. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins was beaten in bidding that ended at £170,000.Acknowledging his disappointment in failing to secure the item, Dawkins said: “This letter was about something very important to Einstein, I suspect.”According to Einstein: A Life, a biography published in 1996, he was devoutly religious as a child. But at the age of 13, he “abandoned his uncritical religious fervour, feeling he had been deceived into believing lies”.He said he believed in “Spinoza’s God” – referring to Baruch Spinoza, a 17th-century Dutch thinker – “who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind”.On another occasion, he criticised “fanatical atheists whose intolerance is of the same kind as the intolerance of the religious fanatics”.Nick Spencer, a senior fellow at the Christian thinktank Theos, said: “Einstein offers scant consolation to either party in this debate. His cosmic religion and distant deistic God fits neither the agenda of religious believers or that of tribal atheists.“As so often during his life, he refused and disturbed the accepted categories. We do the great physicist a disservice when we go to him to legitimise our belief in God, or in his absence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ae7c6234d0f6224fd06fb63c79d806117bd4995/0_168_4050_2430/master/4050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f1de1fc346b875f80f4882dc042cebe","title":"talking horses can teruntum star bag the big prize at lingfield","story":"Musselburgh racecourse has received an important vote of confidence from trainer Philip Hobbs after four horses died during a single meeting on Monday. Racing’s ruling body is to study the deaths in case there was a common risk factor but Hobbs, whose Kensukes Kingdom suffered a fatal leg injury in winning the first race, said he had no complaints about the track.“The course was fine,” Hobbs said. “It was just one of those things, unlucky and upsetting for staff and owners.”Kensukes Kingdom was a young horse with lots of potential having his very first run over hurdles. He coped well with the obstacles themselves but was lame soon after passing the post. His tendon injury was initially thought to be survivable but proved more serious.Two other horses appeared to sustain fatal leg injuries mid-race. Sierra Oscar was pulled up soon after the third-last in another hurdle race, while Leather Belly lost his action so badly that he fell during the bumper race, a race in which no obstacles are jumped.Smart Ruler collapsed in the latter stages of a handicap hurdle, having led 100 yards earlier. His trainer, Jimmy Moffat, believes the horse suffered a heart attack and backed up Hobbs in saying there was nothing wrong with the track.However, four deaths from only 44 runners caused the British Horseracing Authority to take a closer look. “The incidents at Musselburgh were extremely distressing for everyone involved,” it said in a statement. “Work will now be undertaken to identify if there are any risk factors at the course or with the horses that might have contributed to these incidents. The BHA’s inspector of courses will be visiting Musselburgh in the coming days to carry out a full inspection.“Some of the horses are also being sent for post-mortems to establish more information, including for one of the horses whose death seems to relate to a sudden collapse.”A detailed BHA review of six deaths at March’s Cheltenham Festival is expected to result in a final report next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bcafb31972aced2de66089d691e1a972d1cd1d8/0_0_4055_2433/master/4055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a43b37f1b655bc9958dac8deca58ef4","title":"apple macbook air review the new default mac","story":"A beautiful, crisp display, good performance and modern ports rejuvenate a classicApple has finally given the MacBook Air the update fans have been craving for the last three years: new processors and a vastly improved Retina display. But is this the new Mac laptop for most people or has it lost some of the desirability and shine while stagnating since 2015?When closed, the new MacBook Air looks pretty much the same as the old one. The aluminium frame is still wedge-shaped. It still has the cut-out in the deck to lift the screen and still has the Apple logo emblazoned on the lid, even if it is now metallic and shiny rather than being light-up opaque plastic.But side by side it is clear this is a smaller, more modern Mac shrunk in both width and length, but not in height, fitting exactly into the footprint of the current 13in MacBook Pro. Gone, too, are the old selection of ports from the Air, reduced to only two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and one headphone socket. USB-C is the industry standard port of the moment, with Thunderbolt 3 adding much greater capacity and future proofing, but the lack of an SD card reader is disappointing.Open it up and essentially what you are looking at is the screen and deck of a MacBook Pro without Touch Bar. Gone are the large grey bezels around the 13.3in screen from the Air, replaced with thinner black borders as used on other Apple laptops.The MacBook Air has Apple’s third-generation butterfly keyboard, a large force-touch trackpad and speakers drilled into either side. In the top right is the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, which is noticeably faster than Apple’s previous iterations, but instead of a Touch Bar you have regular F keys. While the Touch Bar can be useful, many don’t like it and most will probably be happy the MacBook Air does not have it.Some will love the keyboard, some will hate it because it is still pretty clicky with minimal key travel. It isn’t my favourite keyboard on a laptop but it is crisp and responsive and I have no problem typing for long periods of time on it. Everyone should love the trackpad, however, which is the best in the business. It is big, smooth, responsive and totally solid, despite the feeling of motion when you push down on it provided by the Taptic Engine haptic motor below it.Build quality is top notch, with no noticeable give or flex in any part of the machine. Weighing 1.25kg, the Air is about the same as rivals such as Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 2 and is slim enough that you don’t really notice it in a backpack. But it is noticeably heavier than the 921g 12in MacBook or 770g Surface Pro 6 (1.08kg with keyboard attached). At its thickest part it is also 0.7mm thicker than the MacBook Pro.The MacBook Air as tested had 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.The MacBook Air has a relatively unusual mix of hardware for 2018. It only has one choice of processor, an eighth-generation Intel Core i5 processor, but it isn’t the same quad-core U-series processor available in the 13in MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, instead it is a dual-core Y-series chip.While the fine points of processor names are probably lost on most Mac buyers, Y-series chips are lower power in performance and energy consumption than their U-series siblings. For the MacBook Air, Apple has mixed things up a little – most computers that use Y-series chips are fanless, but the MacBook Air has a small fan, which means it should maintain performance for longer by better dissipating heat. Not that I ever heard the fan in day-to-day use, unlike the old MacBook Air.Performance is very similarly to a dual-core 2017 MacBook Pro, falling down only in intensive multiprocess tasks, where both laptops are far behind the 2018 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar partly because it has a quad-core processor.With a fast SSD and RAM, therefore, the MacBook Air feels snappy in all tasks and will easily handle most day-to-day activities. It was a pleasure to use. Only if you attempt to do something graphically or arithmetically challenging, such as attempting to play the latest game, edit multiple 4K videos or mine cryptocurrency, will you find the MacBook Air struggles.The MacBook Air is capable of seeing out a work day without having to be plugged in, lasting about nine hours between charges. That was with the brightness set about two-thirds, 20 or so tabs open in Chrome, iA Writer, Reeder and various chat apps in constant use, while listing to Spotify over Bluetooth headphones for four hours. More conservative use should mean about 10 hours of productivity but it won’t come close to the 14 or so hours some managed to squeeze out of the previous MacBook Air.MacOS hasn’t radically changed in years, iterating small elements of the interface with each update, while improving the performance of the underlying system. Now at version 10.14 Mojave, the biggest visual change is the introduction of a dark mode to the interface, which is meant to be for concentrating at night or similar, but I found it a nice change and left it on all the time.Mojave also brought some of Apple’s iOS apps to the Mac, including Apple News and Voice Memos. For the most part you cannot tell that the app is a port of sorts of an iOS app. The Apple News app works more or less as any regular Mac app would, but with fewer features and options than you might be used to on macOS, and the same goes for Voice Memos, which syncs with the Voice Memos app on iOS.MacOS is a mature and stable operating system that anyone who has used Windows 10 or most versions of Linux will be able to adjust to relatively easily.The Apple MacBook Air is available in silver, space grey and gold costing £1,199 with a dual-core Intel Core i5 Y-series processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or £1,399 with 256GB of storage.Options are available with up to 16GB of RAM for an extra £180, 512GB of storage for £400 and 1.5TB of storage for £1,200, reaching a maximum price of £2,579.In many ways the original MacBook Air became the default Mac for most people. It was a highly capable machine that didn’t cost the earth (for an Apple product).The new MacBook Air lives up to most of the standards set by its predecessor. It is highly capable machine that will handle the majority of what most people need to get done. It’s not an exciting or ground-breaking computer but it is the new workhorse for all those who don’t need serious graphical or processing performance but must use a Mac.However, since the last version of the MacBook Air launched in 2015, competition in the sub-£1,300 premium laptop category has increased dramatically. With strong options from Dell, Microsoft and many others that are often cheaper and more powerful than the new MacBook Air, if you aren’t tied into MacOS there are arguably better options.For those Apple buyers who have been lost in the gap between the tiny 12in MacBook and the costly 13in MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the new MacBook Air delivers. In fact, I would say the MacBook Air is the new default Mac – and not only because it’s the cheapest. It is arguably the most balanced and, therefore, best Apple laptop currently available.Cons: expensive, no SD card reader, only two USB-CThunderbolt 3 ports, only a 30W charger in the box, butterfly keyboard has had problems with longevity in previous versions This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

I’ve been on so many phone calls and email threads with people having this issue … In an ironic twist, I am dealing with this.”In an interview on Tuesday, Luckie reflected on the intense debate his memo had sparked and the “disappointing” silence from Facebook, which he said was doing little to respond to concerns or address prejudice and exclusion at the company.“It feels like Facebook can tackle a lot of issues … but when you talk about black people, all of a sudden there is silence,” he said by phone from Atlanta, where he moved after quitting Facebook last month. “There are a lot of black employees who express that they feel the same way. To put out a three-line response that doesn’t have any heft to it, it feels dismissive of an engaged community on Facebook. It’s just sad.”In his original post, Luckie wrote about black employees being “accosted by campus security”, facing discriminatory comments from managers, reaching a “dead end” when they go to HR, and being “dissuaded” from participating in black employee groups. He said there were more Black Lives Matter posters than black employees in some buildings.Facebook, which is battling a range of PR crises, responded with a generic statement last week about efforts to “increase the range of perspectives among those who build our products”. The company’s brief comment did not address Luckie’s specific concerns, including his arguments that the firm’s lack of ersity had contributed to failures on the platform, such as the frequent mislabeling of posts by black users as “hate speech”.Luckie said he decided to go public with his letter after he circulated it internally and received no formal response from Facebook. “They work quickly to resolve issues when they are held publicly accountable for them,” he said.But it was frustrating, he said, that Facebook responded internally and externally with statements by the few black employees in leadership roles: “The image Facebook is projecting is that it’s up to black people to fix the issues that black people didn’t create.”He added: “The historic language to black employees has been ‘pull yourself up by your bootstraps’ and ‘be resilient’.”Luckie, 35, said the response to his post had been overwhelming and largely positive, though some within Facebook have been critical of him for going public.“I was disappointed in my colleagues who sort of dismissed that any of this was happening at Facebook, because it didn’t happen to them,” he said. “If you’re black at Facebook, you’ve had to deal with at least one of the issues that I’ve outlined.”Luckie said he recognized that his post could cost him future jobs or lead to retaliation, but he added: “I’m willing to make the sacrifice.”He said it was also validating to hear others share similar stories: “I don’t want to be alone out there in the world discussing this.”After Facebook notified him that it deleted his post, hours later it said it “took another look” and “restored” it, adding: “We’re sorry for the trouble.”He said it was yet another reminder of the harmful moderation systems at Facebook, which have repeatedly been exposed as biased against a range of marginalized groups.“The process that Facebook has is stifling conversation, especially amongst under-represented communities,” Luckie said, adding of his post’s censorship: “It encapsulates all the things that are wrong with this process.”A Facebook spokesperson, Anthony Harrison, said Luckie’s post did not violate standards, adding: “We are looking into what happened.”For now, Luckie said he was happy to be removed from Silicon Valley and to relocate to Atlanta.“My culture is here, my friends are here,” he said. “I’ve seen more black people in the airport that I’ve seen in a whole month at Facebook.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps.

Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

On 21 December 1988 six miles above an unassuming, Scottish village, a bomb hidden in the cargo hold of Pan Am flight 103 exploded, killing all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground. The detonation was too high up to be heard on the ground but through that silent and unholy night, bodies and metal began to rain down. “And presents,” remembers one of the first responders. “So many presents.”The Stevenson family – John, Geraldine and their two children – had cashed in their air miles and planned to spend Christmas with her family in the US. Students from Syracuse University, such as Nicole Boulanger, were returning to parents eager to hear about their sons’ and daughters’ term adventuring in Europe. Flora Swire was visiting her boyfriend at Harvard, and waiting until she got back to give her parents, Jane and Jim, the news that she had been granted a post-graduate place at Cambridge. In the cockpit, remembered one of the air traffic controllers, the pilots were happy to be heading back for Christmas too.The plane went off radar at 19.02. Other planes started calling in reports of a fireball appearing at the Scottish borders. Police, fire, medical and mountain rescue services began to converge on the scene while families alerted by a TV news flash scrambled for information. “You hope against hope,” said Jane Swire. Nicole’s mother, Jeannine, was waiting at the airport for her daughter’s flight and collapsed, screaming: “My baby”, when she heard. The press was there and filmed her stricken on the floor as her husband lay on top of her to shield her from them and from their new, unbearable reality. “I couldn’t move,” she remembers now. “And that was the beginning of our nightmare.”In any documentary or other account in which the bereaved speak in their own words about their ongoing grief, their loss is palpable and their dignity inviolable. Both are part of them and any record of it is desperately moving and inescapably humbling. The prime directive of anyone who is making such a record is to serve and not detract from them. Last night’s programme failed at several points in this regard. In ITV’s excellent documentary marking the Lockerbie anniversary five years ago, the one false step was to replay the footage of Jeannine Boulanger’s collapse at the airport. They used it in last night’s programme too, along with such questionable decisions as dwelling on celebrities who were due to be on the flight and how they had missed the plane.It was also hard to escape the feeling that there was probably a reason some voices had gone unheard for the past 30 years. The accounts from some of the airline staff and from Jaswant Basuta – who was having farewell drinks with his family, missed the plane and was briefly considered a suspect because his luggage was on it – diluted rather than illuminated the profound suffering elsewhere.Other information was also dealt with too sketchily, distracting from the main approach without informing it. The programme mentioned the ignored warning on 5 December of a terrorist attack on a Pan American flight, the letter that was sent from the British Transport department to airlines warning of a bomb concealed – as Lockerbie’s was – in a Toshiba radio cassette player, but not received by Pan Am until three weeks later and how the suitcase it was packed in got into the hold without setting off any security alerts. It also fleetingly mentioned the controversy surrounding the arrest and sentencing of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi as the bomber, who died in 2012 still maintaining his innocence, and that “many families still have unanswered questions”. Material for other programmes at another time, perhaps, rather than to mark the anniversary – but in that case it should be set aside entirely.Nicole’s body was never found. The Stevensons’ bodies were found in a field. Flora’s father identified her body by the mole on her big toe. He planted a wood in her memory that has grown and flourished over the past 30 years. “We wanted a living memory of such a vibrant girl,” says her mother. “But it’s nothing compared to the life and love of a wonderful daughter. To having her with us every day.” So the world of the bereaved turns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcf1f4214518ac3e5197b4aa6477a3673bc40ccb/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85ec809cb518f897221431bad32ae768","title":"memory lanes the ramblers trying to save 10000 lost footpaths","story":"It’s not just walkers who get lost – paths can get lost, too. Now a small army of volunteers are seeking to recover thousands of public rights of way before they disappear for everPaul Howland is standing in a bed of nettles, his head surrounded by a halo of dusky blue sloes. Behind him is an impenetrable tangle of undergrowth, self-seeded trees and what looks like the long-discarded parts of an a vehicle.“The old path went up here,” he says, waving his walking pole further into the thicket. “I first spotted it on Milne’s county map of Hampshire from 1791.”Howland emerges from the nettles and shows me an image on his phone which confirms his suspicions: we have just found one of Britain’s missing footpaths.“This is Greenwood’s 1826 county map and you can see the path. It was called the Markway and goes straight up to this line – now the A30 road. But compare that with the current Ordnance Survey map.” He unfolds a paper map and points to our position.“Instead of going straight, the footpath turns hard left at this point and heads back towards Andover. What we have here is a missing mile to a forgotten right of way – and a very useful missing mile, because it links to other footpaths.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but there are an estimated 10,000 more that have been lost from current maps. Even that figure looks like a huge underestimate: a recent survey in Cornwall alone identified 3,000 possible paths that had fallen out of use and needed to be checked. That work of rediscovery is being done by volunteers, people such as Howland, who has so far made 85 legal applications for the recovery of lost paths in a small corner of Hampshire. A government deadline of 2026 for such claims has given Howland’s work a renewed sense of urgency.“It sounds like plenty of time, but I reckon that in our area we’d need to make two applications every week until 2026. There is just so much to be done.”As a walker, I reflect, I’m used to losing my way. It’s a bit alarming, however, to find that paths can get lost, too.Howland chuckles. “It’s easier than you think.”If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.You can get in touch by filling in this encrypted form.Your responses will only be seen by the  and we’ll be in touch if we are considering your response as part of our reporting. You can read terms of service\u0026nbsphere.We give up any attempt to force a way through the bushes and set off up the path to the left. Two deer watch us warily from a stubble field and the giant white dish of a radio telescope appears to hover on the horizon as we catch up with a group from the Ramblers, among them Jack Cornish, project manager for the nationwide campaign Don’t Lose Your Way. He explains how government legislation in 1949 ruled that every council should draw a definitive map of footpaths and bridleways, a laudable aim, but one carried out piecemeal.“Some parishes recorded hundreds of paths, others did almost nothing. You ended up with footpaths that led nowhere or simply disappeared.” Once those paths failed to appear on OS maps, people stopped walking them. The nettles grew, the ash and sycamore seeds blew in and, within a few years, they were invisible. If a housing estate or a major road then appeared, that path was truly lost. And it did not only happen in the countryside. The Open Spaces Society has pointed out that urban areas were often exempt from the 1949 regulations and produced no definitive maps, leaving footpaths in cities and towns particularly under threat.Howland has a rough estimate of losses from his own experience. “In my area I expect an annual loss of half a percent – mostly from new buildings and roads.”“Those missing paths can be the vital element in a good circular walk, or access to great countryside.”“These are ancient rights of way,” Cornish adds. “Rights built up over centuries. And it’s not just about walkers: cyclists and horse riders need them, too.”We reach a sign – “Private road, access only” – and ignore it. “It’s a public bridleway,” says Howland, reassuringly. One of the ramblers finds a sign lost in the undergrowth and, producing a pair of secateurs, quickly makes it visible again.Walking with Howland is to see the British landscape through a fresh pair of eyes. Where I see walls of thorny bushes, he sees a double hedge hiding an ancient drovers’ path where I see neat white posts at the entrance to someone’s drive, Howland sees a devious attempt to gull the public into believing they are on private land most of all, where I see cul-de-sacs and dead ends, he spots opportunities to discover lost routes. He reads the landscape like a detective, building the physical elements into narratives of growth and change.He shows me a patch of land on his OS map called Bransbury Common that was declared open-access land under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Almost surrounded by a chalk stream, it was both biologically important and a local beauty spot. For as long as it has been an open-access area, the two bridges that once allowed entry have been unusable. They have never been replaced. “The public have the right to be on Bransbury Common,” says Howland. “But getting there is harder.”He has seen abandoned railways, used as footpaths and recorded as such on OS maps, summarily closed when new owners arrive. In other places, agricultural schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship demand that landowners open up paths in return for payments. When the schemes finish, these “permissive” paths can disappear overnight. On other occasions, new owners simply don’t understand local traditions. In October 2016, for example, villagers in Bratton, in Wiltshire, were astonished to find a traditional riverside path through watercress beds blocked by barbed wire and “private property” signs. A London property dealer had bought the local mill and erected the barriers. It took a two-year court battle to establish that the path was a legal right of way.“There are two ways to recover a lost path,” Cornish says. “By proving regular public use over a 20-year period without any attempt to prevent access by a landowner, and by detective work on historical maps.” What about the Markway, I ask. How did that disappear?“Almost by accident.” Howland says. “In the second world war, a Hurricane fighter base was built here and the path temporarily blocked. That order was not rescinded until 1956. By then it was too late: the last mile of the route had got overgrown and forgotten.” If not for Howland, this right of way would have permanently disappeared.We stop talking to stroll along a short section of busy road, before turning once again on to a path where spindle flowers gleam like nubs of coral in the hedge. A kestrel cuts away across the field, glorying in its freedom. We come eventually into the pretty thatched village of Chilbolton and, in the way of all good country walks, reach a pub.Over a bowl of hot soup, Howland shows me the paperwork that each Definitive Map Modification Order entails. “It does take hours of work, but a lot of the information and maps are now online. The National Library of Scotland website is particularly useful. You don’t need to be spending days in the National Archives at Kew, interesting as that would be.”The campaign has put pressure on under-resourced local councils. Hampshire’s executive member for rural affairs, Edward Heron, pointed out to me that Hampshire has seen a rise in applications from five a year to 35. “We expect that these increases will continue until the closure date of 2026.”The good news is that any application submitted by the 2026 deadline will, eventually, go through the legal process of assessment and consultation.Meanwhile Howland is planning more routes. His diffident manner masks a steely determination, and he clearly likes the elements of research and historical analysis. “It’s given me a better understanding of how the landscape changes and develops.” In theory, that research could go back to the era of Richard I. His reign, which began on 4 July 1189, is the beginning of legal time. In practice, many rights of way date back to the enclosure acts of 1750 to 1850. Either way the sense of a long game being played is palpable and Howland knows it.“A restored right of way will usually last for ever.” He smiles. “There aren’t many tasks in life that you can say that about.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

His people explained that he rushed across from Government Buildings but it was too late.On Tuesday, he was missing again.In Tara Street? The ? Sure that’s within a reindeer’s belch of Merrion Street.Perhaps Leo couldn’t resist the lure of Fintan’s latest oeuvre. Although that’s been launched more times than the Dunmore East lifeboat.Actually, no. It was The Sunday Papers: a History of Ireland’s Weekly Press edited by Joe Breen and Mark O’Brien. Because Leo Varadkar adores the newspapers. That’s why he mainly communicates these days via Twitter and lifestyle orientated social media platforms.It’s how we found out the Taoiseach was at the Kylie Minogue concert on Monday night, along with every other gay man in Ireland under the age of 50. Great time had by all, according to the Twitter machine and the photographs.Then our social media elves told us some lad went on Facebook and swore he saw Leo and his entourage tucking into a free meal at the concert before going off without leaving a tip.Like he would. As a rule, he always pays his way.Gawd, but there’s so much heavy stuff going on at home and in the world at the moment you’d really need a skewed set of priorities to get upset about that random sort of thing. Wouldn’t you?Anyway, the Treeseach missed the lighting up yet again and the Oireachtas staff choir, in spectacularly good voice this year, stoically coped with his absence. (It would never have happen in Enda’s day).Maybe Leo is allergic to trees. Or staff.It was a lovely ceremony. Short, as it always is, due to the cold. Done and dusted in around 15 minutes. But it was a little seasonal treat to get everyone in the mood. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald made a valiant effort to get into the spirit by wearing a Santa hat and going on a selfie-spree. She was joined at the tree by Labour leader, Brendan Howlin along with the two women who head the Social Democrats – Catherine Murphy and Róisín Shortall.“Said the night wind to the little lamb: Do you see what I see?” sang the choir.No. No sign of Leo.The Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, raced in the nick of time to the tree, narrowly missing the switch-on but mercifully making the photo ops. “I didn’t know about it,” he protested. “I heard the carols above in my office and ran down. I’d hate to miss it.”Fine Gael couldn’t muster one senior representative to take part.Of course, the Ceann Comhairle is in charge at this yuletide event. Heaven forbid this might have a bearing on the Treeseach’s aversion to the tree ceremony.As always, Sean O’Fearghaíl conducted proceedings with brevity and eloquence.“As I think about this Christmas, I am conscious of the fact that very many people living in this country are back living the sort of frenetic lifestyle that they did during the Celtic Tiger. But I’m thinking alongside that, we have poverty and homelessness and disadvantage as we have never had before.”He said he was also conscious that people in “the Oireachtas community” know they are “at a point in the political calendar in the schedule of events where the ante is being upped” and they are under a lot of work pressure. But they also must look after themselves.“Because before we can help family and help the disadvantaged we have to be conscious of our own wellbeing. So can I just exort you all to take time for yourselves, time for your family and time for the needy.”Then the lights went on. And the choir launched into a medley of Kylie’s greatest hits.No, they didn’t. They sang a selection of traditional Christmas carols.Kylie, though, was on Leo’s mind. Or rather, the concert on Monday night in the 3Arena and the subsequent minor post on Facebook.After the book launch in the , where the canapés are supposed to have been wonderful and the wine plentiful, he found time to tweet this: “I’ve been made aware of a post on social media saying I had a free meal at a concert the other night. This is not true. There was no meal, we only had drinks and I paid. I have the receipt to prove it too.”Oh, thank God for that.Which reminds us. Barbra Streisand. Another great female artiste. Known for the Streisand Effect – where making an unnecessary fuss about something minor attracts a major outbreak of negative attention. Has the Fine Gael leader ever heard of it?Because with that tweet, he bought tickets for it.Merry Christmas, one and all!"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3720019.1543941718!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"people now being breathalysed going to and from mass d%C3%A1il told","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDanny Healy-Rae   claimed that “the social fabric of rural Ireland has been blown to smithereens”.

It’s not to discommode people - it’s not to make their lives harder to lead. It’s to make the roads safer,” Mr Varadkar added.Mr Healy-Rae claimed that “the social fabric of rural Ireland has been blown to smithereens”.People were angry because they were isolated from company and conversation because of the legislation, which meant they could no longer enjoy just two pints of beer.“People are being checked going to mass, they’re being checked coming from mass. And I’m not blaming the gardaí, or indeed I’m not blaming inidual superintendents, because it’s across different isions and it’s across county boundaries,” Mr Healy Rae said.He asked if the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan or Minister for Transport Shane Ross had ordered the checkpoints, because they wanted the stricter law.“Is it the way ye want to close the churches now as well as the post offices. Ye’ve mostly everything else closed. I suppose ye want to close the churches as well now in rural Ireland,” Mr Healy Rae said. He said bars were deserted and many were now closing and so were nearby businesses.He asked where the promised rural link buses were, the ones that were to be provided with the implementation of the changes to the law, which he said had been announced during the summer.Many parts of Dublin and other urban areas had a wide variety of transport options available. But people were left isolated in parts of south and east Kerry included Glencar, Beaufort, Waterville and Black Valley as well as Currow, Scartaglen and Gneeveguilla.

Earlier, the advocate general of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) published a legal opinion arguing that Britain could unilaterally halt Brexit by revoking its notice to leave the EU under article 50.Opening five days of debate ahead of a “meaningful vote” on her Brexit deal, Mrs May said rejecting it could lead to no deal or no Brexit. And she told MPs that there was no way around the backstop if Britain wanted any kind of deal with the EU.“Whether you want a model like Canada’s or whether you want to see the UK as a member of the European Economic Area – any future relationship will need to be negotiated and will need an insurance policy if that negotiation cannot be completed in time.\u0026nbspPut simply, there is no possible Withdrawal Agreement without a legally operative backstop.\u0026nbspNo backstop means no deal,” she said.\u0026nbsp Dozens of Conservative MPs and the DUP’s 10 MPs have said they will vote against the prime minister’s deal, but she said it represented the best way of healing the isions Brexit has created in British society.“Don’t let anyone here think that there is a better deal to be won by shouting louder. And do not imagine that if we vote this down, a different deal is going to miraculously appear.\u0026nbspThe alternative is uncertainty and risk.\u0026nbsp“The risk Brexit could be stopped. The risk we could crash out with no deal. The only certainty would be uncertainty: bad for our economy and bad for our standing in the world,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

orders removal electric scooters within 72 hours","story":"This file photo shows an electric scooter of the Lime electric scooter-sharing service in Madrid on September 5, 2018Madrid has ordered electric scooters off the city\u0027s streets within 72 hours amid claims they are a public nuisance and just days after a 90-year-old pedestrian was killed in a collision. The council told the three main e-scooter companies operating in the Spanish capital - Lime, Wind and VOI - that their apps do not abide by rules that restrict the vehicles to bicycle lanes and single-lane streets where the speed limit is 30kmh. “They were given a deadline and told that to continue they had to fulfill a series of conditions, including avoiding agglomerations and that the start and end of rides must take place in permitted areas,” said Inés Sabanés, Madrid city environment and mobility coordinator.   Madrid\u0027s ban forms part of a global push-back against the whizzy two-wheeled devices that has seen them cleared from parts of Los Angeles and other US cities. The three-companies began operating in Madrid before any regulations were in place, starting with Lime in the summer. The council says it told them that they must adjust their scooters’ apps to ensure they were used in appropriate areas and not left to block pavements.  Ms Sabanés said that the council would remove any scooters belonging to the three companies once the three-day warning period had elapsed. A spokesperson for Wind confirmed that it had received the order to remove its scooters from Madrid\u0027s streets and that its team in Spain had met with council representatives on Tuesday. Madrid\u0027s streets will likely only be free of scooters for a short while as the council is currently evaluating licensing applications from a dozen companies. Lime, Wind and VOI are welcome to apply again if they make adjustments to their apps, Ms Sabanes said. Madrid police have reported 22 accidents involving e-scooters since the start of the summer, including 8 where pedestrians were run-over.Last week it emerged that two men are facing trial for manslaughter in Barcelona after they fatally knocked down a 90-year-old woman walking with a zimmerframe in a zone reserved for pedestrians.    Spain\u0027s DGT road agency said in response that it was drawing up rules on electric vehicles that would include a maximum speed of 25kmh. Responding to the situation, a Lime spokesperson said: We have discussed the situation with Madrid authorities and are currently evaluating City Hall’s recent announcement around the temporary suspension of the main electric scooter providers in the city.We fully believe that LimeMadrid is an integral part of Madrid’s sustainable urban life and supports the framework of the recently launched Madrid Central Alternative Means of Mobility Plan.Brexit latest news: Theresa May\u0026#39s deal in peril as ministers found in contempt of Parliament for first timeWhat is contempt of Parliament and what does it mean for Theresa May and Brexit?Household leftovers to make environmentally-friendly packaging \u0026#39To have and to hold\u0026#39 banned in civil weddings but passages from other religions waved through, study findsMore than half of doctors considering quitting NHS or cutting their hours, polling finds Soaring hospital admissions for stress amid office culture that never stops5 million healthy Britons will be tracked in bid to detect disease soonerTurner Prize 2018: Charlotte Prodger wins with iPhone video Mrs Wilson, episode 2 review: a mighty confrontation between Ruth Wilson and Keeley Hawes as the lies unravel Former chief whip will vote against PM for first time as he warns her Brexit deal \u0026#39threatens integrity of UK\u0026#39Comment: I cannot support a Brexit deal that would clip our wings when we should be spreading themiPhone app helped trap pharmacist who killed his wife at home so he could move in with new lover Ted Baker founder \u0026#39shoved senior executive against wall over wedding snub then paid him not to talk\u0026#39Comment: The PM\u0026#39s deal slithers us into an indefinite limbo and is a deceit on the electorateComment: Dark forces can be unleashed when parliamentary politics break downMeghan Markle addresses audience at carol concert to remember friend of Prince Harry who was killed in a car crashHow Theresa May\u0026#39s plea for unity ended in one of the most bruising days in Parliament\u0026#39s historyUS senators say \u0026#39smoking saw\u0026#39 points to Mohammed bin Salman in Jamal Khashoggi killingNigel Farage quits UKIP over its \u0026#34extremism\u0026#34 and \u0026#34street activism\u0026#34The best Christmas Day TV: Torvill and Dean and EastEnders lead the seasonal offeringsDuchess of Sussex meets Michelle Obama after hearing her speak on women, race and royal protocolWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nine 10 adults have unhealthy lifestyles national survey finds","story":"Obesity was one of the main risk factors identified Nine in ten adults have unhealthy lifestyles, fuelling soaring diabetes levels, new figures show.The survey of 10,000 adults found the vast majority are at risk of a premature death, because of their daily habits.Excess weight was the biggest factor identified in the Health Survey for England, with two thirds of adults found to be overweight or obese.Diabetes levels have more than doubled over the last two decades, the figures show, with a tripling in rates among pensioners.For the first time, the research examined the overall prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles.Just 13 per cent of adults were found to have no risk factors to their health.Vast majority of adults have at least one health risk factorAmong those surveyed,  17 per cent were current smokers,  21 per cent were deemed to be physically inactive, while 23 per cent drank more than recommended limits of 14 units of alcohol a week. Meanwhile, 27 per cent were found to be obese, and 72 per cent admitted consuming fewer than five portions of fruit and vegetables daily.More than half those polled had at least two risk factors, the data for England from 2016 and 2017 found.The survey asked 8,000 adults and 2,000 children about their lifestyles.The findings show a steep rise in diabetes rates between 1994 and 2017 - from 3 per cent to 8 per cent among men, and from 2 to 5 per cent among women.  The increase has been largest for those aged 65 to 74, increasing from 5 per cent in 1994 to 15 per cent in 2017.The research also compared the lifestyles of children with their parents.Children of obese parents were around three times more likely to be obese than children of healthy weight parents. In total, 28 per cent of children of an obese mother and 24 per cent of children of an obese father had such weight problems.One in 20 women in England is now classed as morbidly obese, according to the analysis by NHS Digital. Overall, 64 per cent of adults were found to be carrying excess weight.This includes five per cent of women and two per cent of men who are morbidly obese - meaning they have a body mass index (BMI) score over 40.Overweight parents are more likely to have overweight childrenIn 1993, when the survey began, just one per cent of women were morbidly obese.Susannah Brown, senior scientist at World Cancer Research Fund, said: “Unhealthy choices increase the likelihood of developing cancer, so it is worrying to see that over half of adults have two or more of these risk factors, especially as we know that around 40 per cent of cancer cases are preventable.After not smoking, eating a healthy diet, being more active each day and maintaining a healthy weight are the most important ways you can reduce your cancer risk. The responsibility to live healthily does not lie solely with iniduals – a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach is necessary to create environments for people and communities that are conducive to healthy living, she said.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the figures should “shame” successive governments, accusing them of failing to take action to encourage healthier lifestyles.John Maingay, Director of Policy and Public Affairs at the British Heart Foundation, said:  “These alarming figures suggest we could be storing up a future of health problems for future generations unless we act now. Obese children are more likely to be obese adults and this, coupled with spiralling diabetes rates, could lead to thousands more people suffering heart attacks and strokes in the coming years.”Almost 4 million people in the UK have been diagnosed with diabetes, with nine in ten cases Type 2, which is linked to obesity. Dan Howarth, from Diabetes UK, warned that another 12 million people are at risk of developing the condition.“To prevent these millions from developing Type 2 diabetes, we must educate people about their risk of developing the condition, and help them minimise their risk by making the necessary lifestyle changes, which include eating better and moving more, he said. Brexit latest news: Theresa May\u0026#39s deal in peril as ministers found in contempt of Parliament for

It might also bring other changes, such as improved connectivity, an improved hinge on the door that clicks open and lets the earphones out\u0026nbspand new features, leaks suggested.That\u0027s according to a report from usually reliably analyst Ming-Chi\u0026nbspKuo, who reports that none of the new earphones will be ready for this Christmas season.Then a year later, in early 2020, the company will bring an all-new design. He did not reveal what those would look like, but previous rumours have suggested that waterproofing and always-on hey Siri could be on their way.iPhone X could come back after weak sales of new Apple phonesThe report made no mention of AirPower, the wireless charging mat that was first announced more than a year ago and has mostly disappeared in the time since. The wirelessly charging AirPods and the charging mat had been announced together, with the new case expected in part so that the AirPods\u0026nbspcould be used on the mat alongside other Apple products.Apple has not commented on a possible release date for the AirPower\u0026nbspmat.

With a name like Legacy, the business could be selling investment products, luxury watches or even legal services. Except the assets in question are of the flesh-and-blood variety. Legacy is a mail-order service for freezing sperm.Khaled Kteily, the young founder of Legacy, came up with the idea for his business five years ago. But it wasn’t until 2017\u0026nbspthat researchers published a statistic\u0026nbspthat made\u0026nbspmen sit up and listen. A\u0026nbspstudy found sperm counts in men from America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand had dropped by more than 50 per cent in less than 40 years. Other studies have suggested stress, smoking, obesity and exposure to pesticides and chemicals may all be at fault.\u0026nbspClimate change could lead to lower sperm count in men, study showsHe was everything I was searching for – in a sperm donorNo-deal Brexit could disrupt delivery of foreign sperm to BritainAllan Pacey, professor of Andrology\u0026nbspat the University of Sheffield, says men are becoming more preoccupied with their fertility for another reason: “In my opinion, more cases of male infertility are being seen because men and their partners are waiting until they are older before trying for a family. This flushes out cases of male infertility that would not have been seen if the couple had tried for a family at a younger age when they were more fertile.”Unlike women, men are not told that “the clock is ticking” nor are they bombarded with adverts for fertility clinics and apps from the minute they turn 30. Many men may not start thinking about their own fertility until they start trying to conceive. Yet, among infertile heterosexual couples, the man is the cause in roughly half of the cases. Pacey dislikes the idea of an “infertility industry”, but he accepts that greater awareness of male infertility has created a growing market for startups offering solutions.\u0026nbspKteily says he founded Legacy to reshape the way that men and women think about family planning. “Men are sensitive about talking about fertility, so we are focused on creating a brand for men to be proactive about fertility,” he says. Kteily grew up in Lebanon, studied in Canada and the US, and established Legacy in Geneva, in part because he wants it to be seen as “the Swiss private bank for sperm”.“For a lot of the world, Switzerland has an association with quality. Think of Swiss banks, Swiss watches and even chocolate,” he says. “We have a strong emphasis on quality, privacy and security.”Kteily had never thought much about his own fertility, until a friend told him that\u0026nbsphe had to freeze his sperm after being told he had\u0026nbspcancer at the age of 30. After this conversation, Kteily went into a clinic to freeze his own\u0026nbspsperm but found the whole process awkward. He believes other men will also be sufficiently put-off by the prospect of attending a clinic to deposit their sperm over doing it at home and sending it to a lab.Legacy offers three packages to clients, starting with the bronze package for $1000, which includes fertility analysis and storage deposit of sperm for one year. A third-tier platinum package “is designed for the man who wants to preserve his healthiest genetic legacy in light of ongoing advances in healthcare”. It costs $10,000 for up to six deposits, genetic testing, fertility analysis and indefinite storage at multiple sites.\u0026nbspCoolmen is a device that cools and maintains the temperature in the testicles to improve fertility in men (Courtesy Photo)The website also contains a note about a research programme that plans “to study the sperm of the world’s most successful men”, which\u0026nbspinvolves strict eligibility criteria and a charitable contribution. When asked for more details, Kteily says the idea to study the genetic makeup of some sperm is still in its early stages. But he agrees that Legacy was modelled in part on another genetic testing service, 23andme. This mail-order DNA testing service was valued at $1.1bn in October 2015, nine years after it was founded. Kteily makes one clear distinction between Legacy and 23andme, which has come under fire for profiting off the sale of customer data Legacy would never sell customer data, Kteily says. It assigns a unique ID to each client to anonymise the process,\u0026nbsp“just like a Swiss private bank”.The UK’s Human, Fertilisation and Embryology Authority lists hundreds of private clinics in the UK charging on average between £175 and £450 to freeze sperm per year. But Pacey says some men may prefer to do a test at home if it means they don’t have to go to a clinic.He adds that the many attempts to develop male fertility products, from underwear, to mobile phone cases, to sperm-testing kits have often failed, perhaps because of male shame. “I have never sensed that they have taken off,” he says. “I wonder if this is because men are too embarrassed to buy them, or whether or not they are simply not interested in this topic until fertility becomes an issue in their lives.”The hidden trauma of male infertilityOne new device is hoping it will fare better than the competition. Coolmen was founded in 2016 in Poland. It promises to improve male fertility by cooling the testicles using a device held in place by a waist belt. “According to the current studies, approximately 60 per cent of all male infertility is caused by too high temperature of testicles, which is the direct reason for inappropriate sperm quality,” Dorota Partyka, programme manager for Coolmen, says. “When we consider this condition, freezing sperm which is not good quality simply doesn’t make sense.”The two businesses will meet at Disrupt Berlin, a startup conference hosted by TechCrunch, where they will be the only two male fertility\u0026nbspstartups in attendance despite a\u0026nbspmarket that some analysts expect to reach $4.7bn by 2025.“The main issue with any kind of product or service like this aimed at male fertility will be whether or not it speaks to men,” Pacey says. But, with sperm counts falling by an average of 1.4 per cent per year, startups like these may find an increasing number of men willing to have the conversation.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Ashley told politicians on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most high streets are beyond help.“The mainstream high streets are already dead. They can’t survive, the patient is dead,” he said, comparing the traditional town centre to a dead body at the bottom of a swimming pool. “Now what we’re talking about is can we save the vast minority?”Continuing with his mortality metaphor, the Newcastle United owner said the only way to resuscitate struggling retail companies was to give them a “massive electric shock”, in the form of a tax on online players. Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisEvans Cycles sold to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Sports Direct sacks House of Fraser management teamAmazon named UK’s most reputable retailer as Sports Direct comes lastHe called for a 20 per cent sales tax on web purchases, to be applied to companies making more than 20 per cent of their sales online, which he said would encourage retailers to focus on their bricks and mortar stores. “The internet is killing the high street. If you want to save the high street you have to address that,” he said. “You have to tax the web boys 20 per cent.” The retail tycoon said this would have a negative impact on his own company, but said it was necessary “for the good of the high street”. Mr Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration earlier this year, and has vowed to save 80 per cent of the company’s stores. He also holds a significant stake in Debenhams and recently took over Evans Cycles. The committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, to which Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”He then added: “Before anybody says it, I’m not comparing myself to God.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It sets off Saturday, 8 December, and is expected to drop onto the Moon early next year.It will head up towards the Moon, fly around it and then drop down, into a specially selected region of the Moon that will become its home.Once there, it will look to learn a whole host of things about that nearby but still largely mysterious world. It will measure the surface temperature, examine the chemicals that make up its soil, as well as looking up at the Sun.But the mission is possible because it relies not only on the lander that will touch down on the Moon. It is also made up of a set of other hardware – chief among them the\u0026nbspQueqiao satellite, which will serve as a bridge and relay information between the lander on the far side of the Moon and its engineers down on Earth.Just as with the world it will explore, much of the mission remains murky and unknown. The Chinese space agency has stayed largely quiet about details of what will happen, including where exactly on the Moon it will arrive.Its mission comes amid a new focus on the Moon – particularly as an important stepping stone on the way to other missions, deeper into the solar system. Nasa, for instance, has spoken about how keen it is to send humans back there, with the aim of eventually using it as a base for journeys to Mars.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But it adds: “We also know that in other settings this good practice is stifled by undue concerns about the risk and safety of such activities.”The report warns that without “some level of risk”, children’s natural inquisitiveness and their opportunities to learn and develop are\u0026nbspcurtailed.Amanda Spielman, chief inspector of Ofsted, suggested fears about health and safety rules were widespread among early years settings.She said: “There’s a great deal of concern about children hurting themselves, concern about children having the lumps and bumps that we know are part of childhood.”The report calls on childcare settings to take a “common sense approach” to managing risk.Ms Spielman added: “It is very important that children can develop physically, explore, do all those things that children need to do to test their physical boundaries.”Schools cannot be ‘panacea’ for rising knife crime, Ofsted boss warnsHundreds of underperforming ‘stuck’ schools are a scandal, says Ofsted\u0027Parents too busy to teach children how to use toilet before school\u0027Gill Jones, also\u0026nbspof Ofsted, said parents have contributed to this culture of fear. She said: “Some private providers have to work very hard with parents because parents want their children to be really safe when they leave their baby and their toddler in a setting.“Parents’ first concern is going to be their safety, but the provider has to ensure that children take risks. So a child climbing on a climbing frame has to be well supervised.“And there has to be the right element of risk there. But some more nervous providers will not take that risk because they are frightened of the ramifications.“They might not take children out on visits because of road safety. It is a fear thing.”She added: “A child that hasn’t had upper body strength built, who hasn’t done the monkey bars, will not have the physical strength to write. It is linked, so that is really important.”Speaking about day trips, Ms Jones said: “It is about the world around them and developing a language, an understanding, so being able to kick through the leaves and splash in puddles is really important. If children don’t get those experiences, they are not going to get the language that they need.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Theresa May has suffered an unprecedented defeat after the government was found to be in contempt of parliament for refusing to publish key Brexit papers.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

success after 10 attempts led to some experts doubting whether procedure would be possibleClick to followThe IndependentBaby girl, who is not being identified, was born after \u0027uncomplicated\u0027 pregnancy following world first transplantA woman born without a uterus\u0026nbsphas become the first person to give birth to a live baby thanks to a womb transplanted from a deceased donor.The baby girl\u0027s birth – weighing 6lbs – marks another milestone in fertility treatment after experts had begun to doubt if\u0026nbspusing a dead donor\u0026nbspwould be possible in the wake of 10 unsuccessful\u0026nbspattempts.While there have been 11 births using a live uterus donor, with the first in 2013, this has usually only been an option where the recipient has a close friend or family member who is willing to donate.Using a deceased donor relies on keeping the organ viable after the death of the donor and the team working with the\u0026nbsp32-year old Brazilian mother transplanted the uterus after it had been without an oxygen supply for eight hours.The success\u0026nbspcould greatly expand the number of women with uterine infertility who have previously only had the option of adoption or surrogacy to become mothers.\u0026nbspDoctors prepare for UK’s first ever womb transplants this yearWomb transplants make unisex pregnancy possible, expert saysRecipient of world’s first womb transplant is likely pregnant, saysDr Dani Ejzenberg, from Hospital das Clínicas at the University of São Paulo, who led the research said their study, published in the Lancet, provides “proof of concept” that many more women could benefit.“The first uterus transplants from live donors were a medical milestone, creating the possibility of childbirth for many infertile women with access to suitable donors and the needed medical facilities.“However, the need for a live donor is a major limitation as donors are rare, typically being willing and eligible family members or close friends.“The numbers of people willing and committed to donate organs upon their own deaths are far larger than those of live donors, offering a much wider potential donor population.”Being able to use deceased donors would decrease the costs and remove the risks of a live transplant, particularly in countries with already developed organ donation systems.The first womb transplants in the UK are due to occur in early 2019 and independent experts welcomed the fact there was now proof of success in both live and deceased donor transplants.With so many kids in care, the NHS shouldn’t offer womb transplantsInfertility affects as many as 15 per cent of couples of reproductive age, and around one in 500 women will have uterine infertility, which can be due to birth defects, injury, or conditions like infection or cancer.In this case the mother, who is not being identified, was born with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, a condition where parts of the reproductive system, like the womb, don’t develop though women have functioning ovaries and go through puberty normally.Surgery took place in September 2016 after the donor died of a brain haemorrhage at the age of 45, with the operation taking\u0026nbsp10-and-a-half hours to connect the donor uterus to the recipient’s blood vessels,\u0026nbspmuscles and birth canal.After the transplant the women began having regular periods, and after seven months the lining of the uterus was thick enough to transplant fertilised eggs which had been frozen after IVF before the surgery.Her pregnancy\u0026nbspwas described as “uncomplicated” with antibiotics needed to treat a kidney infection, which would pose a greater risk because of the immune system suppressing drugs needed to prevent a transplant rejection.The baby was born at 35 weeks and three days by caesarean section and the womb was removed, with no obvious anomalies, allowing the mother to come off the immunosuppressant drugs.Created with Sketch.World news

The document states that failure to comply with these rules “could lead to the termination of the diplomatic asylum granted by the Ecuadorian state”At the time the study was written the baby girl was aged seven months and 20 days healthy, weighing 7.2kg and still being breastfed.As the procedure is still experimental and was refined by Dr Ejzenberg and his team, and will be refined further in future, it is not possible to estimate success rates or potential use.Researchers not involved in the study said the Brazilian team had been able to double\u0026nbspthe time the uterus was kept viable and transplant embryos earlier, advances which could inform future work.Andrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at King\u0027s College London, said: Uterine transplant and subsequent pregnancies, including from live donors, have previously been reported, but this is the first case of a successful pregnancy from a deceased donor.Successful pregnancy, without evidence of any compromise in spite of the uterus (womb) being without oxygen for eight hours before transplant, was unique.Dr\u0026nbspSrdjan\u0026nbspSaso, from Imperial College London, said: “The only other pregnancy following a uterine transplantation from a deceased donor was in 2011 in Turkey.“This attempt was unsuccessful and led to miscarriage two years later, which led to doubts whether deceased donation could work.“Our hope, as we plan to kick-start the UK programme at the beginning of 2019, is for the deceased donor uterine transplant programme to grow alongside its ‘live donor’ counterpart, prove achievable and successful so that both women with willing donors in their families, and those not, can have a real option of carrying a healthy pregnancy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Apple has often held out on such upgrades initially, waiting until they are improved and perfected.iPhone X could come back after weak sales of new Apple phonesLike 3G and 4G before it, 5G is expected to offer a vast increase in speed and reliability. But it is also talked about in much more enthusiastic terms: it will be faster even than internet connections delivered over WiFi, and might improve connectivity in such a way as to fundamentally change the ways that phones work.Such upgrades have previously come with weak coverage and poor performance, putting customers off the new technology. 5G\u0027s proponents argue that the speed increase that arrives with the new technology will be worth such teething problems.Those backing 5G claim that it will fundamentally change how networks and communications are organised. Networks will be so much faster than WiFi that they could make the wireless technology useless, for instance, and data transfer will be so fast that it will allow people to have internet\u0026nbspconnections to places across the world.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Ashley told politicians on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most high streets are beyond help.“The mainstream high streets are already dead. They can’t survive, the patient is dead,” he said, comparing the traditional town centre to a dead body at the bottom of a swimming pool. “Now what we’re talking about is can we save the vast minority?”Continuing with his mortality metaphor, the Newcastle United owner said the only way to resuscitate struggling retail companies was to give them a “massive electric shock”, in the form of a tax on online players. Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisEvans Cycles sold to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Sports Direct sacks House of Fraser management teamAmazon named UK’s most reputable retailer as Sports Direct comes lastHe called for a 20 per cent sales tax on web purchases, to be applied to companies making more than 20 per cent of their sales online, which he said would encourage retailers to focus on their bricks and mortar stores. “The internet is killing the high street. If you want to save the high street you have to address that,” he said. “You have to tax the web boys 20 per cent.” The retail tycoon said this would have a negative impact on his own company, but said it was necessary “for the good of the high street”. Mr Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration earlier this year, and has vowed to save 80 per cent of the company’s stores. He also holds a significant stake in Debenhams and recently took over Evans Cycles. The committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, to which Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”He then added: “Before anybody says it, I’m not comparing myself to God.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Gennady Strekalov jettisoned and landed safely near the launch pad.We are psychologically and technically prepared for blast-off and any situation which, God forbid, may occur on board, said crew commander Kononenko in a news conference.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The BBC could - as ITV and Sky have proposed to do - fairly represent other viewpoints and parties in other programmes on its network.The public has a right to a genuine head-to-head debate on the Prime Minister\u0027s worst-of-all-worlds deal.If the Prime Minister turns down the opportunity of a genuine head-to-head debate, it will be clear she is once again dodging a TV debate with the leader of the opposition on the future of our country.A Downing Street spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The prime minister issued the original challenge to Jeremy Corbyn for a head to head debate, and despite her flexibility on timing and format, Jeremy Corbyn and Labour have done nothing but raise false and flimsy objections to the BBC’s proposal.“There was a sensible and balanced proposal on the table but Jeremy Corbyn refused to take part. He is running scared of proper scrutiny, but we remain committed to holding a debate and will continue to press for a format that ensures a range of voices are heard alongside a substantial head to head.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But I think unless the Attorney General does a U-turn, I\u0027m afraid that he is very much in the firing line.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling defended the decision not to release the full Brexit legal advice.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: The reality is that the position of the legal advice is a very straightforward and a very longstanding one.I\u0027m a former Lord Chancellor, it is a central part of the principles of our legal system that the advice provided from a lawyer to their client is treated as confidential, it\u0027s privileged information.Government has always behaved in that way and actually if government starts to have to publish every bit of legal advice it gets that is going to put us at a serious disadvantage when it comes, for example, to dealing with court cases with third parties.What we saw yesterday was the Attorney General, for the first time in a quarter of a century and more, coming to the Commons, taking detailed questions about the legal position, being very open about the legal position and providing parliament with the information it needs.I think that is the right approach.What happens if the government loses the vote? Ashley Cowburn, our political correspondent, has taken a look at the ramifications.Politically, it would be a major embarrassment for Theresa May\u0027s government - the first in modern history to be found in contempt of Parliament. Hardly good timing for the prime minister, who today also kicks off the first of five days of debates on her Brexit deal.On a practical level, the cross-party motion, if passed, will demand ministers publish the full and final legal advice on Ms May\u0027s deal.So far ministers have resisted such calls, even after a Commons motion was passed around two weeks ago requesting the government do so.But a motion of contempt would ratchet up pressure on the prime minister to publish the legal advice - not just as position statement as was the case on Monday.The motion does not place sanctions on inidual ministers, but if the government again refuses to publish the legal documents upon losing the contempt motion, it appears likely the opposition parties in Westminster will push for further sanctions.This could be brought against senior ministers in the government - most likely David Lidington, the cabinet office minister, or Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general. These ministers could face suspension from the chamber - and potentially miss the meaningful vote on the PM\u0027s Brexit deal next week.Lord John Kerr, one of the architects of Article 50, has said the ECJ ruling shows the UK can still opt to change course on Brexit.\u0026nbspReacting to the news, he said: “The choice facing us is not simply between the government’s deal and no deal. We can choose to change course. There is still time and, until the UK has left the EU, the Article 50 letter can be withdrawn.\u0026nbsp“And despite some of the bogus claims that have been made by those who oppose staying in the EU, there would be no price to pay – political or financial – if we were to take back the Article 50 letter.\u0026nbsp“With support growing across the country for a People’s Vote, it is clear to me that this is the best way forward.”Former Bank of England governor Lord King has hit out at the incompetence which led to the Brexit deal.The withdrawal agreement is less a carefully crafted diplomatic compromise and more the result of incompetence of a high order, he wrote for Bloomberg.I have friends who are passionate Remainers and others who are passionate Leavers.None of them believe this deal makes any sense. It is time to think again, and the first step is to reject a deal that is the worst of all worlds.He added: Leaving the EU is not the end of the world, any more than it will deliver the promised land.Nonetheless the country is entitled to expect something better than a muddled commitment to perpetual subordination from which the UK cannot withdraw without the agreement of the EU. The Independent\u0026nbsphas handed in a petition carrying\u0026nbspmore than one million names\u0026nbspto Downing Street, demanding the British public be given a\u0026nbspfinal say\u0026nbspon the outcome of\u0026nbspBrexit.\u0026nbspRead about our campaign here:\u0026nbspJeremy Hunt is facing a grilling from\u0026nbspMPs over Brexit. Labour\u0027s Emily Thornberry says he was sensible to say he could not vote for the Brexit deal without seeing the legal advice - and asks why this does not apply to parliament.\u0026nbspThe foreign secretary says publishing the advice\u0026nbspwould make government impossible - in a sign that ministers are sticking to their position.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is now moving the contempt motion, on behalf of the opposition MPs.He says parliament\u0027s order on November 13 that the government publish the full legal advice on the Brexit deal was binding and the document published yesterday was simply a synopsis.The government is wilfully refusing to comply with a binding order of this house and that is contempt, he says.Starmer says the attorney general\u0027s reasoning behind not publishing was a plea of mitigation, not a defence - and it is not good enough.It is no longer a matter for the government to judge. It has been decided by the House, which is a higher authority.He said the government has ended up in very deep water because they were afraid of losing the vote. They have been ignoring opposition days in parliament all year.Huge jeers from MPs when Keir Starmer says he has not taken this decision lightly.John Bercow, the Speaker,\u0026nbsphas to intervene to tell them to quieten down.Starmer urges the government to think again and pull back from the brink of being in contempt of parliament.Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader, is now speaking for the government. She has tabled a motion to thwart the efforts, by forcing the matter to go before the privileges committee - ie kicking it into the long grass.She says the government has provided a lengthy commentary on the detailed legal position on the Brexit deal and the attorney general has promised to answer any questions MPs have.I would urge the house to exercise caution in this matter, she says. There is no dispute about the wording of the withdrawal agreement.She says no one could argue that the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, has done anything but treat the House with respect.Tory MP Simon Hoare intervenes, saying opposition MPs had signed this motion by lunchtime yesterday - therefore they clearly had no interest in the attorney general\u0027s speech last night.\u0026nbspAndrea Leadsom\u0026nbspsays legal officers must be protected to allow government to function properly. She says the House could put the lives of troops in danger or compromise national security by demanding documents through this arcane procedure, known as a humble address.\u0026nbspKen Clarke, the Tory ex-chancellor, intervenes too. He says there is a sensible solution to overcome the party-political dispute\u0026nbspby giving a briefing to opposition leaders on privy council terms.\u0026nbspLeadsom thanks him but says that Labour want all information released\u0026nbspinto the public domain without thought to the consequences.\u0026nbspThis motion would compromise the ability of good government, she said. It is not in the interest of members or the national interest, she says.\u0026nbspLeadsom says: What we break now may be very difficult to fix later.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Acts are law, motions are motions. The executive still decides how to proceed.”But a motion passed after the defeat of Ms May’s plan, with the backing of the majority of the Commons for a particular course of action, would carry considerable political weight and be very difficult for the government to ignore.A report released by the People’s Vote campaign on Tuesday also set out other ways in which MPs could seek to steer government action, by amending other legislation still required for Brexit, for example.On Tuesday morning the European Court of Justice’s advocate general\u0026nbspformally advised that Britain could\u0026nbspstill cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50.The legal recommendation cited Britain’s “sovereignty” in treaty-making matters and said withdrawal “may be revoked at any time” during the negotiating period.Chris Bryant MP, champion of the People’s Vote campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “The terms of the Brexit debate have today fundamentally shifted.“The government has long argued that the choice is between their deal and no deal. But the statement this morning from the EU advocate general shows the option of staying in the EU is still open to us.”Keir Starmer says bringing contempt motion over government’s legal advice on Brexit wasn’t done ‘lightly’Ms May’s administration lost two other votes earlier in the day at the hands of shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, with the government found in contempt of parliament and being forced to release legal advice that it had wanted to keep confidential.Kicking off five days of debate on her Brexit plans, the prime minister then said her deal was the “only solution that will endure” and “bring the country together”.To those arguing for a looser arrangement, she said any deal had to respect the concerns of the 48 per cent who voted to remain, so as to “protect the trade and security cooperation on which so many jobs and lives depend”.She also said: “I know there are some in this house and in the country who would prefer a closer relationship with the European Union than the one I’m proposing, indeed who would prefer the relationship that we currently have and want another referendum.“Although I profoundly disagree, they are arguing for what they believe is right for our country and I respect that, but the hard truth is that we will not settle this issue and bring our country together that way and I ask them to think what it would say to the 52 per cent who came out to vote Leave in many cases for the first time in decades if their decision were ignored.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

MPs voted down that amendment by 311 votes to 307.Speaker John Bercow\u0026nbsphad granted an urgent debate on a motion alleging contempt of parliament after a request from all of the other Commons parties. Mr Bercow said he had deemed there was an “arguable case” that a contempt had been committed.Opening the debate, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, said it was “not good enough” for ministers to claim it was not in the national interest to release the documents.\u0026nbspHe told the Commons: “The government is willfully refusing to comply with a binding order of this House, and that is contempt.“Yesterday the attorney general as good as admitted it, when he said, ‘I wish that I could comply with the request of the House, but if I\u0026nbspdid I sincerely believe it would not be in all our interests’. Slightly later he said, ‘Although the House says I should disclose, I believe the public interest compels me not to do so. I’m sorry.’”“That is a plea of mitigation, it is not a defence.”Responding for the government, Andrea Leadsom, leader of the Commons, said: “No honourable member could say in all honesty that the attorney general has done anything other than treat this House with the greatest of respect.“There can be no question that he or the government has acted in a manner which is contemptuous of this House.”But speaking moments after\u0026nbspMPs had passed the motion of contempt, Ms Leadsom said: “We’ve tested the opinion of the House twice on this very serious subject. We’ve listened\u0026nbspcarefully and, in light of the expressed will of the House, we will publish the final and full advice provided by the attorney general to cabinet.“But recognising\u0026nbspthe very serious\u0026nbspconstitutional issues that this raises, I have referred the matter to the Privileges Committee to consider the implications\u0026nbspof the humble address.”Mr Bercow said it would be “unimaginable” that the\u0026nbspadvice would not to be made public before MPs vote on the Brexit deal next week, prompting Ms Leadsom to confirm the government would respond on Wednesday.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereContempt of ParliamentShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The court’s advocate general this morning issued an opinion to that effect, and the court usually follows such\u0026nbspadvice.\u0026nbspIf confirmed, this would make a new referendum easier because a vote to remain in the EU could be implemented straight away – and our membership of the EU would continue under the existing terms, the UK rebate on contributions included.\u0026nbspUK ‘can cancel Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50’However, the UK government would still have to apply for an extension of the Article 50 deadline so that it could hold a referendum in the first place – and that would still need the unanimous agreement of the EU27 countries.\u0026nbspSome enthusiasts for a second referendum might think that the ECJ’s likely decision would allow the UK to cancel Brexit and then hold the referendum. But that would mean, if the vote were for Leave again, that we would have to start the Article 50 process all over again. Which might fall foul of the advocate general’s opinion, which says that revocation of Article 50 notice is allowed provided it “does not involve an abusive practice”. Revoking and invoking our notice might be seen by the ECJ as precisely that: an illegitimate negotiating tactic.\u0026nbspIf the UK asks for more time to hold a referendum, the\u0026nbspEU27\u0026nbspare highly likely to agree to an extension to the timetable.So the significance of this opinion is indirect. It makes a possible referendum simpler because it would present a choice between two definite options: Theresa May’s Brexit deal versus remaining in the EU on existing terms.\u0026nbspThat would take away one of the arguments against a second referendum, namely that, if “Remain” were on the ballot paper, it would not be possible to guarantee what it meant because – without this legal opinion – we would need to ask permission of the EU27 to stay in the EU. That would probably be granted, but it might be complicated to secure an agreement to that effect before a referendum.\u0026nbspIn the next few days, as MPs debate the prime minister’s Brexit deal, the advocates of giving the people the final say can therefore propose a new referendum that seems credible and well defined.\u0026nbspThey know that, if the UK asks for more time to hold a referendum, the EU27 are highly likely to agree to an extension to the timetable. They want us to stay and want to make it easy for us to do so.\u0026nbspHowever, that EU law is interpreted in a way that suits the cause of integration – “ever closer union” in the words of the founding treaty – does reinforce the argument of Leavers that the EU will always seek to become a single superstate.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is a real risk that if we don’t vote for this deal that there may be a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum. And there is also the risk that if we don’t vote for this deal we may get a less good deal, or no deal at all. All of those are less attractive than this deal.“I actually think if there were a second referendum people would probably vote to Leave in even larger numbers than they did before. But the very act of calling a second referendum, I believe, would damage faith in democracy and rip apart the social fabric of this country.”Pressed on the Northern Ireland “backstop” – the EU’s insurance policy to avoid a hard border – Mr Gove said however “uncomfortable” it is for the UK, “it is more uncomfortable for the European Union”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

The PM is in Buenos Aires rightly extolling our virtues to world leaders, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that her Cabinet are afraid that Britain cannot make it on its own. That weakness has been exploited time after time by EU negotiators.If only they shared the faith of those who voted for a brighter future.The scandalous lack of planning for a clean break, as James Forsyth makes clear on this very page, is a result of the Government only ever looking for pitfalls — rather than grabbing the opportunities that are so obviously out there for a reinvigorated Britain.It’s not too late. If the PM loses the crunch vote in Parliament, we must step up preparations to leave without a deal by several notches.And that might well see Brussels bureaucrats, for all their harsh words, coming back to the negotiating table.The disgraced tycoon Max Mosley, via his family trust, has pledged to keep funding this so-called independent body for years to come, as he continues his vendetta against the free Press.Labour donor Mr Mosley is no fan of the papers, and not just for exposing his extra-curricular activities. The media also uncovered his racist past, including pamphlets warning: “Coloured immigration threatens your children’s health.”When that bile came to light, the Labour Party promised not to take another penny from him. But he’s spent years bankrolling their Deputy Leader Tom Watson’s office to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds.Isn’t it time the cash was handed back, Mr Watson Ms Bibi, a Pakistani Catholic, was acquitted last month of blasphemy charges — a charge which had left her on death row. Whilst she’s in hiding, hardline Islamists have been parading around the country’s streets with images of her in a noose. It is clear she will never be safe in Pakistan.We should be proud of the fact that Britain is open to those of all religions and none, and give her a home here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

NONE of them are laying their lives on the line to get inside the European Union.Are you worried about our future  Me too.I am afraid that the ­uncertainty will drag on for years. I am afraid the ­uncertainty will have a ­negative impact on everything — investment, employment and something as simple as our quality of le.Project Fear turned out to be Project Fibs — but nobody can truly know what is going to happen in every possible ­scenario.But one thing is absolutely certain. Mrs May, for all her decent and noble efforts, all her hard work, is offering us a future where we would be worse off than we are today.And nothing terries me more than being a colony of Brussels.For all the uncertainties around all of the alternatives, Mrs May’s deal throws away freedoms that better men than me fought and died for.Nobody has the moral right to give away our sovereignty. Nobody.Our Prime Minister has shown courage and a sense of duty.But she has also ­displayed pessimism and defeatism.She has tried to treat our “friends” in the European Union with decency and respect.All of her sense of fair play has been thrown back in her face.The likes of Herr Selmayr and Monsieur Macron are crowing that the price of Brexit is the humbling of the United Kingdom.They are bullying us.And there will be more ­bullying to come — for decades, forever —we do not stand up to them now.What  can you do with a bully What a cruel and bitter irony it would bethis ­country surrendered to a ­hostile enemy without losing a war! And what a national tragedy.What a heart breaker. What a total betrayal of all the generations who came before us.But this nation has not waved the white flag for one thousand years.Tell me — are we really going to start now  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are there to teach — not to solve the obesity crisis, toilet-train kids or take knives out of teenagers’ hands.There is a growing trend in our politics and our society to take away responsibility from iniduals.Everything from the ludicrous sugar tax to banning speakers from universitiesthey dare to contradict the snowflake agenda all flow from this sinister belief that we can’t be trusted to look after ourselves or make sensible decisions.Schools being used as a catch-up service is a symptom of a culture where too often we’re told that somebody  will do it for us.More people like Ms Spielman must come out and say enough is enough.We must put personal responsibility back at the centre of all our lives. SPEEDBOAT killer Jack Shepherd is treating our justice system with contempt. It is staggering we’re paying for it through Legal Aid.Politicians continually pay lip service to making changes to the legal aid system, but case after jaw-dropping case continues to come into the public eye.It’s important that everybody has access to justice, and financial support is a key part of that.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools. Maybe now is the time to look again at the ambitions of the Le Chances strategy or the ideas behind the Sure Start programme.But parents must recognise they cannot off load their responsibilities at the school gate.Every minute we ask teachers to spend on these issues is time children aren’t learning the Rs, studying our nation’s history or the scientic forces that shape our world.I want schools to be able to do their proper job, and to let them do that, parents have got to step up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her parents orced when she was just six years old and it’s no secret that she’s now estranged from her father Thomas and his highly vocal, deliciously off-message side of the family.So, however well meaning she is, all her charitable grandstanding and repeated declarations of being “an independent woman” suggest she finds validation from being regarded as a, yawn, groundbreaking feminist role model rather than, as Kate is dismissed by some, a dutul we and mother, who toes the royal line and doesn’t make waves.But Kate has no need to virtue signal because she’s rooted in the love and respect of her tight-knit family — a set-up she’s replicating with William, who, after his own fractured childhood, clearly adores the normality of le Chez Middleton.And of course, they’re both equally secure in the knowledge that, post-“King Charles”, the top job is theirs.Harry, on the other hand, has chosen a bride who, despite her efforts at reinvention, has a chequered pastand a burning desire to be seen as more than just a pretty appendage to the sixth-in-line to the throne.That’s understandable.

The British people voted to leave and Parliament cannot frustrate that.”But privately, senior No admitted that while any Commons motion would not be legally binding, it would be politically impossible to ignore the will of the House of Commons.As Westminster was plunged into a frenzy after the shock vote, some loyal Tory MPs claimed the hammer blow could actually help Mrs May win round wavering Brexiteer Tory MPs to back her deal, fearing an even softer Brexitit falls.Backbench Eurosceptic Andrew Bridgen even accused No of conspiring with Mr Grieve to bring on the defeat.Mr Bridgen told The Sun: “I am left highly suspicious after observing that the Government did not appear disappointed at all when the Grieve amendment went through.“Now No can threaten Brexiteers with either her deal or Parliament saying no Brexit - but that’s a  choice.”The defeat also sparked fresh calls from fervent Brexiteers for Mrs May to be ousted.Another rebel Tory MP said: “This again proves it’s time for colleagues to get the letters in.Look what a disaster Theresa May is making of Brexit”.The drama came just minutes before Theresa May fired the starting gun on the biggest show down in Parliament in decades.A few minutes after the crippling defeat, the PM was forced to take to the Despatch Box to open the marathon five day debate on her deal.After arguing for eight hours each day, MPs then vote on the  page Withdrawal Agreement and  page Political Declaration for a future trade deal at pm next Tuesday night.Imploring the Commons to back her deal and save her Government, the PM surprised MPs by swtly signalling she could make a fresh concession to Eurosceptics on the hated Irish backstop.Separately Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn incensed Brexiteers by saying that reopening the negotiations couldn’t be ruled out.And in incredible scenes, Tory MPs turned on each other as Boris Johnson labelled the PM’s deal a “national humiliation” and said it was “finely balanced” whether Britain would be better off staying in the EU.In a passionate hour long address, the PM said she was aware of the fierce opposition to the so-called Irish ‘backstop’.And she said: “I have listened to those concerns.I want us to consider how we could go further.“And I will be meeting colleagues to find an acceptable solution.”Government sources indicated this could involve giving MPs a vote on approving the activation of the insurance plan in .The PM had earlier warned that reopening the Withdrawal Agreement was impossible – and would give EU member states the chance to wrestle back wins from the UK in areas such as fisheries.In a charged debate, Labour’s Yvette Cooper accused the PM of not being “straight” with the House on the failure to agree a comparable deal on security co-operation.And DUP leader Nigel Dodds hit back at claims his party didn’t represent the pro-Remain feeling in Northern Ireland by saying he wasn’t afraid of another General Election.Original Maastricht rebel Christopher Gill could be seen shouting “outrageous, outrageous” from the peers gallery as the PM spoke.But in a passionate address, the PM urged the House to back her deal, reunite the country and put Britain on course for a brighter future.She said: “This argument has gone on long enough corrosive to our politics and le depends on compromise.”Defending the way she has handled the negotiations, the PM insisted that while she could have “banged on the table” and “faced criticism from all sides”, she had done what she believed was best for Britain.She said: “I didn’t play to the gallery. I focused on getting a deal that honours the referendum, sets us on course for a bright future, and I did so through painstaking hard.“Because I have never thought politics was simply about broadcasting your own opinions on the matter at hand.”Defending her record, she added: “When the EU gave us a choice between off the shelf models, I won a bespoke deal.“When in Salzburg the EU tried to insist on a backstop that carved out Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK I faced them down and they backed down.And right at the end when Spain tried to make a move on Gibraltar I stood firm and protected Gibraltar’s sovereignty.”She said: “Don’t let anyone think there is a better deal to be won by shouting louder.Don’t imagine thatwe vote this down a dferent deal is going to miraculously appear. The alternative is uncertainty and risk.“I don’t say this deal is perfect it was never going to be, that’s the nature of a negotiation.Yes it is a compromise it speaks to the hopes and desires of our fellow citizens who voted to leave and those who voted to stay in.“We will not bring our country togetherwe seek a relationship that gives everything to one side of the argument and nothing to the other.“We should not let the search for the perfect Brexit prevent a good Brexit.”But in a staggering sign of civil war in the Tory party, Conservative MPs turned on Boris Johnson as the former Foreign Secretary said no MP would “sincerely believe” is a good one.In a barb at Brexit-backing members in the Cabinet he added that it appears “those sent out to support it know it is a democratic disaster”.He also called for the Government to withhold the £ billion orce bill until the EU has agreed a trade deal. He stormed: “In Brussels they think they have us beat and our nerve will fail.“They think we have got nothing left in our tank and that we want to do a deal at any price.“Now is the time as we all think about this vote for us to show that they grossly underestimate this country.But in a series of Tory counter-attacks ex-Minister Ed Vaizey stood up to insist he “sincerely” believed in Theresa May’s deal.And fellow Brexiteer Roger Gale intervened to pan him for preferring “grievance to the solution”.Backbenchers then howled with laughter when the big hitter said we may be - down against the EU but “we can win -”.The PM walked out  minutes into her arch enemy’s address.With the PM listening on Boris ripped apart her deal and joked that it had achieved an “extraordinary thing” in bringing Remainers together with Leavers and “uniting the whole Johnson family”.“This is a national humiliation that makes a mockery of Brexit.”To heckling he summed up by warning people who voted Leave in  voted for change, not an “endless transition or thinly disguised version of the status quo”.He stormed: “It is a paint and plaster pseudo Brexit and beneath the camouflage we find the same old EU institutions the customs union  single market.“The people of this country voted for freedom, they voted for independence and for a better Britain and for a country where politicians actually listen to what they have to say andwe try to cheat them now they will not forgive us.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had earlier accused Mrs May of putting the country over a barrel.To the packed Chamber – which had earlier included Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson and her baby - he said: “Following the  election, the Prime Minister could have attempted to build a consensus, recognising the new arithmetic of Parliament, and sought a deal that brought people together.“Instead, just like her predecessor - who called a referendum without preparing for the eventuality of a Leave vote - the Prime Minister has seen these negotiations only as an exercise in the internal management of the Conservative Party.”He added: “This Government is not taking back control, it is losing control.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The court was told Lundons mother works at the Whitechapel Centre in Liverpool, helping drug users at the centre which supports homeless people in the city. A sentencing hearing heard that Lundon, from Liverpool, had gone to the festival last year with eight of his friends, reports the Manchester Evening News.  David Lees, prosecuting, said the drugs were found when he was stopped and search in a performance tent. After being arrested, Lundon told police that the drugs were for his personal use.

He is very well respected at work and won the apprentice of the year award at waste management company Veolia UK, Ms Wilde said. But Judge Michael Leeming said a deterrent sentence was needed, as it was an aggravating factor that the drugs were being sold at a large festival. He said: You are a young man of immense talent, highly intelligent and well thought of by those who know you well. This was a series of judge poor decisions made by you over a period of a few weeks. This is not isolated but planned offending, as those texts plainly demonstrate. Your family are in complete shock that you behaved in this particular way. You have only got yourself to blame for putting yourself in this position. Lundon, of Hedgecote, Liverpool, was jailed for two years and seven months after pleading guilty to one count of possessing MDMA with intent to supply.

YouTuber Brad Holmes reportedly pulled one of these pranks on his fiance Jenny and uploaded the footage of her screaming in agony for his two million fans to watch. Brad, , has more than , subscribers on YouTube and is known for pulling pranks on his other half. His videos include him calling Jenny thick, cutting a chunk of hair off while shes asleep and pretending to propose before telling her it was all a joke.   The term Cloutlighting was coined as a combination of clout which is a type of social media fame and gaslighting where an abuser manipulates their victims into doubting themselves. The more extreme the prank, the more likes or followers the prankster gets thereby increasing his clout or fame online. While some of the videos are set up stunts where the partners have given consent, some charities have expressed concern that there could be abuse going on behind the scenes. The tampon prank video, which was recorded in , was one of Brads more shocking pranks.  In the footage, Brad can be seen rubbing the seeds of a red chilli onto the tampon before putting it back inside the applicator. Jenny is then filmed as she goes to the loo but within seconds shes screaming in pain. He then laughs as she shouts and screams in pain while desperately splashing water onto the intimate area. The video went viral but was taken down after people complained that it was abusive.   Amanda Major, a representative of the charity Relate, told Sun Online: Placing something in the vagina that you didnt give permission for is abuse, and a woman on the receiving end of that would be in their right to question their safety within the relationship.

According to her devastated husband Kirk she “wanted to live more than anything ”. But as our story in this paper tells today – she also wanted to look a little dferent more curvy, younger, perhaps like she’d done a few years back. And that terrible quest to look a little dferent has ended in her death from a cardiac arrest following a bottom op or ‘bum lt’ at a clinic in Hungary. She’d initially only wanted a tummy tuck, breast lt and liposuction. But the offer of a freebie bum lt was presumably too good to resist.  There are few of us in our late s who’ve been through the ravages of childbirth and all that follows who don’t wish we were a little more taut or toned. . And while cosmetic surgery was for a long time regarded as an shyindulgence for the young, vain or feckless – it’s now within the budgets and imaginations of us all. Which is why the realities of its dangers need to be in the minds of us all too – and why today’s warning by Kirk so needs to be heard. For Tryce’s terrible story is by no means unique. Only last week we told the story of how another mum – -year-old Louise Harvey – died after developing a blood clot following a boob job.  And in August, Leah Cambridge, another young mum of three, died after undergoing a bum lt in Turkey. These, tragically, are just the tip of the iceberg. More than , British women every year are suffering complications as they jump on cheap flights to even cheaper foreign clinics in the hope of finding the perfect body. The number of Brits travelling abroad for elective surgery is thought to be up by between % and %. On days when we  and -something women feel fat and frumpy and invisible to the outside world, it is easy to be lured by the idea youth can be regained for less than the price of a family holiday. It’s an opportunity which can sound too good to be true. Tryce’s tragic tale reminds us once more that anything that sounds too good to be true... probably is.

It threw her Brexit plans into disarray and created further chaos. Labour’s Ian Lavery said: “The Tory Government is in office but not in power. It’s clearer than ever May has lost the respect of Parliament and all authority.” May is losing control of her Brexit strategy, Labour said yesterday as the Prime Minister suffered a triple blow in the Commons. Following a day of high-stakes votes, ministers will be forced to publish the full legal advice on the PM’s Brexit deal after MPs found the government in contempt of Parliament for refusing to do so. And MPs will get a greater say in what happensher deal is defeated in a crunch vote next Tuesday.  Labour said Mrs May was “in office but not in power” as she suffered three setbacks in just over one hour:.pm: MPs vote by  to  to block a government bid to boot the legal advice into the long grass. .pm:  to , finding the Government in contempt of Parliament by refusing to reveal the advice. .pm:  to  for an amendment by Tory remainer Dominic Grieve, giving MPs a greater say in Brexitthe PM’s plan is defeated next week.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told MPs: “This Government is not taking back control, it is losing control.”  Labour chairman Ian Lavery told the Mirror: “The Tory Government has made history today for all the wrong reasons. It is on office but not in power. It’s clearer than ever that Theresa May has lost the respect of Parliament and all authority”. The defeat on the Grieve amendment was the biggest blow to the PM and will ensure Parliament can seize control of what happens in the crucial days after the vote. The vote won the backing of  remainer Tory MPs, including six former cabinet ministers: Ken Clarke, Michael Fallon, Justine Greening, Nicky Morgan, Dominic Grieve and Damian Green – the latter a personal disappointment to the PM as he was her former deputy. MPs are concerned about Mrs May’s Plan B, with her chances of winning next week’s “meaningful” vote looking highly unlikely.  Mr Grieve wants to make sure that when ministers come back to the Commons to set out their next steps, they can be amended by MPs. He said: “MPs are tonight starting the process of taking back control. No longer must the will of Parliament – reflecting the will of the people – be diminished. More and more MPs are concluding that the Government’s proposed deal is not what was promised two years ago. “It’s a much worse deal than the one we’ve already got in the EU and,approved, would mean Brexit goes on forever because it leaves all the big questions unanswered.” However, Brexit-supporting MPs claimed they were relaxed about the proposal as it would not force the government’s hand. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker, said: “Whatever the outcome of the amendment, it is not legally binding on the PM”. No sources suggested otherwise. The row over whether ministers should publish the full legal advice culminated in the historic and unprecedented vote in which MPs found the government in contempt.  Attorney General Geoffrey Cox published a summary of his advice on Monday but claimed full publication would not be in the national interest. But the Commons defeat means the full advice will have to be made public, possibly as early as today – including the view the UK would be permanently stuck in the Northern Ireland backstop. The nine DUP MPs who voted for the Labour motion along with two Tories were enough to crush the PM’s fragile majority. Opening five days of debate on her Brexit plans, Mrs May told MPs: “There are some who’d prefer a closer relationship with the EU than the one I’m proposing, indeed who would prefer the relationship that we currently have and want another referendum. “But we will not settle this issue and bring our country together that way. I ask them to think what it would say to the % who came out to vote Leave in many cases for the first time in decadestheir decision were ignored.”  She added: “There are others who’d prefer a more distant relationship than the one I’m proposing. But we won’t settle this issue and bring our country togetherin delivering Brexit we don’t protect the trade and security cooperation on which so many jobs and lives depend, completely ignoring the views of the %.” Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs: “I really can’t believe there is a single member of this House who sincerely believes this deal is a good deal.” European Court of Justice legal advisor Campos Sanchez-Bordona said the UK could abandon Brexit without the agreement of other EU states. At the end of her most humiliating day since she lost her majority at the general election, Mrs May urged MPs to compromise on their beliefs.

Born with debilitating microcephaly during the  Zika virus outbreak, he reached his third birthday on Tuesday. But as people in the village of Apipucos celebrated, doctors feared a new epidemic could explode after three new cases were discovered in just two weeks. Dr Camila Ventura, one of the world’s leading Zika experts, said: “These new instances are incredibly worrying. There is a fear Zika may be back.” I cradled Pedro in my arms again this week after meeting him and his mum Daniele, , during the  outbreak.   We have both put on weight since then – in his case for the best. He is still unable to walk, talk and interact with others, but the community’s love for him has given him a le once unthinkable.Daniele’s husband walked out shortly after Pedro’s birth, unable to cope with his screaming interrupting his TV viewing, but she gets lots of help from friends and villagers. It is more vital than ever for Daniele, who was recently diagnosed with cancer. As she attends hospital appointments, Pedro is cared for by his “auntie”, -year-old Elinevza dos Santos. “He is such a lovely little boy,” she says. “When Pedrinhowas born, we knew how tough it would be on Daniele, but none of us gave it a second thought in helping out. “The whole village loves him likehe was their own. People come from all over just to see him, sit with him and make sure he has everything he needs. “Daniele has brought Pedrinho and her older daughter up alone as a single parent and done an amazing job.”  Apipucos is in the state of Pernambuco, which became the world’s Zika virus epicentre in .The mosquito-borne disease spread to more than  countries in the Americas and was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization. The biggest concern was its impact on babies developing in the womb, and the surge in microcephaly. The three new cases in Apipucos – a girl and two boys who are all just weeks old – are the first all year and the only cluster since the virus died down in . Pregnant women are still advised not to travel to countries where there is a risk of Zika and couples who have visited them are advised not to conceive for at least six months. During the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s recent tour, pregnant Meghan wore repellant while in Fiji and Tonga, where Zika had been detected. Dr Ventura is a resident at Rece’s Altino Ventura Foundation, which treats most of Brazil’s infected kids. “For so long through education and the use of repellant we had managed to gain somewhat of control of Zika,” she said. “We have not had one case all year and very few in the last few.”   The Brazilian government authorised hundreds of millions of pounds to states to fight Zika in  but much of the money was misused. The foundation relies on a grant from the US to fund its work into Zika, which will end in . America ploughed millions of dollars into research fearing the epidemic could reach its shores. Dr Ventura’s team was chosen because Rece experienced the effects first and in the greatest numbers. Around  children and their families are being cared for by the Foundation’s US-backed Semear Programme. Graziella Taes’ mother, Inabela, brings the three-year-old for physiotherapy and eye treatment twice a week. Children with microcephaly are born almost blind – although they can see bright colours as a blur. Physiotherapist Lissa Wanderley works with the children, many of whom still struggle to lt their heads and unclench their fingers. “In children with microcephaly, it is very dficult for them to pick things up as able-bodied take for granted,” says Lissa.  “We work with them to try and loosen the muscles, so they have some use of their hands. “It is a long journey they face but we are committed to helping each and everyone as best we can.” Families wealthy enough to afford hydrotherapy have seen considerable improvements but the foundation cannot afford a pool.Locals have called their abandonment by their politicians a “disgrace” accusing them of lining their own pockets from the money intended for the children. After a day in Apipucos, it is clear to see why Zika spread. Broken sewers and humidity after heavy rain provides the perfect conditions for mosquitoes to thrive. A lake’s warm, rubbish-filled waters create a perfect breeding grounds for the insects, which only need  hours to reproduce. Locals say they have seen more than usual recently but many cannot afford repellant. Daniele’s abandonment by her husband is common among men who father babies suffering microcephaly. Many mothers who find themselves giving around-the-clock care to a child who may never walk or talk are struggling to get by on a monthly disability payment of just over  reais . At the foundation, we saw dozens of women comforting each other. Many confessed to despair and depression and some say they considered suicide. But they share a fierce love and protection for their children refusing to leave their sides. Inabela speaks of the deep bond between the mums. “We are like sisters,” she says. “When Graziella was born, I felt so alone. Like I was the only one with such problems. “Now though we have an unbreakable bond. Together we have and will continue to get through this.” The Union of Mothers of Angels provides advice and logistical support for mothers of children with microcephaly. The group now serves more than  families in Pernambuco. Gleyse Kelly da Silva, , founded the union after her daughter Maria Giovanna, known as Gigi, was born with microcephaly. She has a simple message for the mothers: “Don’t ever give up”. Three new mums have heard it recently. Doctors are praying it will not need to be repeated over and over in the coming days and weeks.

This Tory Government is a shambles. I am reminded of this every time I walk into the House of Commons and look at the Tory frontbench. Do they see the country as we do  Do they care that young families are living off foodbanks  How do they explain to their kids why more and more people are sleeping on our streets  Can we trust the Tories with the future of our country  Since  the answer has been no. And that’s why Labour MPs will vote against this Tory Brexit next week. We have to end the need for foodbanks.  We have to get people off the streets. This should be the priority for towns all over Britain. Until there is a solution to that, no one should trust the Tories on our future. Worse than that though, May’s Brexit deal isn’t even a plan. Brexit has already taken up two long years in which the Prime Minister couldn’t even get the Tories in her own Cabinet to agree, let alone her MPs. The House of Commons is in deadlock. That’s why all she is offering now is a vague ‘political statement’, which tells us nothing about the future. If we vote for it, we will be voting for two more years of wrangling and greater uncertainty. It will drag on and on and on. Many Labour members and voters are coming to the conclusion that the only way out of this mess is to let the public have the final say.  Parliament has ground to a halt. Meanwhile poverty is rising. If we can’t boot the Tories out with a general election then let’s take power form their hands and give the final verdict to the public. Has Brexit been a resounding success  Do we trust the Tories with our country  I think we all know the answer to that.

In a documentary based around a number of interview tapes Diana recorded before she died, she revealed how she felt about the unusual answer. She said: That threw me completely, I thought what a strange answer. It absolutely traumatised me. The controversial documentary, Diana: In Her Own Words, featured interviews with the princess from the early s.  She also claims Charles was all over her when they first met. She said: He chatted me up – like a bad rash, he was all over me. He leapt upon me and started kissing me and everything – this is not what people do. And he was all over me for the rest of the evening, followed me around [like a] puppy.

They’re places to go for the personal touch, service that goes the extra mile or just a familiar face. But as online sales soar, the great British high street has dwindled. The Mirror aims to stop it in its tracks and with our High Street Fightback campaign. And, among the slew of Christmas adverts from the likes of Amazon, tempting customers to head online, one stands out from the crowd - and stands up for the smallest of business that make Britain great. We spoke to the stars of the Visa campaign featuring small business owners who are proud to be independent, to see how they remain at the hearts of their high streets and why this Christmas is so important. The Toybox When Loiumlc Lecoutour, pictured above, was told he would be out of a job in just five days when the shop he worked in closed, he knew he didn’t have a moment to lose. The -year-old immediately got started on a business plan to open his own business instead. But Loiumlc knew he would desperately need money - and a lot of it. So, on his last day, at the shop’s closing down sale, he asked every customerthey’d be willing to invest in him and his idea for a toyshop. He said: “The owner of the shop gave me five days notice it would be shutting. She told me on the Saturday morning and the last day would be Wednesday.   “I hadn’t been paid. I was overdrawn. I went into panic mode. “Woolworths had just closed down a few months earlier, it was , right in the middle of the recession but that night I downloaded a business plan and filled it completely. “I realised I had an idea in my head.” What he didn’t have were the pound, start up costs until his idea of asking for help paid off and several people agreed to invest. But it would take time and Loic was out of work. So, the local shopkeepers helped him with temporary shts in their shops, allowing him to pay the bills. And just three months later he set up The Toybox in Victoria Park, London. Loiumlc, now , and originally from Normandy, France, says: “There’s quite a few schools around so weekly, people are invited to birthday parties. So a toy shop is a very practical idea for everyone concerned. “It makes me feel unique saying I have a toy shop. I like making people happy and being useful and I don’t feel like I have to be a salesman. “If you come into my shop, I try to be myself. I like to make people laugh, I try to be myself. I’m the crazy - or eccentric - French toyshop man. I bring the character people want to see.” The record shop   Loyalty is one thing but when Barry Everard heard one customer saying they wanted to be buried under his record shop, it was clear he must be doing something right. His Record Collector store in Sheffield has been a staple on the Broomhill high street for the past  years. Barry knows his customers and his customers know Barry. He says: “We are in the University district of Sheffield, which I think has become more of night-time economy area. Supermarkets have moved in and it’s less of a -degree shopping street. “We’ve gone from one of the youngest members to one of the oldest.” And in a era of ever-present online music, Barry said it’s important to have high street record shops to discover what people otherwise wouldn’t. He said: “I personally feel a sense of importance in keeping culture and music alive on the high street. “In a shop you have a huge selection, we are the biggest record shop in South Yorkshire. “People come in here and find things, we stock the obscure and the unusual and the hard to find. The high street has changed signicantly in the past  years according to Barry - and as a record store they’ve had to keep up through CDs and digital downloads. But they haven’t stopped selling in the entire  years - something Barry is proud of. He says: “Vinyl is back in style, there’s something that happens every year called Record Store Day. It results in a bonanza for shops like ourselves and we get queues a couple of hundred yards long. “We are on a crusade to convince people shopping is fun and we can still be competitive to prices on the internet.” The bakers  When it comes to carrying on a family tradition, Christopher Freeman knows he’s got a lot of history on his side. He may have spent  years as chairman of Dunns Bakery but the whole family have certainly done their time since it started with his great great grandfather in . His dad came into Dunns bakery in , with Christopher taking over in . And his grandson Lewis, , is continuing the tradition by being managing director. Based in Crouch End, North London, Christopher and the shop are valued parts of the local community. He says: “I think the high street is vital to so many local communities. Not everyone has time to go and do huge shopping, lots of people want to shop locally and have a good relationship with traders and shopkeepers. “It’s just a nicer way of le.” Christopher says he has seen many changes since he started running the bakery and feels shops and customers want to move back into the high street, rather than shopping centres. He says: “You can give people personal service to choose what items they want, you can make bespoke things. People like to feel valued and feel important instead of simply a number in a supermarket where you can walk around and not engage with anyone at all. “A high street contributes to the local economy. A pound spent locally stays local - it benefits everyone.” The most popular items Christopher sells include sausage rolls, doughnuts, breakfast rolls and danish pastries. The florist  Elizabeth Blanck has seen an entire generation of customers pass through her florist shop - from couples getting married, having children and seeing those children grow up. The -year-old has run Fitzroy’s Flowers in north west London for  years, after setting it up with her mum. Elizabeth says her customer base has remained loyal over the two decades she’s been open but she has seen changes to the high street, mainly independent shops being replaced with estate agents. And while she is unable to bulk buy like many bigger chains do, Elizabeth says personal service is key. “A bunch of tulips may only be a pound cheaper in the supermarket” she says. “You get a personal service with us too, we buy the best quality stuff out there. “We are in the shop to serve customers - that’s it. We need you, we need shoppers, we need people to come in and buy from us. “You are supporting families so it makes sense to buy from a local shop.” Elizabeth says her own shopping habits have changed since owning the florist and she always tries to buy from a small business to keep high streets alive. She says: “If we don’t have a high street we lose communities. Certain people might not see someone, might not have any family nearby.” The gt shop   The appeal of online shopping is no mystery for Sarah Marshall and Angela Cooper, after all it’s where they started. The pair, who have been business partners for  years, first set up their shop The Dotty House online, creating personalised canvases as gts for kids. But four years ago, they were able to move into physical shop premises and in May this year onto their high street in Gateshead. Sarah, , says: “We both had quite stressful jobs and young children and decided we wanted to change and set up a business closer to home so it made it more flexible for us. “We’ve been in business on the high street since May and we’ve seen a huge dference. We’ve had people come in, we know them, they know us. “We’ve taken a shop that was quite run down and revitalised it.” The Dotty House sells personalised gts and North East specic presents. But Sarah says one of the key things about the high street is the customers can give back. She says: “We look at what people locally have been asking for. One lady was walking past the shop, dropped in and said she writes poems and askedshe produced them as a print, could we sell them  “And it’s actually been one of our best selling products.” "},{"url":null,"title":"school puts 50 limit teacher","story":"NewsSchool puts £ limit on teacher presents as parents buy staff Mulberry handbagsBosses at St Helen and St Katherine in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, said the generous gts which also included dinners at Michelin-starred restaurants put teachers in an \"awkward\" positionShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsSt Helen and St Katharine school \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA school has imposed a pound spending limit on teacher presents to stop parents splashing out hundreds of pounds on expensive gts. Teachers at St Helen and St Katherine in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, were being gted Mulberry handbags and gt vouchers for meals at top restaurants. School bosses decided to step in as they claim the generous presents put staff in an awkward position, reports the Times. They have therefore asked all parents to stick to the limit and theyve also put a pound cap on all group presents. According to teachers on the parenting website Mumsnet, the normal price tag for teacher gts is between pound and pound.   The policy has been in place for a number of years but a letter was sent out to clary the rules. The independent schools Bursar David Eley said: As a charitable organisation we are obliged to have a policy in this area to ensure strong governance. Our staff policy has been in place for a number of years and no concerns have ever arisen over this matter. We have issued a letter to parents to provide clarity and to prevent placing staff or parents in an awkward position. We have a great relationship with our parent body and a powerful sense of community which is built on this kind of transparency clarity. The school, which was attended by Samantha Cameron, has fees of pound, a term. However the decision has been criticised by Janita Gray, senior editor at the Good School Guide, who is concerned it may make parents feel pound is the normal rate for a present. Many teachers believe even pound would be far too much to spend, with one writing on Mumsnet: Id be mortiedevery parent thought they had to spend pound on me, over the class that would be pound.

Theresa May’s dogs dinner of a Brexit deal looks almost certain to fall on Tuesday, not least because MPs know that it hands far too much power to the EU after  March. With no appetite for an economy-shattering No Deal, her own cabinet ministers must now persuade her to pivot to the only other feasible Brexit option Norway Plus. Let’s be clear. The Norway option is a strong compromise. It would respect the result of the referendum – the : vote was an instruction to move house, but to stay in the same neighbourhood. Aside from a few loud voices on both ends of the spectrum, the silent majority of people – Leave or Remain – recognise that we must leave the EU but maintain a close, practical, working relationship with those countries.  On the doorstep in Aberavon I hear that my constituents are fed up of politicians bickering and want a Brexit that can move our country forward. Joining the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area would mean an exciting future for Britain where we lead a group of countries outside of the EU, free from pressure to join the Euro or a European army, but still with access to the job-saving Single Market. Importantly Norway’s Prime Minister and Iceland’s Foreign Minister say they are happy to have us, while the EU’s chief negotiator has offered the EEA, plus a form of customs union , as a route forward. Some claim Norway Plus would make us a ‘rule-taker’, but the truth is that the EFTA court which we’d be joining is far preferable to the more powerful European Court of Justice which we’d be leaving, due to the fact that EFTA has the power to erge from ECJ rulings and, crucially, respects national sovereignty.  Then there’s the question of managing immigration. Norway Plus would represent a signicant step forward because the EEA agreement contains an emergency brake on freedom of movement and a chance to reform the system. By providing Britain with a lever to pullnumbers get too high the EEA agreement consequently ends the seemingly limitless nature of freedom of movement that was such a key factor in the referendum. And what about Norway’s payments to the EU  Well, EEA countries simply pay for the EU institutions they have access to, which seems fair, and pay far less per head. The time has come for adult politics. Norway Plus is a sensible bridge-building Brexit that can and will re-unite our deeply ided country.

The low pressure front is forecast to blanket parts of the country in up to eight inches of snow, with strong gales bringing further chaos. The plunge in temperatures could bring disruption to thousands of travellers due to ice, rain and snowfall. Etienne, which is brewing off the coast of Portugal, has sparked a severe purple alert for the Azores islands, according to the Portuguese meteorological service. And now, it is now travelling towards the UK. Throughout the course of tonight and into tomorrow morning, the storm is predicted to slam into the Cornish coast, before moving north and into Scotland.  Across the Pennines and higher ground of southern Scotland, rain is likely to fall as heavy snow at times. A yellow weather warning for wind has been issued by the Met Office, saying: A spell of very strong winds on Friday could bring some disruption. Road, rail, and ferry services may be affected, with longer journeys times and cancellations possible. Some roads and bridges may close and there is a slight chance of some damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs. There is a small chance injuries and danger to le could occur from flying debris, as well as large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and properties. While its predicted to lose power over the next two days, Etienne will go on to bring miserable weather to parts of the north east.  Parts of Wales are also likely to be hit with  hours of heavy rain thanks to the storm. Scotland could see temperatures dip to a biting - and possibly - in the Highlands tonight. Etienne arrives into the UK just days after Storm Diana brought chaos to many parts - including Bristol which saw severe flash flooding. Parts of North Yorkshire have already seen heavy snow and roads blocked thanks to wintery showers. The storm could also spell bad news for dogs as windy weather has been blowing toxic blobs of palm oil onto beaches - which is attractive but harmful to dogsthey lick it. Dogs assume they are tasty treats - but the substance is toxic and can kill them. There have already been reports of the waxy white lumps turning up in the last few days on storm-lashed beaches in Devon, including Babbacombe beach at Torquay.  A Torquay council spokesman warned the blobs are contaminated with bacteria and other poisonous substances which have killed several dogs recently. The National Trust has reported more blobs coming ashore on popular winter-time dog walking beaches in Norfolk. The Trust posted online We have had reports of potential palm oil deposits washing up on Brancaster Beach. We are currently investigating but dog owners please be aware and do not allow your dog to pick up and eat anything off the beach. We will update later.

Silvano P Colombano, a computer scientist at NASA Ames Research Centre, says humans may not have even noticed the extraterrestrials arrival on earth due to the vastly dferent looks. Colombano says the aliens could have arrived to the planet in the form of something other than carbon-based organisms - meaning they would go undetected. In a research paper, he wrote: I simply want to point out the fact that the intelligence we might find and that might choose to find usmight not be at all produced by carbon-based organisms like us.  The size of the ‘explorer’ might be that of an extremely tiny super-intelligent entity, reports The Independent. If we adopt a new set of assumptions about what forms of higher intelligence and technology we might find, some of those phenomena might fit specic hypotheses, and we could start some serious enquiry. Colombano also says it is worth re-considering what civilization may look like across the universe. He said scientists should consider further that technological development in our civilisation started only about , years ago and has seen the rise of scientic methodologies only in the past  years.  He added that because of this as humans may have a “real problem predicting technological evolution even for the next thousand years, let alone six million times that amount.” Scientist Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock also said extraterrestrial le could look very dferent than expected. Basing her theory on how le began on Earth, she believes the mutants would be large marine-type animals with metallic skins and orange backsides.

Depending on the size of your appetite, some people will be able to eat a whole burger in one sitting, while others may struggle to finish it. The latter would probably be amazed to meet -year-old social media star Kate Ovens, who just polished off a whopping oz burger - and captured the accomplishment on film for all to see.  Kate, a food blogger from Kennington in south London, is well-known for taking on epic food challenges and her latest took place at Libertine Burger in Leamington Spa. The restaurant created an absolute monstrosity of a meal for the petite blogger, made up of nine beef burger patties, cheese, salad and gherkins, all encased in a seeded bun. This was of course accompanied by a generous side of fries. Before taking on the challenge, Kate revealed she was feeling a little apprehensive about the food in front of her, but nonetheless was excited to get stuck in.  She said: I am at Libertine Burger in Leamington Spa and they have created this absolute monstrosity of a thing, which I think is nine patties. I found these guys at the National Burger Awards and they make an excellent burger, would definitely recommend you come down.

I can feel all the meat, she explained. I feel like its coming out through my cheeks. Carrying on, Kate managed to tackle the gigantic feast, clearing the entire tray in a total of  minutes. She now adds this win to a selection of others, including finishing a oz steak at M restaurant in Bank earlier this year. Its the biggest burger Ive ever completed, she admitted.

We all understand they want everything about their wedding to be perfect, but sometimes they just take things too far. And one woman definitely went beyond the point of noas she was planning her big day, as her wedding planner recently revealed. The problems, she claimed, all started when the brides sister fell pregnant.   Writing anonymously on NotAlwaysRight the wedding planner says the sister had been trying for a baby for three years, before finally conceiving. But when the bride found out about the pregnancy, she kicked her out of the wedding party and banned her from being a bridesmaid. Reportedly, she exclaimed: Well, then, I guess you cant be in my wedding, because I dont want to deal with the problems your pregnancy will cause. The problems mainly included altering the dress to fit her sisters inconvenient baby bump.   Instead of being happy for her sibling, the bride threw a strop and eventually her sister left without saying another word. Attempting to remain levelheaded, the wedding planner, who had heard the heated encounter, says she put on her best retail face and continued to do her job. But a few months later things took a turn for the worse. Recalling the awful day, the planner explained: Bridezilla and Bridezillas mom are with me and Bridezillas mom gets a phone call.   Bridezillas mom excuses herself and left to answer. She spends most of the meeting on the phone. Towards the end, Bridezillas mom comes back, slowly putting her phone away. It looks as though shes been crying. Tragically she goes on to reveal that it was the sister on the phone and shes lost her baby. The wedding planner feels heartbroken for the entire family, she doesnt know what to say but feels sympathy tears brimming in her eyes.   The bride on the other hand doesnt seem fazed by the news at all. Instead of sharing shock or sadness, she simply comments: Oh. Well, I guess she can be in my wedding, then, since shes not pregnant anymore. Her comment outraged her mother, whose reaction the wedding planner describes as absolutely terrying. I have never seen something snap behind another persons eyes before, she admitted.

A new BBC documentary, Escape from Dubai, looks at the planning of her failed escape bid and includes interviews with former French spy Jean-Pierre Herve Jaubert and Finnish capoeira teacher who say they helped her try to escape. The yachts last known location was  miles off the coast of southern India when Lata made a panicked and frightened WhatsApp call to Detained in Dubai saying: Please help. There are men outside.

Doctors believe the procedure could help infertile women whose only options currently are surrogacy or adoption. The miracle baby girl was born in Brazil via caesarean section at  weeks and three days, weighing around lbs. The transplanted uterus was removed during the procedure, and no anomalies were seen. The recipient was a -year-old woman born without a uterus due to a congenital condition. She had one IVF cycle four months before the transplant, which resulted in eight fertilised eggs.  The -year-old donor died of a stroke. Previously, there were  other uterus transplants from dead donors attempted globally, but this is the first to result in a live birth. Previously, uterus transplants from a live woman were the only option, but donors are in short supply. Research leader Dr Dani Ejzenberg, of University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: “The use of deceased donors could greatly broaden access to this treatment...for women with uterine infertility.  “The need for a live donor is a major limitation as donors are rare, typically being willing and eligible family members or close friends. The numbers of people willing to donate organs upon their own deaths are far larger than those of live donors, offering a much wider potential donor population.” The details of the September  procedure have been published in medical journal The Lancet.

It can really hurt teams,” said Jim.“We didn’t utilise Jesse and Calvin’s pace nearly enough at Hibs but they are still young and they are still learning their positions.“We have that pace, though, andyou take our three midfielders last Saturday, although Paul McGowan doubled up as a striker because of the system we wanted to play, you look at Martin Woods, you look at Glen Kamara you look at Paul McGowan, every one of them can pick a pass.“They are clever players and they can spot a pass, sowe make the runs early enough we can use that. We have Kenny Miller’s nous as well because he makes clever runs up front.”Looking towards Wednesday’s vital home clash with Hamilton, Jim will have the same squad as was on duty in the capital to pick from.“There were a few bumps and bruises but nothing serious and they should all be OK.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dee boss macca demands more of men ahead of hectic schedule","story":"As he works to turn Dundee’s season round, boss Jim McIntyre has told his players to speak up – when things go right as well as wrong.Jim himself has never been slow to let players from the technical area knowthey’ve not been pulling their weight.He also believes praise, when praise is due, must be dished out.And he wants that attitude to spill over onto the pitch during games and even in training.“We need to be demanding of each other. It can’t just come from the manager, it’s got to come from the players who are on the park,” he said.“That’s what we’ve been encouraging since we came in the door.“If somebody needs a rocket, then they get it, but encourage after that.“If they need told ‘you need to do better’, then tell them. That’s a big part of the game, but then it’s got to be equal measure of praise as well and that’s important.”It’s something Jim wants from his squad as a whole because he knows most will be called into action during a December programme that will bring seven games in just three-and-a-half weeks.A run of games that starts with Hamilton on Wednesday and ends with the pre-winter break Tayside derby against St Johnstone on December , will stretch resources but the gaffer is viewing it as a chance to pick up vital points.“It’s the same for everyone. It’s just about making sure you are recovering well between games and getting ready to go. There’s not a lot of turn around between games.“It’s an opportunity for us to maximise as many points as we can and get back into the pack.“But we’re going to need every one of the squad.“It’s a tough, tough period and there will be times when we just make changes simply because we need to freshen it, not just based on the performance.”Between now and the winter break, Jim will pay particular attention to his “over s” like Darren O’Dea, Martin Woods, Paul McGowan and Kenny Miller.At , striker Miller is comfortably the old man of the Dens Park squad.Jim, though, knows ultimately their experience will help tell them how their bodies are and whether or not they need a break from games or even training.“As a manager, I’ve always made sure that I look after the older players in the group.“I think when you are that age it’s your mentality, you know what it takes to get yourself through a game.“You know what you need to do to recover, you know how your body is.“Equally, you know when to say ‘here we go again’, it’s game time and let’s get ourselves going.”Dundee’s U s are in action this evening when they travel to take on Hearts at the Oriam .And their Youth Cup cash with Clachnacuddin takes place at Station Park on Sunday week."},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee midfielder nick ross going loco with us move in bid for mls promotion","story":"Former Dundee midfielder Nick Ross hopes his move to American second-tier side El Paso Locomotive can provide a lucrative stepping stone to Major League Soccer.After ending a short stint with Brora Rangers, Ross sealed a move to the newly-formed Texas outfit yesterday on a one-year contract with the option of a further year.The -year-old will report for pre-season with El Paso in January as the club prepares for its  debut in the USL Championship.Although no promotion to the ring-fenced MLS is available, former Scotland U  international Ross hopes making an impression at his new club may catch the eye of clubs higher up the American ladder.Ross said: “I’m just looking forward to getting over and seeing how the year goes.“If I play well over there the target is to get into the MLS but that’s everybody’s target so it’s not that easy.There are a lot of good teams at this level.

Upgrading our analogue energy system to a smarter infrastructure will ensure the country is well-placed to deliver the power we need and to keep the lights on as we move towards increased electricity demands. vw, px\"  Just like the traditional electricity and gas meters that have been around for years, smart meters record the energy we’re using at any given time.

This eliminates meter readings, estimated billing and always ensures an accurate bill.They also come with an in-home display which shows your near real-time energy reading, helping you to identy the areas you could reduce your consumption and save money on your bills – a recent survey has shown that eight in tenpeople with smart meters say they have taken at least one step to use less energy.But the real value of the energy infrastructure upgrade that smart meters bring is far bigger than even personal savings.As coal-fired power stations begin to close and more green, renewable energy sources like wind farms and solar power arrive, the flow of power into the national grid is shting to one that’s both cleaner and more sustainable for our country.Smart meters are the basis for a smarter grid, allowing suppliers to monitor our country’s near real-time energy consumption so they can manage supply and demand, and help to facilitate further environmental innovations in the energy sector.Around , smart meters are being installed every month to homes across the country at no extra cost as part of the national rollout. In ,everyone in Great Britain got a smart meter, we could save enough energy to power every home in Aberdeen, Cardf and Manchester for a year.Smart meters help get the balance right, so we can carry on enjoying electricity at the flick of a switch.Sources: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Smart Meters Quarterly Report, June  Smart Energy GB, Smart Energy Outlook, October  vw, px\"  Smart Energy GB is the government backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the benefits of the smart meter rollout."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/5c06292b0d838-794x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen centre for children with complex needs is a dream for charity founder","story":"Building a specially designed centre for children with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions has always been a dream for a north-east charity’s founder.Tracy Johnstone, chairwoman of Charlie House, said the organisation was created in the wake of a personal tragedy.Ten years ago she gave birth to twins Louis and Eva at only  weeks.Tragically, Eva passed away the day after her birth, and Louis has since been diagnosed with severe quadriplegic cerebral palsy, severe dystonia, chronic lung disease and spina bida occulta.Charlie House was officially founded in  after Tracy struggled to find the support she needed and realised that specialised services for families like hers could not be found close to home.Tracy, who is married to Craig and also has an older son called Ellis, said: “The first couple of years were particularly dficult.

Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"college go bust in few","story":"NewsCollege will go bust in a few yearsSenior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsAyrshire College jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshire College will go bust “in a few short years,” it has been claimed. Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring. And a row has engulfed management as they prepare to appoint her successor. We told last week how the recruitment agency leading the search includes the we of college chair, Willie Mackie. A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr. Job done.” If repairs were sanctioned tenants would need to be decanted for a year. Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13663409.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_231118pets_04JPG.jpg","title":"hopping mad mauchline miss doolittle","story":"NewsHopping mad Mauchline Miss Doolittle issues Christmas pleaPoppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsPoppy with guinea pals Ginny and Delilah and cabbage-eating rabbit Jasper. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hopping mad seven-year-old is warning others that rabbits are pets for le and not just Christmas.

Alexander MacKenzie, , of Galloway Avenue in Ayr, was caught with a sick collection of illegal material involving animals and others showing children thought to be as young as one-year old. Police discovered the sick creep had a total of approximately  images. One involved two women and a black dog. And images displayed naked kids – the youngest aged between one and three. Ayr Sherf Court heard at an earlier hearing that police carried out a search on September  last year and uncovered a USB stick and HP computer terminal storing MacKenzie’s disgusting collection. Officers attended at the home MacKenzie shares with his elderly mother. She stated he was at work and told officers she only used the computer for online banking. His mum told officers that MacKenzie used the computer everyday – to go online, for Facebook and “something to do with animals”.  Mackenzie, who has a previous conviction, appeared at court last Wednesday for sentencing. Solicitor Chris Munro said: “This is something that has spiralled, causing him to possess the images. “It’s a fairly low volume of images. “This is a matter of possession rather than distribution. “He appreciates these are particularly serious matters and custody may be on your lordship’s mind. “He resides with his mother and Mr Mackenzie is her registered carer. “She clearly would face some problemsMr Mackenzie was sent to prison today. “He has a relatively close bond with his mother.” Sherf Desmond Leslie replied: “[I have] concerns with the previous conviction and the superficial appreciation of the disposal that was made at that time.”  Mr Munro replied: “There is clearly a risk here but that can be managed in the community.” Stepping back from custody, the Sherf imposed a y community payback order. The perv was sentenced to three years supervision and as a requirement must attend the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. He was tagged for nine months where he must remain in his home address from pm - am. And he was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years. MacKenzie pled guilty to being in possession of a quantity of extreme pornographic images depicting in an explicit and realistic way bestiality between adults and animals between June ,  and September , . He also admitted having in his possession indecent photos or pseudo-photos of children from June ,  and September , .

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please

We know No Deal is an option. But as the Prime Minister said herself, No Brexit is also an option, and MPs deserve legal clarity on that.ldquoThey deserve to knowArticle  can be revoked by the unanimous agreement of all  other European states.

Within the next two years that will rise to  for everybody, with both the Labour and Coalition governments agreeing down the years that such changes are necessary to help deal with the burden of an ageing population.The arguments in favour of the move are sound. When the first state pension was introduced over a century ago, the cost of providing it was relatively small, with just one in four people living long enough to receive it and those that did generally only surviving a further nine years once theyrsquod started to draw it. Fast forward to  and le expectancy is so high that women in particular can easily expect to live at least  years in retirement, with the cost of providing the state pension expected to balloon from pound billion a year at the moment to poundbn in the s. As the bill for state pensions is met out of current year taxation, the intergenerational impact of that will be immense. Anything that can reduce that burden while also removing a rare historical inequality that favoured women over men is to be welcomed.Yet while the change will affect all working women in the long run, it is only those born in the s that are really feeling its impact. Indeed, while phasing was deemed the fairest way to effect the increase to , it has meant that while a woman born in April  could retire at ,she had been born three years later she would have had to wait until she was . Not only that, but with legislation passed in  speeding up the rate at which equalisation was achieved while also raising the overall state pension age to , a woman born in December  has seen her own retirement date sht first from December  to September  and then on to December .No wonder the affected women are irate, with campaign groups such as Women Against State Pension Inequalityand Backto accusing the Government of robbing them of their retirement dues. Yet while Backto last week won the right to challenge how the Government handled the increases in the courts, it seems unlikely that they will achieve their ultimate goal of having the pension-age increases reversed.Nor should they, particularly when the arguments being put forward by the women are taken into account. While at first the s women claimed their pension age should not be raised because they had not been given adequate time to prepare for the change, more recently they have argued that everything from career breaks to pay inequality make them entitled to earlier and longer payments than men.Their points about historical inequalities are are certainly valid. Thanks to huge societal shts in the past few decades we are getting to a position where women - and men - can just about have it all. Indeed, with men taking on an ever-greater share of household responsibilities, women have been freed up to pursue their career ambitions and that in turn has enabled men to enjoy a better work-le balance. That is to everyonersquos benefit.Yet, as gender pay gap statistics show, the near-equality that so many of us enjoy in the home is not being reflected in the workplace, with men continuing to dominate the most lucrative senior positions while women in general continue to fill lower-paid ones. Not only does that put women at a financial disadvantage when it comes to saving for their own retirements, it also means their careers suffer when there is a child or elderly relative to be cared for: regardless of how committed we are to achieving gender equality, household economics will almost always dictate that the lower salary is the one worth being partly sacriced. That in turn reduces the amount that women can channel into a private or workplace pension, exacerbating the long-term gender pay gap and reinforcing gender stereotypes in the process.But these are problems that affect women entering the workforce just as much as those preparing to leave it and, unless something drastic is done - and fast - they will inevitably go on to impact the working lives of the girls yet to begin their working lives too. Crucially, these are not problems that the state pension - a benefit designed to provide everyone with the same foundation income in retirement, regardless of their other means - can, or should, be used to solve.Yes, the Government has a role to play in helping eradicate inequality, and it must be held to account for that. But reversing for some of us a policy that is supposed to make things fairer for all of us is not the way to do it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9129662.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeon-urges-theresa-may-to-avoid-utterly-disastrous-deal-in-brexit-talks","story":"Scotlands First Minister called for the UKs departure from the European Union to be delayed in order to find a \"workable alternative\" to Mrs Mays Brexit deal, which faces widespread opposition in the Commons.:Nicola Sturgeon rejects idea of Scottish independence without IndyrefBut in talks at Westminster, Mrs May urged the First Minister to listen to Scottish business chiefs and back the deal or risk going back to \"square one\".Ms Sturgeon said: \"I used todays meeting with the Prime Minister to reiterate that it cannot - and must not - be a  choice between her proposed deal and a no-deal outcome, which threatens to be utterly disastrous for jobs, business and living standards.\"Instead, there must be a recognition that,the PMs deal is defeated in the Commons as is widely expected, then a workable alternative is urgently needed.\"That means there should be an extension to the Article  process, and we will join with those from other parties in trying to secure such an extension.\"Extending the Article  process would keep the UK in the EU beyond the current March   departure date.:Against the odds: Theresa May begins parliamentary fight of her le to win Brexit Plan voteMs Sturgeon added: \"The SNP will lay our amendment to the meaningful vote later this week and we will continue to work with others to build consensus around alternative proposals that would deliver on the vote of the people of Scotland to remain.\"With the UK Governments own published figures now making clear that any kind of Brexit would make us all poorer, the time has come for all those who oppose the extreme Brexit championed by the right-wing of the Tory Party to come together and make a stand.\"A Downing Street spokesman said: \"The Prime Minister spoke about the support she has received from fishermen, farmers and business leaders - like Sir Ian Wood - who back the deal as it gives them the clarity and certainty they need to protect jobs and living standards.\"The Prime Minister urged the First Minister to listen to these voices in their support of the deal as opposed to risking a no-deal Brexit or going back to square one of negotiations.\"The First Ministers visit comes after all parties at Holyrood, except the Conservatives, united to back a motion opposing Mrs Mays Brexit deal.MSPs will vote on the motion at the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-cherry-why-we-must-know-if-mps-have-the-power-to-revoke-article-50","story":"We expect the case to establish as a matter of legal certainty that Brexit may be stopped by the UK revoking the Article  notice.The fact that the UK Government has fought this case tooth and nail at considerable expense shows how desperate the PM is to prevent MPs having this certainty.:ECJ Advocate General says UK can revoke Article  unilaterallyThe question matters because when MPs vote on whether to raty the Withdrawal Agreement, a vote against ratication could result in a no-deal exit unless there is an alternative.When he referred the case to Luxembourg, Scotlandrsquos top judge said: ldquoThe answer will have the effect of clarying the options open to MPshellip..Whatever the interest of MSPs and MEPs, MPs have an interest in seeing the matter resolved.\"On that basis the petition is competent at least at the instance of an MP.The case was heard by the Grand Chamber of the Court comprising  judges.Extraordinarily counsel for the UK Government refused to take a position on whether revocation is possible and argued only that the case was inadmissible.:Scotlands Brexit legal bid explained as European court to hear Article  challengeNormally where a partyrsquos primary position is that the court should not entertain the question, a fall-back position would be advanced.Instead the UK government invited the court not to open up a Pandorarsquos box.

Amendments have been tabled by two Labour MPs to extend the time for debate.- What are they debating The Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by the Government, which outlines the terms on which the UK will leave the EU and the desired future relationship. MPs are being asked to approve this by supporting a motion tabled by the Prime Minister.- Can MPs change what has been put forward Yes. Speaker John Bercow can select up to six amendments which MPs can then vote on.- What are the amendments Various amendments have been tabled. Labours official proposal would decline to approve Mrs Mays Brexit deal and explains this is because it fails to provide for a permanent UK-EU customs union and \"strong\" single market deal. It also voices concerns over Northern Ireland.Labours amendment also outlines that MPs will \"pursue every option\" that prevents the UK leaving the EU on the terms of Mrs Mays deal or leaving without a deal.Tory and Labour backbenchers have also tabled an amendment which seeks to reject Mrs Mays deal while also avoiding a no-deal Brexit.- What will happen with the votes Its hard to say. Some  Conservative MPs have said publicly they will vote against Mrs Mays deal,  have said they will not vote in favour and more than  have said they are unhappy with it.With Mrs Mays minority government allies the DUP also expressing their own concerns, the chance of the deal being approved with a simple majority of  of the  MPs eligible to vote is highly unlikely.Any amendment would need to appeal to a wide enough group of MPs to receive the required votes to be successful. Abstentions are likely on all votes.- How does the debate work Ministers are expected to open and close each day, with the Opposition frontbench also having their say. MPs will be chosen by the Speaker to make speeches although their seniority - including positions previously held in government - usually influences the running order. A time limit is likely on backbench speeches, with MPs fearing it could be as low as four minutes.It is the decision of the MP speaking on whether they accept interventions from others during their speech.- What does a vote involve MPs walk through ision lobbies - in essence, rooms either side of the Commons chamber known as the ayes and noes. They have eight minutes to reach the ision lobbies when a vote is called.They register their vote on a tablet device and the result is usually announced within  minutes of the vote being called.If there is more than one vote, MPs tend to wait in the chamber and the process is repeated.- What about the House of Lords They will spend three days debating the deal on December ,  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-to-publish-full-legal-advice-on-brexit-deal-after-commons-defeat","story":"The Prime Minister caved in moments after MPs decided her ministers were in \"contempt\" of Parliament.A motion tabled by Labour, the SNP, other opposition parties and the DUP which argued ministers were in contempt due to their failure to fully publish advice given to Cabinet by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox was approved by  votes to , a majority of .It also ordered the \"immediate publication\" of the legal advice.Andrea Leadsom, the Commons Leader, said: \"Weve tested the opinion of the House twice on this very serious subject.\"Weve listened carefully and in light of the expressed will of the House we will publish the final and full advice provided by the Attorney General to Cabinet but recognising the very serious constitutional issues this raises I have referred the matter to the Privileges Committee to consider the implications of the humble address.\"MPs had earlier rejected a Government amendment to the motion, which Labour argued sought to kick the issue into the \"long grass\" until after the vote on the Brexit deal, by  votes to , a majority of just four.This amendment asked for the Privileges Committee to question whether ministers were in contempt of Parliament over the issue and could have delayed any publication of the advice."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-tory-msp-urged-to-distance-herself-from-fox-hunting-group","story":"The controversial Lauderdale Hunt ndash which Rachael Hamilton has close ties to ndash was allegedly filmed allowing a pack of hounds to pursue a fox across a field last month.Campaigners have raised concerns the incident broke the law, while Green MSP Alison Johnstone, who accompanied the League Against Cruel Sports to observe the hunt, said she was left in no doubt that current legislation is failing to protect wildle.The SNP said Ms Hamilton now has ldquoserious questions to answer.A spokesman said: ldquoRachael Hamiltonrsquos fox hunting connections are well known and itrsquos not the first time the Lauderdale Hunt has faced serious allegations of breaking the law.ldquoAnd now the activities of this group have been witnessed first-hand by an MSP and, once again, reported to the police.ldquoRachael Hamilton has some serious questions to answer.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond.

In December , the ground shted for Scotland’s private renters with the introduction of the Private Residential Tenancy for all new tenancies alongside a new free-to-access tribunal, set up to resolve disputes between landlords and renters.   The new system was introduced to rebalance the relationship between private renters and their landlords. Shelter Scotland was one of the leading voices in the decade-long campaign for this new type of tenancy. Last year,  per cent of calls to our free housing advice helpline came from private renters – a disproportionate number as privately rented homes represent only  per cent of households in Scotland – many of whom complained of repairs issues and who often felt the balance of power lay squarely with their landlords, given the limited security that the old Short-Assured Tenancy offered.The statistics on private renting show high growth in the sector, which has tripled in size since . Many more people are wanting to rent from private landlords for longer and looking for the additional security that a long-term home provides.This is why Shelter Scotland campaigned for the new tenancy which, we hope, will eventually provide private renters with the stability they want while retaining the flexibility they need. A key change introduced by the new system is the removal of the “no fault” grounds for eviction. Landlords must now provide a tenant with a valid reason should they want the property back – and tenants can now challenge this at the new tribunal,required. : David Alexander: Rental costs pale compared with other essentialsSo far, there is evidence that shows the new tenancy is having a positive impact. Over the past year, we have been running workshops and talking to tenants and landlords and letting agents.One tenant told me that the new rules were giving people back a sense of security. The tenant, who said she is soon to become a landlord herself, said that “at one point it was accepted that you could be born and die in the same home. But for years the lack of secure housing has meant people have been constantly on the move, uprooted from schools, family, support networks”. The removal of fixed-term tenancies for new renters means that people should feel more stable and be able to plan ahead. One tenant who had been renting in central Edinburgh for the last three years talked about her experience of being forced to commit to a rent increase every six months or face looking for a new place to stay, which was stressful. She now has one of the new tenancies which means that rent increases are limited to one every  months – and with three months’ notice. Although she does feel more secure as a result, she still has concerns over how landlords may “try to get around the rules” – such as trying to evict so they can make seasonal ‘killings’ during the Festival season. This is the sort of bad practice the new tenancy hopes to eradicate.: Scottish Labour calls for ‘state intervention’ in private rented sectorAnother tenant had put up with a bad neighbour rather than move, as she knew her existing landlord wouldn’t end her tenancy unexpectedly, but had heard of many other renters being told to move out after their initial six months’ contract ended and so chose to accept the unwanted noise rather than encounter the unknown. The same renter also highlighted, even with the removal of “no fault” evictions, there are still  grounds for eviction that a landlord may use to end a tenancy so there is still an element of uncertainty in private renting.At Shelter Scotland, we believe that over the long-term, the security and stability afforded by the new tenancy will drive up standards in the private rented sector. Some renters talked about their disrepair over experiences before the new rules came in. One renter went without heating or hot water for several weeks because the letting agency didn’t treat a broken boiler as an urgent repair. Under the new tenancy agreement, this tenant could demand the letting agent or landlord act without fear that they might be evicted should they complain.A year on and there is no doubt the legislation has begun to sht the power balance between tenant and landlords towards a more equal footing. There is still a long way to go, not least because far too many private tenants aren’t aware of their new rights and how to enforce them.In my experience of the last year, private tenants are more likely to take issues to the tribunal or contact their landlord or letting agent directly with issues because they feel empowered and more secure under the new system.The tenant who had the faulty boiler  She said it wasn’t just the fear of eviction that stopped her demanding an urgent repair, it was that the agent didn’t respond to her calls. As another client, whose washing machine flooded the kitchen the day after she moved in, put it: “It feels too challenging asking the agency to do things. It took several phone calls to them and then Shelter Scotland to seek advice. It proved incredibly stressful and affected my mental health.” We need more people to tackle bad landlords and letting agents to ensure that private renting genuinely is fit for the st century. The legislation is in place and private residential tenants have greater rights. It is now vital that they are empowered to use them when necessary – the real transformation in private renting will be when they don’t have to.James Mullaney is project officer on Shelter Scotland’s Private Renters’ Voice Project©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4837290.1543669277!/image/image.jpg","title":"outlander s craig mcginlay on rugby acting and teamwork","story":"From blending with Beckham to hanging with Sam Heughan, the Scottish actor is on the moveCraig McGinlay is going places. He’s already made the move from playing rugby to acting with a role in the latest season of Outlander, and now he’s moving ahead of the pack with a new Bollywood film, Shamshera. Right now he’s on the phone minutes after his flight from Mumbai lands, catching a connection to Scotland where he is due for a bout of fight training for his latest role.“SorryI sound a bit tired and jetlagged.” He doesn’t, in fact. He sounds on a high after a week of meetings and rehearsals for the action adventure film, walking and talking  to the dozen in his warm Paisley tones as he cuts a swathe through the airport, all sculpted beard, Matchless leather jacket and jeans. In four short years, he’s made the move from working as a sports consultant to acting in films, this latest being made by Bollywood giants Yash Raj Films. Directed by Karan Malhotra, Shamshera stars Ranbir Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Vaani Kapoor as well as McGinlay playing the lead villain.“It’s been a bit of a whirlwind in Mumbai,” he says. “I’ve never been there before and I’m just getting used to it. I’m back for a week here, then back to India and we’re filming until July.”We’ll catch him while we can, when he’s back for a bit of dreich weather to cool him down after the heat of India.“I like dreich-ness,” he says, “the fresh air.” He’s upbeat and positive and why wouldn’t he be  He’s running with the ball, taking his chances without getting ahead of himself. With his muscular physique he’s action hero villain material and has played both so far, honing his sword skills and horsemanship as well as his acting. Guy Ritchie cast him as good guy Sir Percival in last year’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, which starred Jude Law and Charlie Hunnam. Then he nailed lead villain Aldred in Knightfall, a historical drama about the Knights Templar on the History Channel alongside Tom Cullen. He packs a punch too in the season two opener of the Edinburgh-filmed BBC  student thriller Clique, before playing a baddie again in Outlander. “I play a horrible guy called MacNeil and the army of Outlander fans on Twitter have been at me over it,” he laughs. “No, there’s been a lot of positive feedback. I never really thought I was gonna play villains because I always loved watching Superman and James Bond and I thought action hero roles were for me. And I do still want to do those, but the latest three have been villains, so it’s nice to do that too.“This is my first Bollywood film and I didn’t know much about it,” he says. “But I do now. Bollywood just gets bigger and bigger and bigger. It was daunting, but it’s been amazing. I’ve worked on big sets – King Arthur and Outlander were massive – but I’ve been blown away by this. There are  people on the sets in India just now, building forts, castles, docks, caves, it’s incredible.” McGinlay didn’t expect to break into the Bollywood market, but after Guy Ritchie finished King Arthur, he moved on to making Aladdin, using a lot of Bollywood actors and the same casting director who was working on Shamshera.“There was that initial connection: it’s a small world,” says McGinlay, who knows to take his chances when he can, and put in the hard work when he is given an opportunity. “I’m playing a British soldier and I’ve been doing screen tests, rehearsals, stunt work with horses and fitness and soldier training. “And I’m doing some fight training now with Seoras Wallace who did the fight choreography on Braveheart, Gladiator and Highlander. I’m also working with my friend Roger Gracie Gomes, who is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighter. So it’s a real adrenalin rush movie, it’s going to be fun.”But McGinlay is not all action and no words – in fact he’s learning Hindi for the part, something a bit dferent to go alongside his swashbuckling skill set.“I speak a little bit of Hindi in this so I’ve been doing intensive language training. I would never have thought I would be learning another language for a movie any time soon, but I’m really excited about the challenge and enjoying it so far.” Not that he’s been out and about in the sprawl of Mumbai to practise his vocabulary. With a schedule that consists of am pick-ups and full studio days of rehearsals, Hindi training, screen tests, costume fittings and horse riding, he’s hardly been out of the studio.“I’ve only been out to go to meetings and do muay thai training at Soho House, although that has phenomenal views of the beach! Once we start shooting I’ll be there for a long time, so maybe I’ll get to walk along it.” Among the on-set discussions has been the question of McGinlay’s appearance, from hair colour to moustache, beard or no beard. “They’re trying dferent looks, dferent hair colouring, moustache, no moustache. We’ll see. If a director wants something, I give it a go, whether it’s having a moustache or dferent hair colour or having to go skinny or bulk up, learn a language… The exciting thing for me is the challenge of trying to become the character.”The grooming issue is something McGinlay has been brushing up on since he started acting and did a bit of modelling too. He picked up Breakthrough Star of the Year at the  Scottish Style Awards and was named as British GQ Rising Star last year, requiring him to get red carpet ready.“It’s all a bit of a change for me from shorts, T-shirts and trainers, which is what I wore before. It’s a bit of a learning curve,” he laughs.Shamshera won’t be released until , but McGinlay is on our screens at the moment in Outlander, season four of the Starz and Amazon Prime International hit which features Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe. Based on Diana Gabaldon’s historical time travel novels following the adventures of Jacobite Highlander Jamie Fraser and Second World War nurse Claire Randall, the new series sees them building a le in th century America. It’s a time of slavery and colonisers encountering Native Americans, with Scotland doubling as North Carolina. McGinlay plays Andrew MacNeil, a Scot who leads a racist mob. “He’s not a nice guy – a horrible character and a horrible situation. I thought Outlander dealt with the slavery issue very well, and these issues should be raised. It was a tough episode to film and it hit home how bad that situation was. There were a couple of people crying on set, and you do feel emotion. The hairs were standing up on the back of my neck.“Because there’s a massive Outlander fan base you want to do these characters justice, but I was such a small part of this beast of a machine that is Outlander. It was amazing to be part of it.”McGinlay was pleased to be involved not least because he sees the “Outlander effect” as building momentum for the establishment of a Scottish film studio. “Outlander is sparking ripples throughout Scotland. You see it at the Baftas, in the press, all the talk of building a film studio. It would be a massive positive because there are so many talented, passionate people in the industry here who are just dying to get in there – we could do some good stuff.”Now  and based in London, McGinlay is modest about his success so far, although ambitious to make the most of the opportunities that come his way.“I’m still new to acting and I’m learning all the time,” he says. “I wasn’t sure how some actors might take it, because I’m not trained in acting and I’ve obviously moved quite quickly within the last two and a half years. It’s early stages…” One of the actors whose path he has crossed is fellow Paisley Buddy Gerry Butler, who he first met at a film festival last year in Ischia, Italy. “I’ve only met him two or three times, so don’t know him well, but he’s been really kind, given me some good advice and introduced me to a couple of people. And obviously the guy’s from Paisley, and doing really, really well, has an amazing career.”At one time McGinlay was destined for a rugby career, playing for the national under-s team in the World Cup, but was forced out by injury in . “I dislocated my shoulder playing in a World Cup in Italy and had two operations. I could probably have come back and played as it doesn’t cause me any hassle now. I liked the game, but I probably didn’t love it enough.” Determined to stay in sport, McGinlay did a sports science and physiology degree at the University of Stirling and after graduating started working with professional athletes. Setting up his own consultancy, he worked with professional footballers and rugby players, focusing on general fitness and doing sports massage. He trained athletes for the  Delhi,  London and  Commonwealth Games, working with the hockey, badminton, swimming, cycling, weightlting teams. “Then they took the ones I was working with to make an advert for the Games and said the weightlter was a little bit too short, would I step in  Why not  I had to pull on this tiny one-piece weightlting outfit and was out in the cold by the Squinty Bridge [in Glasgow] with everyone looking, thinking, ‘What is this idiot doing, lting a bar above his head’, doing a clean jerk.” He laughs. “Anyway, the ad came out and randomly a director saw it and I got a lead role in a short film that randomly won best thriller in LA and Calgary so I went out for the premiere. It wasn’t Hollywood or anything, but it was a great experience and I hadn’t done anything like that before. I loved it.” Back home in Glasgow, McGinlay signed up with an extras agency and did a couple of adverts, one being for the Haig Club whisky, starring the brand collaborator David Beckham and the stunning Scottish landscape, directed by Guy Ritchie. “It was just five days’ shooting, but I got to know Guy quite well and that was a turning point for me. I was standing in Glencoe looking down at Guy behind the monitor and [cinematographer] John Mathieson behind the camera and [film pilot] Marc Wolff taking shots of Beckham riding his motorbike up Glencoe, and that was it for me. So many great movies were made there, like Skyfall, and it felt so cinematic, although it was an advert. I decided: when I come off this I’m gonna go back, quit my job, move to London at least give it a go. If it doesn’t work out, then, you know, it’s not worked out…”But it did work out: within four months McGinlay had an agent, auditioned for Ritchie’s King Arthur and landed the part of Sir Percival. “It was very hard to give up my job because it was going well and I did love it, but I can always go back. I wanted to keep going with the wave, having done the advert, met Guy, wanted to keep the pace going and move to London. So that was another turning point: I moved down and did King Arthur, then got Knightfall.” With Chris Pine famously watching Scottish rugby captains on YouTube to prepare for his role of Robert the Bruce in Outlaw King, McGinlay has the advantage, being the real McGinlay and able to jink the middle man. For him, the worlds of rugby and acting are not so far apart. “There are similarities, things like bulking up and getting fit and ‘in the zone’. How I prepared in the dressing room as a rugby player is still how I build up for a fight scene or any kind of fight choreography. You pump yourself up for it. Outlander was the same, marching at the head of a mob, you’ve got to get yourself into a zone and turn yourself into a dferent character. “Running out onto a sports field you have to play a character a bit as well. You’ve got to make that last tackle, be aggressive, stand up for yourself. Rugby’s about teamwork and it’s the same in acting – costume, hair, make-up, director, producer, writer, everyone’s trying to do their best.”As someone who never seems to stand stillit’s time for McGinlay to catch his next flight. “I’m not in any way there or where I want to be yet. It’s very early stages. I’m still massively learning. I’ve had a few good short film roles, three good roles in three big productions so far and this is the fourth one now, so it’s going well, but I’m still way, way short of where I want to be. “I’ve not made it or anything. I still have a long, long way to go and I’m very ambitious. If I quit my job to move into this, then I’m not in it for a laugh, I’m in it to go as far as I can.” Craig McGinlay can currently be seen in Season  of Outlander, available to watch now on Amazon Prime.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie

to reintroduce lynx to britain rejected by government","story":"A bid to bring back the lynx, which became extinct in the UK more than , years ago, has been rejected by the Government.Lynx UK Trust applied for a licence for a trial reintroduction of six Eurasian lynx, which it says disappeared from Britain around the year AD, into Kielder Forest in Northumberland to recreate a more natural ecosystem.The cats were lost from much of western Europe in the face of the destruction of its habitat and persecution by humans but they have been successfully reintroduced in some countries.Environment Secretary Michael Gove has written to the trustinforming it he has accepted Government conservation agency Natural England’s advice not to grant a licence for the scheme.Mr Gove said the Government remained committed to the reintroduction of once-native species when there are “comprehensive proposals” and clear environmental, social and economic benefits.Natural England had concerns about the feasibility of the project, including how it would be funded and a reliance on volunteers, he said.: Leader comment: Scotland should be cautious about lynx reintroductionThe application did not include an ecological assessment providing assurances the area was suitable for a reintroduction and did not demonstrate sufficient engagement with landowners or local support.In his letter, Mr Gove said: “Kielder Forest is an area where the Forest Commission has been taking action to manage and restore important habitats and ecosystem s to enhance bioersity.“This has included the release of hundreds of water vole and the removal of mink from the Tyne and monitoring theand spread of pine martens to understand options for their recovery.“The area has also seen signicant recolonisation by a number of bird species as a result of continued efforts, all of which is positive news.”He said he hoped the trust could support the need to undertake the reintroduction of species in a “considered manner”, which could positively contribute to the natural system of the area and ensure maximum benefits to the local environment and people using it.Supporters of reintroducing lynx believe the cats would bring a range of benefits, including helping to control deer numbers, reducing damage to the forest and improving habitat for smaller animals, as well as providing eco-tourism opportunities.Opponents, such as the National Sheep Association , have raised concerns about the potential impacts, including losses of livestock and the welfare of the wild animals released into the “busy, industrial forest”.NSA chief executive Phil Stocker said: “We strongly believe this is the right decision on ecological, social and agricultural grounds.“Today’s victory is not just for farmers but for the ecology of the area, the rural community and the farming economy.“The threat of the lynx against sheep was very real and we could not be happier that this isn’t a risk our members will have to face.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie

Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies. LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision.

leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

Fergie and I hope to see you soon on Skye!”Creator Calum MacDonald was inspired by a previous drawing by his niece, Sadie MacDonald.Calum said: “In November , following on from Skye receiving negative publicity during that summer, I was inspired by a drawing my niece had drawn of her family. I came up with the idea of creating a character from Skye, acting as a friendly face for the island and having him help solve the problems Skye was facing.“Since then Donald has developed into an animated character and is the star, along with Fergie the Tractor, of his own animated film. Donald and Fergie answer any questions visitors might have about Skye on the website and we hope to add further episodes of Donald from Skye soon.“The Donald from Skye website acts as a hub of information for visitors, with business listings, a ‘recommended by Donald’ list and clips of Donald and Fergie.

He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers.

On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role ‘very interesting’Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":null,"title":"john bercow tells mps arguable case contempt committed by government over brexit legal advice","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brexit backstop could continue indefinitely, Government legal advice suggests Brexit: What do the Government’s legal position papers say  Opposition parties complained, after a fractious two-and-a-half-hour debate, that the summary legal advice released by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox did not comply with a Commons resolution agreed on November . Mr Cox, who is the Governments chief legal adviser, had staunchly defended the decision - telling MPs \"there is nothing to see here\". The Speaker however, in a statement to the Commons, said he was \"satisfied\" the matter should be put before MPs to consider on Tuesday morning. He said: \"The letter that I received from the members mentioned at the start of this statement asks me to give precedence to a motion relating to privilege in relation to the failure of ministers to comply with the terms of the resolution of the House of the  November.\" Mr Bercow stopped his statement to scold Government chief whip Julian Smith, who was talking to ministers on the frontbench, saying: \"It would seem courteoushe could just hold off for a moment and allow me to make the statement that would appear to show perhaps a proper politeness.\" He added: \"I have considered the matter carefully and I am satisfied that there is an arguable case that a contempt has been committed. Im therefore giving precedence for a motion to be tabled tonight before the House rises and to be taken as first business tomorrow.\" Mr Bercow said it was \"entirely for the House to decide on that motion\". The Attorney General earlier said that he \"fully accepts\" MPs may impose a sanction against him or the Government for contempt of Parliament over Brexit legal advice. He said: \"The House has at its disposal the means by which to enforce its will. \"It can bring a motion of contempt and seek to have that motion passed and seek to impose through the committee, or whichever way it is appropriately done, to impose a sanction.

Of course, they do.“Heaven knows, I think we probably all share that sentiment.“But it’s a con. It’s perhaps the biggest con of all.“If we pass this deal in this House, it won’t be over, the really serious stuff hasn’t even started, and it’s going to go on for years.”Tory former minister Anna Soubry later gave a withering evaluation of the Government’s handling of Brexit over the last two years.She said: “The great failing was from the outset when instead of reaching out across this House and across our country to heal the isions, to bring together the  and the  I’m afraid and sorry to say the exact opposite was done.“The % were tossed aside, we were abused, we were sidelined,we had even the temerity to question almost anything we were called remoaners.”She later said the Government had verged on the “irresponsible” using the slogan “no deal is better than a bad deal”.Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, also condemned the Government’s handling of Brexit — telling ministers Theresa May’s redlines had been an “absolutely catastrophic misstep”.He added: “We have no idea where we’re going, no idea where we’re going to end up, no clarity, no certainty.”Conservative former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson raised concerns over the deal, including on border arrangements, saying: “We must vote against this ghastly proposal – it’s absolutely appalling and I’m delighted so many members from across the House are going to vote against it.”Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve suggested the central premise of Brexit was so impossible that “archangels” could not have negotiated a better deal than Mrs May, and “sterile debate” would drag on for years and “destroy this country”.He said: “Quite frankly we might have been led by archangels to get a better outcome because in all negotiations you move toward the mean centre and it is where the power lies where you end up getting the agreement.“The consequence is that far from detaching ourselves from a complicated international treaty… we are in the process of enmeshing ourselves in another very complex international treaty – but one that is much more disadvantageous to this country than the one we are leaving.“In reality, far from bringing this debate to an end, we are only just embarking upon it – and it will destroy this country over years of sterile debate about a future relationship.”Pro-EU Tory MP Ed Vaizey attacked his Eurosceptic colleagues for wanting to complain about whatever Brexit deal the PM does.The former minister rejected the suggestion a committed Brexiteer would have got a better negotiation with the EU, saying: “I think too many Brexiteers fantasised about what Brexit would look like without confronting the cold reality.”Referring to his fellow Conservatives he said: “All of you Brexiteers will complain, complain about the Withdrawal Clause,we do crash out with no deal you’ll say that nobody prepared for it.“Nothing is ever the Brexiteers fault.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit would uk membership of the eea work","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

last-ditch attempt to rally MPs behind her Brexit deal after suffering the historic humiliation of seeing her Government found in contempt of Parliament..pushIn dramatic scenes at Westminster, the Government bowed to pressure to publish the “final and full” legal advice to Cabinet on the deal after MPs voted by  to  that its failure to do so amounted to contempt.The Prime Minister’s Democratic Unionist Party allies – along with Tory MPs Philip Hollobone and Peter Bone – joined opposition parties in the unprecedented move.It is the first time in modern history that any Government has been found in contempt and means the highly sensitive advice provided by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will be published, in contravention of long-standing practice.Ministers are expected to set out tomorrow how this will be done.The vote came shortly before Mrs May kicked off a five-day debate ahead of the December  “meaningful vote” with a speech lasting more than an hour in which she told MPs she had delivered “the very best deal for the British people” and backed it “with my whole heart”.Before the Prime Minister appeared at the despatch box, her Government had gone down to defeat for the third time in an hour.MPs backed a move that could put Parliament in the driving seatthe Brexit deal is rejected on December  by giving the Commons the power to amend a motion that Mrs May would be required to make within the following  days to set out the Government’s next steps.Some  Tory MPs – including former ministers Sir Michael Fallon, Damian Green and Sir Oliver Letwin – rebelled on the amendment tabled by ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve.This could open the door for the Commons to throw its weight behind a Norway-style soft Brexit or even a second EU referendum, though prominent Leave-backing MPs questioned whether any such vote would be binding on ministers.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The House of Commons found the Government in contempt by a margin of  to  Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the finding of contempt was “a badge of shame” for the Government, with “huge constitutional and political signicance”.“By treating Parliament with contempt, the Government has proved it has lost its majority and the respect of the House,” Sir Keir said.“The Prime Minister can’t keep pushing Parliament away or avoiding responsible scrutiny.”Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable repeated calls for a second EU referendum, saying: “Theresa May’s majority has evaporated and the credibility of her deal is evaporating with it.”AskedMrs May still felt she could command a majority in the Commons for the crunch vote next Tuesday, a Downing Street source said: “Everybody knows the parliamentary arithmetic.“The fact is, during the course of this administration we have won the overwhelming majority of votes that have taken place on the floor of the House of Commons.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Opening debate on the deal she struck in Brussels last month, Mrs May warned: “Don’t imagine thatwe vote this down another deal is going to miraculously appear.“The alternative is uncertainty and risk – the risk Brexit could be stopped, the risk we could crash out with no deal.”She said it would not be in the “national interest” to block the Withdrawal Agreement, adding: “The only certainty would be uncertainty.”MPs’ decisions over the next week would “set the course our country takes for decades to come”, she said.Mrs May told them: “I promise you today this is the very best deal for the British people, I ask you to back it in the best interests of our constituents and our country.“And with my whole heart I commend this motion to the House.”In a speech repeatedly interrupted by MPs attacking her deal, the Prime Minister pledged to give Parliament and the devolved administrations a “greater and more formal role” in forthcoming negotiations with the EU over trade – but declined to say whether MPs would get a vote on that deal.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May’s deal would “make this country worse off”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Attorney General Geoffrey Cox The drama

Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations. Would membership of the EEA work  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement. But she insisted a second referendum was not an option as it could not be held before March ,  when Britain leaves the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"no deal would bring significant future economic benefits exbrexit minister","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She said the forecasts were “totally overblown” and had been “disparaged by many serious economists”. “They completely exaggerate the benefits of our membership with the EU, and they minimise any of the opportunities from free trade agreements with other countries and they overplay the obstacles presented from coming out of the EU in a way that doesn’t match reality,” she explained.Mrs Braverman added: “There are challenges to no deal but it would be definitely better than this deal. To coin the phrase ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’ – that’s exactly the situation we’re in now.”"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

aiming to win support from MPs ahead of a crucial vote on December .Here are the key points you need to know from day one of the debates.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  MPs gathered in the House of Commons for the first of five days of debates Day of defeatsBefore the debate could even get going, Mrs May suffered a series of bruising Commons defeats which saw her authority take a pounding.Ministers had to agree to publish the “final and full” legal advice on the withdrawal agreement as the Government was found to be in contempt of Parliament for not already doing so.And in another blow to the PM, MPs succeeded in calls for the Commons to have a direct say in what happensher deal is rejected next Tuesday.The votes delayed the start of the five-day debate by several hours.It’s about compromise, says the PMOpening the debate on the Brexit deal, Mrs May said MPs needed to accept that compromise was necessary to “bring the country together”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Prime Minister Theresa May pitches her deal to MPs She said the “only solution that will endure” was one that addressed the concerns of both sides of the debate.The PM warned that the country would be plunged into “uncertainty and risk”her deal was rejected, adding: “Don’t imagine thatwe vote this down another deal is going to miraculously appear.”She also appeared to soften her approach to Parliament as she pledged to give MPs a “greater and more formal role” in the UK’s forthcoming negotiations with the EU over future trade.Mrs May said she wanted to launch a “national mission” to forge the “strongest possible future relationship” with the EU.Jeremy Corbyn hits backThe Labour leader said Mrs May’s deal had put the country “over a barrel”, and described it as a “terrible failure of negotiation by this Government”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal left the country ‘over a barrel’ Mr Corbyn said the PM had achieved something “extraordinary” with her Brexit deal: “Across this House it has achieved something – it has united both Conservative Remainers and Conservative Leavers and members of every opposition party in an extraordinary coalition against the deal.”He added: “It is crystal clear that the Prime Minister’s claim that this plan means we take control over our laws, money and borders is utterly far-fetched.”Mr Corbyn said Britain’s trading relationship with Europe was still to be negotiated and it would take years to do that, adding the call for a transition period was a “bridge to nowhere”.He added: “After two years of negotiations all the Government has really agreed to is a very vague wish list.”Divisions in the Tory partyDivisions among the Tory benches were laid bare for all to see in the Commons as former foreign secretary Boris Johnson urged colleagues to reject Mrs May’s Brexit deal and claimed Brussels “think they’ve got us beat”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Boris Johnson was heckled by fellow Tory MPs as he spoke during the debate He was heckled by fellow Tory MPs as he outlined ideas which included renegotiating with the EU and removing the Irish border backstop.The Brexiteer told MPs he did not believe there was a single MP “who sincerely believes this deal we have before us is a good deal”.He said: “The Government’s heart has not appeared to be in this deal and I think listening to those who are sent out to defend it and to explain it, they know it is a democratic disaster.”Tory MP Sir Roger Gale demanded Mr Johnson reveal what his “big idea” was, while Father of the House Ken Clarke, a Tory former chancellor, suggested there was not a “faintest chance” of Mr Johnson’s bid for a renegotiation being taken seriously.Regret from the DUPThe DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds accused the Government of going back on its word during talks with the party over the Brexit deal and attacked the Northern Ireland backstop proposal.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  DUP’s Nigel Dodds also spoke out against the deal Speaking about previous guarantees over the whole of the UK leaving the customs union, he said: “Quite frankly a lot of people in Northern Ireland feel that the Government, the Prime Minister, the pledges that were made have not been honoured.“We’re sad about this, I deeply regret it. I admire the Prime Minister, her stamina, her resilience, the work that she’s doing – but on this I think she has misjudged the mood of the country and the mood of the House.”Frankenstein’s monster The first day of debates came to an end shortly after Labour former minister David Lammy roused MPs with a late-night speech.He said: “Theresa May’s deal has emerged as a Frankenstein’s monster – an ugly beast that no-one voted for or wanted… The deal does not take back control, it gives it away.”What will happen on day two MPs are expected to resume the debate in the early afternoon on Wednesday.Ministers are also expected to set out how the highly sensitive legal advice provided to the Cabinet by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox on the withdrawal deal will be made public."},{"url":null,"title":"geoffrey cox attorney generals booming voice grabs twitters attention","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The inexplicable scoring of severely disabled people has also caused considerable and understandable public anger.“As well as challenging the department on this situation, Sinn Féin is also calling for both the Public Services Ombudsman and the Auditor General to probe the way the assessments are being carried out because it is our view that the department and Capita are failing in their duty of care to vulnerable people.“A Sinn Féin delegation met with the Ombudsman  and had a positive discussion about the possibility of a unilateral investigation being launched.“We welcome the fact that the Ombudsman is now exploring the possibility of launching such an investigation because it is absolutely clear that the roll-out of PIP assessments needs to be probed and these cruel and unnecessary checks brought to an end.”"},{"url":null,"title":"u2 drummer bbc presenter join hosts celebrities campaign save","story":"Thousands of people, including high-profile celebrities such as Larry Mullen from U, have signed a petition aimed at preserving an ancient woodland in Derry.The petition was set-up by George Mclaughlin and Damien Martin of the Prehen Historical and Environmental Society with support from BBC presenter and conservationist, Chris Packham.He and around , others are adamant that planning approval should not be granted for any future development at the Prehen Woods site ‘ever again’.Protestors have fought against the development since  in order to preserve the ancient woodland and protect an endangered colony of red squirrels, along with other wildle for future generations.The four houses are situated adjacent to Prehen Woods but a road connecting the new development to Prehen Park had to be constructed which campaigners said resulted in the removal of ‘scores of trees’ from the ancient woodland.A petition was posted on Change.org to highlight the ‘anomalies’ throughout the planning process and ‘disregard’ shown towards the revocation order, Mr McLaughlin said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIt has garnered around , signatures thus far, including those from Chris Packham, wildle TV presenter and conservationist, actress Dame Judi Dench, Larry Mullen of U, James Nesbitt, creator of Derry Girls Lisa McGee and The Undertones.Chris Packham filmed in Derry recently and has taken a great interest in this campaign as well as the wider need to save ancient woodlands.In a statement, Mr Packam, pictured above with local campaigner George McLaughlin, said there had a ‘catastrophic failure’ in terms of accountability in relation to the plans.“This is not just about four houses and one beautul old wood full of bluebells and wonderful wildle,” he said, “this is about a catastrophic failure in the accountability of politicians, greed and idiotic short-termism. “We must preserve space, green space for the benefit of future generations, space which benefits our physical and mental health, space to ensure that we can retain the al ecosystems we rely upon to produce our food and other resources. “To progress here would spit in the face of democracy, tarnish the reputation of the council forever and ruin the sanctity of a precious part of our planet and set a precedent for a cascade of further abuses of power.”"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOFxcXC8xMlxcXC8wNDE0MjQ0MVxcXC9DQ0kucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjY0NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjM0MCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmRlcnJ5bm93LmNvbVxcXC9hc3NldHNcXFwvaVxcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmc_dj0xXCJ9IiwiaGFzaCI6IjVjZWVjYmFlOWE2MGU1M2U5YjgxODU1NzcwNDhjNWU0YTY2NTE2YzAifQ==/cci.png","title":"voting now open final shortlist derrys 12 windows christmas","story":"Voting is now open for the annual  windows of Christmas competition where local businesses are recognised for the effort they put into their festive window displays.The competition, run by the City Centre Initiativehas now been whittled down to the  and voting is now open.They are -

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint.

Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -.

A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme. People in Saintfield are looking for answers to questions they have on the future development of the town. This is an extremely serious issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9069177.jpg","title":"yacht club claim proposed new boathouse site by rnli would be a waste of donations","story":"Lough Erne Yacht Clubhas accused the RNLI of changing its mind over a proposed site for the building of a new boathouse and have claimed that the project would be a ldquowaste of donations.The LEYC has hosted the RNLI temporary boathouse on its site for the past  years but says that the proposed new site would ldquohave a detrimental effect on the club and sailing in the bay.Now, however, the RNLI has made a planning application for a new leboat station at Gublusk Bay and in a letter to members, seen by the Impartial Reporter, the LEYC has said that it will be objecting.In its letter, by Commodore John Carton, the LEYC has said that it is ldquodisappointed that the RNLI have decided to go ahead with their application to build a boathouse on the shore of Gublusk Bay.The letter goes on to say that the situation is ldquoespecially disappointing since the RNLI were originally given a site one mile away which would give them more visibility.In a statement the RNLI said: ldquoThe RNLI have submitted a planning application for the building of a new leboat station for Enniskillen RNLI, comprising a boathouse and associated facilities, including the erection of slipway, installation of holding tank, landscaping and associated site and access works on a site at Gublusk Bay. It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Born the son of Delia and Andy  years ago in Black’s Court Lurgan, Joe was the third generation of an Italian family who came here in the early th century.Fr McConville said: “They integrated into the community through business, primarily their restaurant and ice-cream parlour which was a feature of Lurgan and known across the country.”He spoke of Joe meeting and marrying the love of his le, Angela O’Hagan, and the couple’s two children Lisa and Maria. And the family grew with Brian Lennon coming into the family and the birth of the grandchildren Delia, Meabh and Niall.“Joe had great love for them and loved to be in their company. He was a great family man.”A packed St Paul’s Church heard the priest say there that many facets to Joe - the question was ‘where do you start’.“History is peppered with characters and some characters are larger than le, some characters can be legends and myths. Cafollas are part of the history of this town and Joe is part of that history.“Joe was a constant figure there in Cafollas. Going into the Carnegie St cafe was always great craic, particularly with the two characters Joe and Brendan Gilmore who could have taken the mickey out of you. The two of them worked together for  years.Joe was a very generous soul and the priest spoke of how he had sometimes gone to Cafollas and Joe would insist on giving him a tub of his famous ice cream. “Many people experienced Joe’s generosity over the years,” he said.\"  \"  School children witness fatal shooting of man outside N.I. school Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He spoke of how Angela introduced Joe to Clann na Gael and he became a regular at matches and post match celebrations, singing a few songs, messing about and tomfoolery’.“Joe loved sports, soccer, football, clay pigeon-shooting and he did a bit of horse-riding. He was always involved in a lot of sports.“I remember Joe over  years ago in the LCA . Joe loved to play snooker. He was always great fun. He also loved boxing and trips to Las Vegas,” said Fr McConville.“Joe was always great company to be in. You always had a great commentary, great camaraderie and great comedy.“With some peopleyou are in their company they could drain you. That certainly was not the case with Joe Cafolla.“Joe gave you le and energy because he was full of le himself, such a jovial character. He energised you and lted you up. He was a great guy to be in his company.“Joe had a great love of le and for his family. Joe was a larger than le character. He was a bit of a showman,” he said recalling stories of Joe and his unusual tactics playing snooker.“One thing everyone says about Joe, he was a kind and he was one of a kind.”His passing is very deeply regretted by his loving we, Angela, daughters, Maria and Lisa son-in-law, Brian, grandchildren, Delia, Meabh and Niall, Maria’s partner Aidy and family circle.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This will enable those who canrsquot make the Valersquos Daytime meeting to be informed and wersquoll offer help and explanationsneeded.ldquoItrsquos vitally important everyone makes their comments loud and clear in writing to the Vale Council at this time.ldquoWe need to drive home that a by-pass option is accepted through to the next stage of the process. It will be no use people moaning later.ldquoOf course multi-modal proposals can have their place but it is unrealistic to suggest they would ever solve the traffic congestion problem through Dinas Powys without a by-pass and without better park and ride facilities.ldquoBuses are currently used by just two per cent of commuters. Itrsquos no use putting more on the roads without removing some of the current commuting traffic, he said.ldquoDespite all the talk of rail and tram improvements there isnrsquot any scope to increase the minimal park-and-ride facilities at Eastbrook and none at all at Dinas Powys.After the Public Consultation, the WelTAG Draft Stage  Report will go to the Vale Cabinet.Members will probably ask their Scrutiny Committee for Environment and Regeneration to give their opinion.The Steering Group is also seeking to engage Ken Skates AM, Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Transport in talks that could involve private sector developments to help fund a by-pass.But theyrsquove been put on hold awaiting the Stage  report. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I admire the Prime Minister, her stamina, her resilience, the work that shersquos doing ndash but on this I think she has misjudged the mood of the country and the mood of the House.Frankensteinrsquos monster The first day of debates came to an end shortly after Labour former minister David Lammy roused MPs with a late-night speech.He said: ldquoTheresa Mayrsquos deal has emerged as a Frankensteinrsquos monster ndash an ugly beast that no-one voted for or wantedhellip The deal does not take back control, it gives it away.What will happen on day two MPs are expected to resume the debate in the early afternoon on Wednesday.Ministers are also expected to set out how the highly sensitive legal advice provided to the Cabinet by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox on the withdrawal deal will be made public..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: What we learned from day one of the Brexit debates article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Burnt out houses remain un-cleared sitting beside those that are still inhabited creating an atmosphere of dereliction and a breeding ground for rats and other vermin. Walkaways between houses have not been cleaned and neither have communal car parking areas.“Houses are in a poor state of repair with garden fences rotting and broken and window frames that have not been upgraded and are beginning to rot. Where it is clear some of these homes are private dwellings the question needs to be askedthere is any form of grant available to those occupants andso what efforts have been made to ensure they know about them.A derelict part of Craigavon“Without a doubt Legahory Court and Burnside are some of the most deprived areas not only in Central Craigavon but throughout the whole of Upper Bann. Those that live there must feel that they have been forgotten by the authorities and dare I say it politicians. If this situation was in central Lurgan, Portadown or Banbridge there would be an outcry from local civic leaders and community groups that would enable change, yet Legahory Court and Burnside remain forgotten, derelict and in need of serious investment. “As more and more money is invested in Craigavon improving the wealth and lives of all those in the area through jobs and wellbeing it is important that the ink spot of investment reaches these deprived areas. In calling for an urgent meeting of those responsible for this area I want to see something that will fundamentally change this area in the medium to long term.”Kate Evans said: “I have never seen anywhere in the local area in such a bad state of repair as I did while walking around Legahory Court and Burnside. As a mother I would have real concern letting my daughter out to playI resided there and genuinely believe that the poor state of some of the homes leaves the places looking like a slum. Yet nomore than  meters away millions of pounds is being spent on infrastructure projectsto improve the aesthetics of central Craigavon, to help with health, wellbeing, job opportunities and a better standard of living for the whole area.”Parts of Craigavon are poorly maintained says UUP MLA Doug Beattie£.m boost to deal with winter ailments Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
