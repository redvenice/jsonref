Previously, frog amber had been unearthed in Mexico and Dominica, but those findings were from the more recent Cenozoic Era between 20 million and 30 million years ago, said Dr Xing, an associated professor from China University of Geosciences, Beijing.Dr Xing also explained to MailOnline that those rare fossils were from a new species that had been unknown to scientists before.The findings indicate that cold-blooded frogs lived in an area much wider than what researchers previously believed in temperate climates during the Cretaceous Period, according to the research team.The stones are also said to be the first collection of amber containing frogs from Myanmar\u0027s Hukawng Valley, a region known for its rich amber deposits. Dr Xing and his colleagues studied a total of four pieces of amber.The largest amber was given to the research team by Chinese amber collector, Li Mo. Ms Li bought the stone from a Myanmar vendor in 2013.The other three pieces were discovered by Dr Xing and his colleagues at markets in Myanmar between 2015 and 2016.The largest piece contains frog remains measuring 2.2 centimetres (0.87 inches) long. The frog\u0027s skull, spine and most of its limbs have been preserved.The frog is believed to be a young frog less than two years old, judging by the fact that some of the bones in its ears and around its wrists had not been fully developed, said another member of the research team Edward Stanley.Dr Stanley, from the Florida Museum of Natural History, called the fossil highly valuable because the frog is likely to have lived on the tree, therefore it would be difficult for its body to survive for such a long time.The second specimen is seven millimetres (0.28 inches) long and comprises the majority of the frog\u0027s body, except for its head. The rest two pieces preserve the limbs of two frogs.  Researchers from China and the United States obtained a total of four pieces of amber (right). Remains of the frogs are well preserved by the stones (left is one of them) and closely studied          The four pieces of amber were first discovered in Hukawng Valley in northern MyanmarResearchers have managed to understand the anatomy the species after putting the amber through 3-D CT scans.The examination gave researchers unprecedented, detailed insights into the bone structure of the animals. With the information in hand, scientists managed to illustrate the frog\u0027s likely appearance using computer-generated imagery.Dr. David Blackburn, another researcher from the team, told MailOnline that it was \u0027exhilarating\u0027 to hold these small fossils up to the light and see the small skeletons within.Dr. Blackburn is an evolutionary biologist specialised in frogs at the Florida Museum of Natural History. He said his role in the project was to scan and describe the fossils.He explained these ancient frogs would have been similar to modern-day frogs such as fire-bellied toads and midwife toads, adding that all toads are in fact types of frog. However, Dr. Blackburn also said that the fossils are missing important parts, such as the frogs\u0027 hips and pelvis, and this has posed challenge for the researchers to make more detailed comparisons between the ancient frogs and other known species.           The ancient frog species has been compared to the modern day fire-bellied toads (pictured)          They are also said to be similar to midwife toads (pictured) which are found in most of EuropeThe newly discovered species has been named Electrorana Limoae. \u0027Electrorana\u0027 is a combined word of \u0027amber\u0027 and \u0027frog\u0027 in Latin while \u0027Limoae\u0027 pays tribute to Li Mo, the amber collector who gave the largest gemstone to the scientists. The species could have lived in ponds near the Hukawng Valley and fed on mosquitoes, beetles, spiders and other creatures that didn\u0027t have a backbone.Dr. Blackburn said it is exciting to find direct evidence of ancient frogs living in wet tropical forests. \u0027While frogs today live throughout the wet tropics, we have little evidence of this association from the fossil record.\u0027Humid and hot northern Myanmar is renowned for its deposits of amber. Many animals and plants from the Cretaceous Period became trapped in tree sap and have been kept until today.Dr Xing Lida has previously led a separate research team to discover an incredibly well-preserved ancient bird trapped in amber from 98.97 million years ago.The animal was dubbed the \u0027pancake bird\u0027 by Dr Xing because it is thin, and is so far the most complete specimen of an ancient bird found stuck inside amber. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/13/11/4D1F002300000578-5838857-image-a-3_1528886220929.jpg","title":"What Karl Stefanovic net worth","story":"     Karl Stefanovic attends the Witchery x OCRF White Shirt Campaign Launch 2018 in SydneyWho is Karl Stefanovic?Born on August 12, 1974 in Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Karl Stefanovic studied journalism at university before taking up a position with TVNZ as a reporter for One Network News in New Zealand. In 1998, Kark returned to Australia and worked for Ten News in Brisbane.Two years later he moved to the Nine Network and started out as a reporter and back-up presenter for National Nine News. After covering the Warragamba bushfires, he was given a role to Nine’s Sydney newsroom.Stefanovic went on to replace Today host Steve Liebmann in 2005 and still presents the show to this day. Karl has also filled in on A Current Affair and participated on Torvill and Dean’s Dancing on Ice. He also worked on Carols by Candlelight and is a reporter on 60 Minutes.He met Cassandra Thorburn in 1995 and they later married, having three children together before separating after 21 years. Their orce was finalised in October 2017.          Stefanovic went on to replace Steve Liebmann in 2005 and still presents Today to this dayKarl Stefanovic and Jasmine YarbroughAfter meeting on a Sydney Harbour boat cruise in December 2016, Karl Stefanovic and Jasmine Yarbrough were seen kissing the following February and their romance was confirmed. A year later, the pair were engaged despite claiming to take things slowly.\u0027We are taking things really, really slowly. I certainly did not expect to meet someone five months after I broke up with my wife. That was not planned. I met her on a boat in Sydney. We have a really lovely relationship, but it\u0027s got to be slow for a variety of reasons,\u0027 Karl said.They made their first appearance at the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week and spent time together in Bora Bora and Mexico, where Karl met Jasmine’s parents for the first time. However, many slammed Karl’s quick move from Cassandra to Jasmine, including former KIIS FM radio host Meshel Laurie.The radio host blasted their displays of affection as ‘insensitive’ and ‘shameless’. \u0027It feels a little insensitive, obviously I don\u0027t know these people. Is it criminal? No. Is it illegal? No, is it a bit bloody shameless and rotten? Maybe.’           Cassandra Thorburn and Karl Stefanovic attend the Global Illumination Gala Dinner 2008In the marriage that lasted over 21 years, Cassandra seemed to act as the traditional mother and wife and would ‘struggle to re-establish her career, following two decades of standing loyally by her husband’s side as a somewhat “traditional wife and mother”.’After their separation, it was rumoured that Stefanovic had agreed to a ‘orce financialproperty settlement’ and from the deal, Karl received $500,000 (£284,000) out of the couple’s combined net worth of $6.5 million (£3.7m) as well as his Mercedes Benz car. Cassandra got the remaining $6 million (£3.4m), 92 per cent of the asset pool.Creek, a managing director and special counsel in orce law, believed that Cassandra is able to enter the workforce and earn the same as her ex-husband. ‘Perhaps Mr Stefanovic is shortly to inherit a large fortune. Maybe he is heading off to the United States, where sports commentators earn more money than President Trump and all his children combined,’ he said.What and when is Eid al Fitr 2018?

It was ruled the boy can return home with his care supervised by social services.Analysing the 44-page witness statement from a Carmarthenshire county Council social worker, Mr Justice Mostyn described the evidence as \u0027very long on rhetoric\u0027 but \u0027very short\u0027 on examples of \u0027deficient\u0027 parenting.  Speaking at the Family Division of the High Court in London, Mr Justice Mostyn said it was \u0027very hard\u0027 to pin down what exactly the social services had \u0027against\u0027 the mother.He said: \u0027The local authority\u0027s evidence in opposition to the mother\u0027s application was contained in an extremely long, 44-page, witness statement made by the social worker.\u0027          The case was heard at the The Royal Courts of Justice todayHe added: \u0027This witness statement was very long on rhetoric and generalised criticism but very short indeed on any concrete examples of where and how the mother\u0027s parenting had been deficient.\u0027 The social worker had been asked to \u0027identify her best example\u0027 of the mother failing to meet the boys emotional needs - to which she replied citing that she had not given him ice cream. \u0027Her response was that until prompted by the local authority mother had not spent sufficient one-to-one time with (the boy) and had failed on one occasion to take him out for an ice cream,\u0027 said the judge.\u0027This struck me as utterly insubstantial criticism.\u0027He added: \u0027A further criticism in this vein was that the mother had failed to arrange for (his) hair to be cut in the way that he liked.

Barrett, the US Army Corps of Engineers bought the steamboat in late 1923, two years after the 124-foot-long boat had been constructed at a cost of $145,000 (£108,000) at the Howard Shipyard in Jeffersonville, Indiana.The vessel was used by the Army Corps for 24 years, to cruise inland waters.

Under foliage, the former towboat and floating restaurant lies abandoned on the shore. In the 1950s the second deck was partially enclosed with wood panels and jalousie windows          Peeling paint can be seen on the walls of the boat, which is also being overtaken by weeds at Deer Park, Louisiana. In 1981 the entire hull was filled with special foam to prevent further deterioration of the vessel. Estimates around that time indicated that over $725,000 would be needed to rehabilitate the Barrett into a first class restaurant and boutiqueIn 1942, the commander in chief inspected certain strategic industrial and military sites related to the war effort via the Mississippi River. But information on these trips, which included a visit to Camp Shelby, was not publicized at the time, for security reasons. It also was employed as a towboat for hauling rock and lumber to sites for revetment work. In 1945 the Barrett carried a group of important officials and dignitaries on an inspection tour of the Mississippi River between Minneapolis and Cairo.          The floor is pocked with holes as the elements continue to take a toll on the derelict boat. The Mamie S. Barrett, built in 1921 as the flagship vessel for the Barrett Towboat and Barge Line Company, is significant as a rare surviving form of riverboat transportation and for its historical association with the Howard Brothers Ship Yards of Jeffersonville, Indiana          During the vessel\u0027s relatively long period of service on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers (1921-1949), riverboat transportation and technology underwent a period of great transition, passing from the age of steam powered sternwheelers into the modern era of propeller driven, diesel powered vesselsAnd before it was dumped on the shore and left to decay over 30 years ago, the vessel underwent various conversions.The Barrett has been a floating clubhouse, restaurant and, during the 1980s, a showboat with a 120-seat theater on the main deck. The boat, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, was bought to be used as a casino boat three decades ago. But that never eventuated, reports steamboats.org.In the 1990s, having survived two floods, the boat was donated to the town of Rosedale, but it had no use for the vessel.          Although a substantial number of sternwheelers had been built during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, very few still survive          The Mamie S. Barrett was launched at the Howard Yards on August 11, 1921, making her maiden voyage to Cincinnati two weeks later in tow of the J. D. LanePlans to restore it have failed to materialize and last year, when the Mississippi River rose to the area it had been left to rot, the Mamie S. Barrett caught fire and was mostly destroyed.Documenting changes since that fire in a haunting series of photos, artist and photographer Skyler Brown, of Sacramento, California, said he was drawn to the vessel after \u0027hearing rumors of a large abandoned steamboat somewhere along the Mississippi River.\u0027\u0027I\u0027ve been documenting abandoned locations around the world for several years now,\u0027 he added.Woman spots takeaway delivery driver ripping CROSS from her front doorMoment Mhairi Black appears to pick her nose on live TVAerial footage shows the area of Beachy Head cliff in East SussexShocking moment group attack man and hit him over the head with brickShocking video as construction workers build road over sleepy dogLondon driver caught eating a bowl of cereal while behind the wheelMan slaps woman who \u0027refused to give him his seat\u0027 on tubeRussian spoons are made the official World Cup instrumentsDad puts woman in chokehold after she punches his daughterShocking moment mass brawl breaks out after two tourists square off    The Barrett and other sternwheel towboats such as the Loretta Howard, long considered the standard of the period, were two of only 17 sternwheel towboats built at the Howard Yards after 1920          As a result of the Depression, the Barrett Line sold the towboat in 1937 to the Army Corps of Engineers Office in Florence, Alabama. The Barrett was transferred to the St. Louis District and renamed the motor vessel Penniman, in honor of William H. Penniman, an employee of the St. Louis Office from 1891 to 1934          In 1945 the Barrett carried a group of important officials and dignitaries on an inspection tour of the Mississippi River between Minneapolis and Cairo\u0027Any time I travel somewhere I research the region beforehand to find forgotten locations that are off the beaten path. \u0027There wasn\u0027t much information online about the boat or its location, but after scouring satellite imagery I found what I suspected was the boat.

In 2016, she announced her reelection bid and said that her priorities were affordable housing as well as environmental health and public transport.After the death of Mayor Ed Lee, London Breed became the acting mayor by virtue of her role as President of the Board of Supervisors. In 2018, Mark Farrell was selected to serve in the interim until the election.          London Breed campaigns with Senator Scott Weiner in downtown San Francisco, CaliforniaLondon Breed mayorDuring a time in which African-Americans are becoming increasingly scarce in the US city, London Breed was declared the winner of the race to become mayor of San Francisco.After eight days of counting, Breed built up a lead in the 250,000 ballots that were tallied and won by 2,177 votes, with only 6,700 left to count.After her win, London revealed that her election sends a message to San Francisco’s youth, especially to those, like herself, are growing up poor.‘No matter where you come from, no matter what you decide to do in life, you can do anything you want to do. Never let your circumstances determine your outcome in life,’ Breed said.She will take office next month and will also be the second woman to be elected mayor in the history of San Francisco, after US Senator Dianne Feinstein. Breed has vowed to represent all of the city and lead the parts that are economically thriving but mired in homelessness and unaffordable homes.London also said that she would get rid of the homeless tent camps within a year of taking office, before she will need to run in November 2019 after completing Ed Lee’s term, which ends in early 2020.The city has an unusual ranked choice voting system that allows voter to pick their top three candidates for mayor. This means that as votes are being counted, second-place and third-place choices are also tallied.Ahead of the election, Mark Leno and Jane Kim asked supporters to pick the other as their second choice in order to block London Breed from winning entirely, saying that she represented what had made San Francisco so inequitable, despite all being Democrats.          Former state Senator Mark Leno speaks to reporters in San Francisco ahead of the electionThis portrayal as a lackey for big business affected Breed and she said: ‘I ask people to not attribute what I\u0027ve done — my success and how hard I\u0027ve worked — to not reduce that or attribute that to someone else,’ Breed told the AP in a pre-election interview.At City Hall, she paid homage to her late grandmother and said she probably had a hand in her win. ‘She took care of the community, she took care of me even on days when I didn\u0027t deserve it, and so being here in her honor means so much,’ she said.What and when is Eid al Fitr 2018?

Yet, I woke up with implants, which I had never signed for in the consultations with the surgeon. At this point, I felt shocked and very upset and frustrated as it was completely unexpected.\u0027Following the surgery Donna, who has a son and a daughter, sought medical help several times for severe pain and swelling in her breasts and, for understandably, suffering a significant psychological reaction.She finally underwent corrective surgery to remove the implants on 23 February, 2016.However, Ms Finegan-White had to undergo further emergency surgery to remove a blood clot that had developed following the removal of the implants that could have killed her.

However, what was meant to be an operation designed to reduce the risk of Donna being diagnosed with breast cancer ended up causing her much unnecessary distress and suffering.\u0027We now call on the NHS Trust to ensure it learns lessons from Donna\u0027s case and realises the importance of ensuring policies and checks surrounding patient consent are upheld at all times.\u0027A spokeswoman for Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: \u0027We were given consent by the patient for implants in 2014, we did not act negligently and the case was settled in 2016.\u0027We have clear and effective consent processes that are followed across the Trust, which outline the risks that patients may face during and after any surgery, including the common risk of blood clots.

Orbán\u0027s government has proposed legislation which would criminalise the act of helping asylum-seekers\u0027We do what we have to do, we are not criminals,\u0027 she said.The government says the laws are aimed at persons helping undeserving migrants to acquire refugee status, for example if those persons were not in immediate danger before entering Hungary, or who entered the country illegally.Named after the liberal Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, the measures are the government\u0027s latest broadside against the 87-year-old, who has long been accused by the fiercely anti-immigration Orbán of facilitating migration into Europe.The run-up to a parliamentary election in April, which Orbán\u0027s ruling Fidesz party won by a landslide, was dominated by anti-migrant and anti-Soros messaging on pro-government media.After the vote, Orbán vowed to clampdown on NGOs, whose staff he called \u0027Soros mercenaries\u0027.According to Marta Pardavi, co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a group providing free legal aid to asylum-seekers, Stop Soros is meant \u0027to stigmatise, intimidate, and sanction human rights defenders\u0027 work\u0027.The measures are \u0027unacceptable,..and should have no place in a democratic country that is run by the rule-of-law\u0027, Pardavi told the press conference.The UNHCR refugee agency has also called on the government to withdraw the plans.They \u0027would significantly restrict the ability of NGOs and iniduals to support asylum-seekers and refugees\u0027, it said in a statement.The EU\u0027s rights watchdog, the Venice Commission, has also begun a probe into the laws\u0027 compliance with EU values, and is due to give its opinion later in June.The NGOs have pledged to use all legal means to challenge the legislation, depending on the final version approved by parliament, including bringing cases before the Hungarian constitutional court and the EU courts. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/13/4D38953C00000578-5843961-image-a-62_1528980142955.jpg","title":"Cambridge UKs Dutch style roundabout gives right way cyclists","story":"      Cambridge is set to build a £1million roundabout that gives right of way to cyclists and pedestrians, meaning drivers will be the lowest priority at the busy junction           New funding will transform the Fendon Road and Queen Edith\u0027s Way roundabout to improve safety and construction work is due to begin in 2019Elderly man on mobility scooter causes havoc on dual...Shocking moment driver speeds around a roundabout with his...Share this articleCambridge ided over UK\u0027s first ever Dutch-style roundabout to built in the city - Cambridge News"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/14/4D2F3F0F00000578-5844105-image-a-68_1528981985183.jpg","title":"Who win 2018 World Cup Psychic animals predict winners","story":"    Achilles the cat, from St Petersburg, was asked to choose between two bowls of food featuring the Saudi and Russian flags          After choosing Russia the cat was bundled into its own personalised Russian football shirt          Achilles then posed for the cameras next to a Russian flag and football on Tuesday afternoonThis year the feline, whose day job is catching mice at the St Petersburg\u0027s Hermitage Museum, was offered two bowls of food with the flags Russia and Saudi Arabia over each.And to the content of the gathered Russian and international media, Achilles stayed faithful to the motherland - predicting a Russian victory in the tournament opener against Saudi Arabia this evening. Elsewhere in the world, Nelly the eight-year-old African elephant, took part in a spectacular penalty shootout at the Serengeti Park zoo in Hodenhagen, northern Germany on Thursday.The enormous beast was presented with two goals marked with the flags of Germany and Mexico and after slotting a sublime finish between the left-hand sticks - plumped for a German win in their opening group match.According to the zoo\u0027s staff, Nelly has a hit-rate of more than 90 per cent, since her first appearance as the zoo\u0027s official soccer oracle during the Women\u0027s World Cup in 2011.

It finally walked towards the national flag of Portugal and ate a banana there, the report said. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/15/05F8B1B1000003E8-5844203-image-a-47_1528986748265.jpg","title":"Who Jack Brooksbank Princess Eugenies fiance revealed ahead Royal Wedding","story":"    Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank pose in the Picture Gallery at Buckingham PalaceWho is Jack Brooksbank?Born May 3, 1986 and once nicknamed ‘barman Jack’, Princess Eugenie’s husband-to-be has worked his way up through some of London’s bars and nightspots, after spurning university and embarking on a career in the hospitality business.Despite being known as a party animal, Jack Brooksbank has put his best foot forward when it comes to entrepreneurship and set up a wine merchants business. He is also an ambassador for Casamigos tequila, part-owned by actor George Clooney.Jack went to school at Stowe, the renowned £10,000 a term Buckinghamshire school, whose former pupils include the likes of Richard Branson and John Sainsbury. He is also known to be a close friend of Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas.          Princess Eugenie of York and her fiance Jack Brooksbank with her mother Sarah FergusonJack Brooksbank parentsThe son of chartered accountant George Brooksbank and his wife Nicola, Jack is also the great-grandson of Viscount Thomas Coke, a former Earl of Leicester and peer in the 19th century.However this Viscount, who died in 1909, is also the great, great-grandfather of Eugenie’s mother, Sarah Ferguson. This means that Eugenie and Jack are actually distant cousins.Princess Eugenie and Jack BrooksbankPrincess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank met during a skiing holiday in Verbier, Switzerland back in 2012 and a friend recalled that there was ‘an immediate attraction’. However, their relationship has not been easy with Eugenie studying in Newcastle and Jack working in London when they met.\u0027She is very uncomplicated. She\u0027s a doer, a worker, as is Jack. They are very suited. Jack\u0027s always worked hard. He chose not to go to university so that he could get on the career ladder and Eugenie loved that. She didn\u0027t care at all that he was a waiter. She might be a princess, but Eugenie comes with few airs and graces,’ a friend said.In 2013, when Eugenie moved to New York City to work at the Paddle8 auction house, their relationship was tested but they remained together. Two months after their relationship became long-distance, Brooksbank told the Daily Mail: \u0027We spend a lot of time on Skype. It\u0027s great. We are still very much together.\u0027Eugenie moved to the UK in 2015 and started working at the Saville Row art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth. After months of rumours, Jack proposed in Nicaragua and she accepted.          Princess Eugenie wears a ring containing a padparadscha sapphire surrounded by diamondsWhen is Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank’s wedding?Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank will tie the knot on October 12, 2018 at St George’s Chapel in Windsor. The date was revealed by Prince Andrew, the Duke of York and Eugenie’s father on Twitter.\u0027The marriage of Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie to Mr Jack Brooksbank will take place on 12th October 2018. As previously announced, the wedding will take place at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle,’ the tweet read.How did Jack Brooksbank make his money?Although Jack Brooksbank’s net worth has not been made public, it is known that his work in the hospitality business has been fruitful after taking a chance and not following his peers into finance degrees and City jobs.After gaining the permission of his parents, he worked as a waiter at Chelsea’s Admiral Codrington and it was here that he met businessman Piers Adam, who encouraged him to work at The Markham Inn, in the same area.Jack began to mingle in Royal circles and got to know Prince Harry and his friend Guy Pelly. He went on to help run Mayfair nightclub Mahiki, one of London’s most exclusive.          Jack Brooksbank and Princess Eugenie of York attend Tracey Emin\u0027s birthday partyBrooksbank was also said to be a stabilising influence on Eugenie, once considered a ‘party princess’ and they have both cut down on clubbing as they have grown older. After getting to know the business, Jack became a brand ambassador for Clooney’s Casamigos tequila.This move was considered to be tactical and to make him seem more respectable ahead of his potential welcome into the Royal Family. Jack also said that he intended to open a chain of pubs and hostelries.In 2013, he said: \u0027I want to create a chain of pubs. It has been my dream since I was 18. I have fond memories of Sunday roasts in pubs with log fires, and it’s something I want to recreate. I love pubs and often go to my local for a pint.\u0027What and when is Eid al Fitr 2018?

This is really desperate - the fact they are asking for office supplies and toilet paper.\u0027As a parent, if the school is begging for toilet paper then it makes you wonder what\u0027s next.\u0027Ms del Campo says the new National Funding Formula, which was designed to iron out discrepancies in the way funding was applied to schools, is seriously underfunded if schools are begging for essential items.She said: \u0027It doesn\u0027t sit right with me that the Government can find £50million for grammar schools when others are begging for toilet paper.\u0027The £50million fund, announced in May, is for selective schools that can prove their commitment to admitting disadvantaged pupils.Kate Foreman, business manager at St Edmund Campion, said this is the first year the school has received less funding from the Education Funding Agency than the previous year.  Mrs May has represented the constituency of Maidenhead for 21 years. In March, she told the House of Commons that the Government was spending more on schools \u0027than ever before\u0027She added that a further £70,000 had been lost due to the Government\u0027s decision to cut the Education Services Grant.Academies and councils stopped receiving the grant last September.Mrs Foreman said she is uncertain what the future holds for the school which has around 420 pupils aged four to 11.She said: \u0027We\u0027re still committed to providing our children with an outstanding education but there\u0027s only so much you can do. Financially we\u0027re OK this year, and the next two years will probably be fine but any longer than that is harder to evaluate.\u0027It\u0027s certainly got more difficult over the last few years.\u0027The Government has defended the funding it provides for schools.Detailing the new National Funding Formula in July last year, then Education Secretary Justine Greening said it will be a \u0027fairer\u0027 distribution and delivers \u0027higher per pupil funding in respect of every school, and in every local area\u0027.But Angela Rayner, Labour\u0027s Shadow Education Secretary, insists the Government has done nothing to reverse cuts.Speaking earlier this year, she said: \u0027£2.7billion has been cut from the budgets of England\u0027s schools since 2015, and teacher recruitment targets have been missed for the fifth year in a row.\u0027Until this Government gets the basics right, they will never be able to deliver the education that every child deserves.\u0027Other items on St Edmund Campion\u0027s Wish List include plasters, Pritt Sticks, colouring pencils, marker pens, envelopes and lever arch files."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/15/4D3A468500000578-5844323-image-m-66_1528985646086.jpg","title":"Man jumps burning sledge rides flight stairs","story":"The young man tips alcohol into a sledge and sets it on fire with a lighter (left) before jumping in feet-first and riding it down the stairs (right)          Flames can be seen spreading up the walls in the dangerous stunt, which appears to be filmed in the USThe clip ends with the camerawoman laughing as she tries to find her friend - who is wearing jeans and a t-shirt reading \u0027Culture\u0027 - through the fumes. It is not clear whether the pair suffered any injuries from the reckless stunt, or if a much larger blaze was caused.

I have always lived and taught my children to be inclusive. I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.\u0027Barr was none too happy with that statement and fired back on Twitter: \u0027I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!\u0027 she wrote.Fishman responded, stating: \u0027You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that.\u0027Barr fired back: \u0027Please leave me alone, thanks.\u0027  Barr seemed to have made amends with both Gilbert and Fishman after a few days however, writing:  \u0027To michael fishman and sara gilbert: I forgive u both, love u both, just wish u could have called me personally 2 talk rather than do it in a public arena.

When the crescent moon is seen, Eid can begin.Considered one of the most important holidays of the Islamic calendar, Eid has its own particular set of prayers that can only be recited in congregation and often called out in parks, community centres or mosques called the Salat al-Eid.          Iranian men perform the Eid prayers at Tehran University to mark on the religious festivalWhen is Eid al Fitr 2018?Due to the dates of Ramadan varying from one year to another on the Gregorian calendar, Eid is also on a different day each year because it is determined by the lunar calendar.In 2018, Eid al-Fitr will take place on Friday, June 15 after the crescent moon is seen on the evening of June 14 in Saudi Arabia.The time in Saudi Arabia is three hours later than Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and at present, there is a two hour difference between the UK and Riyadh because of British Summer Time (BST).This means that as sunset is predicted for 6.43pm this evening, this would be 4:43pm in Britain. But as astronomers have predicted that the moon will not be visible until the next day, Eid al-Fitr will officially begin on Friday.Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court has requested for Muslims to keep an eye out for the crescent moon and report it to authorities as many Islamic scholars insist on it being visible with the naked eye.          Pakistani worshippers hold prayers for Eid in the Lahore King\u0027s Mosque for the religious festivalHow to celebrate Eid in the UKEvery year, Eid al-Fitr is a big celebration with the Salat al-Eid being recited. Muslims will gather at mosques or open-air areas to pray on the first morning before eating breakfast with their family and friends, their first meal in daylight in over a month.Events will also be held in London’s Trafalgar Square and Birmingham’s Small Heath Park to mark the start of the new month.Muslims also honour Eid by giving to charity and this is referred to as Zakat al-Fitr. Donations will be given to those who are not able to join in the feast and celebrate the breaking of the fast.What and when is Eid al Fitr 2018?

It would also put Parliament in charge of the final stage of the negotiations. Minutes after Mr Grieve left yesterday’s meeting the participants started planning on a campaign for a second referendum to stop Brexit.Mr Rees-Mogg said it was ‘completely improper’ for the Commission to allow its buildings ‘to be used in a domestic political controversy’.‘We fund the EU and it should not use our money to interfere in our domestic affairs,’ he said.Sir Bill Cash, the chairman of the Commons European scrutiny committee, said: ‘It’s clear that Mr Grieve is consorting with those people who are all intent on reversing Brexit.‘It makes his claim that he is trying to be helpful to the Government transparent nonsense.’Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘I’m surprised if he is meeting with a whole load of people whose sole purpose is to stop Brexit when he has said it is not his intention to do so.’      Pictured (from left to right) Patience Wheatcroft, Ros Altmann and Sarah Ludford pictured in Smith Square yesterdayThe ex-editor‘We have to stop Brexit,’ is view of former newspaper editor Patience Wheatcroft, ennobled by David Cameron in 2010.

Most of the other participants left around 1pm, including Baroness Altmann, the anti-Brexit Tory peer, Patience Wheatcroft, the Tory peer and former newspaper editor who has backed a second referendum and has argued ‘we have to stop Brexit’, and the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman in the Lords, Sarah Ludford.They were joined by AC Grayling, the philosopher who has said it was wrong to ‘normalise acceptance of leaving the EU’.The meeting reveals that separate Remainer groups are coordinating to try to stop Britain’s departure from the EU. On Tuesday night Mr Grieve told the Commons he was not trying to prevent Brexit but ‘legitimately looking at the detail of one of the most complex legal and political exercises in which we have ever engaged in peacetime’.In an interview with The Guardian last month, he backed another national poll to ask the public ‘is this what you really want?’ but also claimed he was ‘not working to precipitate it’.

The victim said he was ‘petrified’ by this, the jury heard.Miss Cottage told how King tried to reassure him ‘saying that he could telephone a girlfriend to arrange for her to come over and relieve him of his virginity.’The boy said he wanted to leave, King gave him the tickets and let him go.Share this articleLater he dedicated the song ‘Illegal Alien’ by Genesis to both schoolboys on his Christmas Day radio show.Asked in police interview if he had touched the boy, King quipped: ‘I don’t think I would have done unless he’d asked me very politely.’King, who had a series of top ten hits and hosted TV shows like ‘Entertainment USA’ is accused of sexual offences against 11 victims at Southwark Crown Court.On another occasion King took one of his victims to visit a ‘friend’ at school - a sixth form border.When police raided his home they found a picture pinned up of a blonde boy, signed on the back: ‘To Jonathan, Love X, Nov ‘78.’Police also found a diary detailing sexual exploits with young boys on a trip to Mexico.He speaks of ‘trolling’ and ‘cruising’ to pick up 15 and 16-year-old boys in his car for sex.      King name-dropped stars from the time like comedian Kenny Everett (left) and model Samantha Fox (right), the court was toldHe took the boy to a Chinese restaurant and got him drunk while name dropping Kenny Everett before and then took him back to his home.The prosecutor described how the victim was shown King\u0027s music room and \u0027his next memory was of waking, naked, in the defendant\u0027s bed which had black shiny sheets.After carrying out a sex attack on him, King gave him £5 for a taxi home and he never saw him again.The prosecutor showed jurors a video of King\u0027s home, pointing out a topless picture of 1980s page three model and singer Samantha Fox.\u0027Samantha Fox is someone who the defendant occasionally described as his girlfriend to one or two of these young men,\u0027 she added.One said he was \u0027star struck\u0027 when King pulled up in his car and started speaking to him.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/16/4D3C231200000578-5844831-image-a-72_1528991840216.jpg","title":"Spooky footage captures fridge washing machine open own","story":"    In the spooky footage recorded after midnight late last night and yesterday night, Paul\u0027s kitchen can be seen          Then, without warning, both appliances open just seconds after one another\u0027My partner and I have noticed strange activity in a certain part of our flat\u0027s kitchen.

City services left the raccoon on the side of the road for so long that someone left a note and a rose by the body. Soon, a framed photograph of a raccoon popped up a Sharpie was left to encourage written respects on a card candles and flowers surrounded the corpse. The raccoon was named Conrad. Most people appreciated the offbeat humour in this others complained that the raccoon was being “disrespected”, even though it had a better send-off than many humans.But there can be no ambiguity over the heartwarming tale of what happened to the critter that became known as the MPR raccoon, which has captured the world’s attention over the past couple of days. MPR raccoon (named after Minnesota Public Radio) got stuck on a ledge. Raccoons, which tend to climb upwards when stressed, scaled 23 floors of an office building before getting tired and having a nap on a windowsill. Office workers, powerless behind their sealed-shut windows, took photographs of the raccoon, and cars the size of toys below, and discussed what to do to help.Firefighters set a trap on the roof. Locals gathered under the tower, some brought binoculars. News agencies trained their cameras. But the light was fading. So too, was the raccoon, having not eaten or had a drink for over 24 hours. When darkness came, the raccoon changed tack, and slowly began to descend.I couldn’t sleep. Paris couldn’t sleep. Berlin couldn’t sleep. It was difficult to see how this could end well for the MPR raccoon. It didn’t even matter that raccoons are quite vicious and troublesome animals which Americans frequently refer to as “trash pandas”. The concern was there. But after a night of tossing and turning, I awoke in the morning. And the raccoon had apparently reversed course again, and had … made it to the top, and to safety! Hurrah!It was the good news story we all wanted, and needed. In this geopolitical quagmire we’re living through, there’s never been a greater need for some light relief. It’s why many make fun of Kim Jong-un’s hair, or Donald Trump’s for that matter. Some argue this trivialises issues we should take seriously, which is a point worth arguing, and why I tend to prefer raccoon intrigue.Take Courtney Hadwin, the 13-year-old who wowed America’s Got Talent’s judges with her Joplinesque performance. I don’t even like those shows, but her audition was intensely pleasing. There is even something adorable about the Queen and Meghan Markle visiting Runcorn, the place every young Liverpudlian goes to test the dry ski slope.At the NHS Confederation conference on Wednesday, boss Simon Stevens implored tech companies to do more to fight social media’s negative effect on young people’s mental health. On social media, and perhaps Twitter in particular, the growth in hate speech has been like a pernicious bindweed snuffing out civil debate. Then there’s the social pressures and bullying online. These elements need to be addressed. But good news stories, or even just amusing content, which can go viral on Facebook and Twitter in a matter of minutes, and its subsequent memefication, often has me laughing out loud. At the weekend, Holly Monson tweeted: “Well it was a nice lake day until my dog nearly drowned my sister”, and something about the perfectly chosen shots of her adorable retriever-cum-water-assassin made me howl. And 155,000 others.Some stories aren’t necessarily “good news” stories, but offer an insight into the human condition which isn’t as bleak and despairing as we have come to expect. The London underground driver stopping his tube in tribute to the Grenfell victims and survivors the woman who challenged a racist on a train Mamoudou Gassama, the super-strong dude in Paris who climbed four storeys to save a toddler hanging from a balcony. Psychologists call the effect this has on us “elevation”, as even watching these altruistic or moral acts inspires us to do good ourselves. Jonathan Haidt says that elevation “motivates those who experience it to open up to, affiliate with, and assist others. Elevation makes an inidual feel lifted up and optimistic about humanity.”Studies have shown that positive news stories in general have a good effect on mental health. While, as you’d expect, negative news can make us more depressed and anxious. We also tend to seek out bad news because of our natural “negative bias”, which means we are more alert to stories that might detail a threat.It’s clear from website traffic and social media engagement that plenty of people enjoy the lighter side of the internet – and no, that doesn’t mean that we’re are not paying attention to current affairs. All I know is that watching a live stream of people avoiding a puddle in Newcastle in various creative ways in 2016 (remember #DrummondPuddleWatch?) made it slightly easier to also deal with the fact that Islamic State was raging through Libya, and North Korea was, once again, testing its nuclear weapons on the same day.As for the MPR raccoon. He has just been released back into the wild. Run free little dude. We’re all rooting for you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e219e118ddd468f083b607d230d80c799119647c/0_23_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aed4f7b4b3ff46fd63c0caea6ec2f40","title":"wetherspoons boss tim martin brexiteer champagne","story":"I am so tired of red-faced, middle-aged men telling me Brexit will be fine. Nigel Farage, Arron Banks, Andy Wigmore, Daniel Hannan – they’ve all merged into one super-Brexiteer in my mind, possibly called Edmund, a pint surgically attached to one hand, a phone in the other, typing obscenities with pudgy fingers to tweet to Gina Miller.Tim Martin, the chair of Wetherspoons, is another one of these Edmunds – a constant slight smug smirk on his forever pink-tinged face, which he probably thinks is vaguely alluring but really makes him look like Boss Baby with wind. Martin has announced, in a bluster of Brexit bravado, that Wetherspoons would no longer be selling various wines and beers from France, Italy and Germany, replacing them instead with drinks from the UK, Australia and South Africa. He spoke of the opportunity to “broaden our horizons” in the wake of Brexit, which is one of those beautifully patriotic and nonsensical sentences that makes you want to salute the flag, marry a British bulldog and kick an eastern European immigrant into the Thames.I say nonsensical, of course, because there’s no other way to take this: our horizons are already sufficiently broad under the EU to allow us to get wines from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, that’s why Martin – alongside most supermarkets and restaurants – is importing these drinks now, and not when we leave the EU in 2019 (or 2020, or whenever the EU finally dislodges our fingernails and drags us screaming from the side of the European parliament). He seems to think that most Wetherspoons customers will be looking at the Australian wines with East-Germans-after-the-fall-of-the-Berlin-Wall-style wonder, uttering things like “after years of living under the oppressive EU regime and their strict wine laws, I finally get to sample this £4.99 Jacob’s Creek. Thank you, Brexit, thank you.”Of course it’s not really about “broadening our horizons”. It’s about irritating and infuriating the right kind of people. And in that sense, it’s worked, because upon seeing this headline, I screamed into my crocheted European Union pillow for a solid minute. But it’s also about showing his dedication to the God of Brexit. It’s about showing that Britain can produce enough booze for itself, which is a bit like rejecting something to drink because your mouth can create saliva. The implication – so achingly obvious that it pulses like a vein on Nigel Farage’s head while he’s trying to explain Russian money in the leave campaign – is that if you want any of that foreign stuff, you’re not really British.A real Brit wouldn’t need French champagne, or German beer, or Polish meats – they’d be content with a bowl of gruel and a kick in the teeth as long as it was all made in Stoke. It’s another in a series of tedious cultural battles, another front in the never-ending war between remain and leave, between globalists and isolationists, between elites and people, between bridge-builders and wall-makers. It will not stop – not after we leave the EU, not after Donald Trump leaves office, not after the economy has crashed and burned and we’re all using fidget spinners as currency.It’s not enough to say that the leaders of the “isolationist” movement, who claim to represent the Will of the People, are themselves complicit. No matter how many times you scream that one in 10 of Wetherspoons’ employees were European in 2016, no matter how many times you point out the Russian links back to Farage, back to Banks, no matter how many times you expose the amount of money that prominent Brexiteers are set to make out of betting against the UK, the narrative cannot be stopped: it’s the British people v the elites. And Martin has decreed that the British people don’t want fancy European food and wine – only elites do.No country is an island, really. That’s why most of Shakespeare’s plays are set in continental Europe and not in a suburb of Birmingham. That’s why Premier League football players come from all around the world, and why everyone in Liverpool is secretly supporting Egypt at the World Cup. It’s how we have this weird, wonderful, stupid language in which I’m writing – an amalgamation of German, French, Latin and Scandinavian, meaning we probably sound like a confused papal tourist in an Ikea to every other country.Imagine if we cut the rest of Europe out of our history – we’d have no castles, no delicious French cuisine, no Barbie Girl by Aqua. It’s a truly terrifying thought. Like it or not, we are a European nation, and artificially cutting them out of our lives for some misguided patriotism will only end in a lot of red faces down the line – either out of embarrassment, or because we’ll all have been weathered and browbeaten into hammy-faced Edmunds."},{"url":null,"title":"samantha bee north korea kim jong un late night round up","story":"Late-night comics discussed the Singapore summit and the possibility that Michael Cohen may flip on the presidentLate-night hosts on Wednesday discussed the rumors that Michael Cohen may cooperate with federal prosecutors, the summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, and Bill Clinton’s rocky book tour.“This week Donald Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un,” began Samantha Bee. “It was weird but flirtatious enough to warrant a second date.“Trump even made Kim a prom-posal video,” the host joked, in reference to the melodramatic four-minute movie trailer disseminated by the White House to drum up anticipation for the summit. “The meeting did produce a few concrete items, in that they’re the kind of hollow concrete Trump uses in his trashy hotels.“The president has agreed to give up conducting military exercises on the Korean peninsula,” the host explained. “This may sound like a huge concession from Trump but you have to remember what he said in The Art of the Deal: ‘I’m an idiot.’”Bee then noted that the South Korean government was blindsided by Trump’s commitment to halt joint military exercises and provide safety guarantees to North Korea.“He also announced a freeze on any new US sanctions against North Korea,” Bee added, “because Trump isn’t about to screw North Korea like they’re a bunch of savage Canadians.”Bee concluded: “The supreme leader left the summit legitimized as a nuclear power and glowing brighter than enriched uranium. And all Trump got in return was the same pledge of future denuclearization that North Korea has made and broken numerous time over the last 25 years.”Pointing out the distinction between a pledge to denuclearize and “complete, verifiable, irreversible” denuclearization, Bee said: “It’s kind of like the difference between holding on to your virginity and,” as she held up air quotes, “holding on to your virginity.” Stephen Colbert addressed the possibility that Michael Cohen, the president’s former attorney and fixer, may cooperate with federal investigators as his lawyers prepare to leave the case.“Sources say ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen is likely to cooperate with federal prosecutors,” Colbert said. “Yes, Michael Cohen is going to sing like a canary, which is ironic because it’s Trump that actually looks like one.“The first sign that Cohen is about to flip is that his lawyers are not expected to work with him going forward and replacements for the lawyer has not been named,” the host explained, noting that Cohen has been in legal jeopardy since documents were seized from his home and office in a 9 April FBI raid.“This must be a shock to Donald Trump because it comes at a critical time,” Colbert said, citing a Vanity Fair article. “Sources say Mueller is wrapping up his obstruction of justice investigation or, as one of them put it, it’s going to hit the fan pretty soon.”Cohen, Colbert explained, is considered one of the few people who can “blow up” Trump given their decades-long working relationship. “That gives Cohen leverage,” he added, “because the last guy who threatened to blow up Trump got his own summit.“The question is, will Donald Trump pardon Michael Cohen? Maybe, maybe not,” Colbert said, noting that the president blames Cohen for the ongoing Stormy Daniels saga. “Why did Michael make me have sex with that woman?” the host joked, mocking Trump. “And why did he allow me to be alone with her during Shark Week? He knows it gets my juices flowing.”Finally, Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah, in a segment called “So Much News, So Little Time”, briefly touched on the merger between Time Warner and AT\u0026ampT, the World Cup, and Bill Clinton’s response to a question about Monica Lewinsky.“A federal judge has approved one of the biggest corporate mergers in American history,” Noah began, referring to AT\u0026ampT’s $85bn takeover of Time Warner, which was approved by a federal judge on Wednesday.“Finally, Time Warner and AT\u0026ampT are joining forces,” he added. “This is such great news for consumers because now we can get all of our horrible customer service in one place.”After mentioning this week’s World Cup, and the news that the US, Mexico, and Canada will host the 2026 competition, he went on: “I could spend a lot of time talking about the World Cup but this is America, so I know we’ve got to move on, which I bet is something Bill Clinton wishes the media would do, too.”Clinton, currently promoting his new novel The President is Missing, co-written by James Patterson, was asked about sexual harassment in an interview on NBC.“Norms have really changed in terms of what you can do to somebody against their will,” Clinton said. When asked if he owes Monica Lewinsky an apology, he answered: “No, I never talk to her,” adding that he “did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry”. The former president then said: “Someone should ask you these questions because of the way you formulate the questions.”“What?” Noah replied. “That is one the weirdest moments I’ve ever seen in an interview. He just flipped it and asked the journalist a question. You know who I really feel bad for? President Clinton’s co-author, James Patterson. Think about it: that poor dude just wanted to promote a book but now he has to sit there quietly through every interview and watch the disaster unfold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62902faba76119387c4f07abf1dd603ea9db04c5/0_29_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62ad8928eacc2ff6faea99a48262515c","title":"one new species of micro moth found in britain every year","story":"Experts say almost 30 species of pyralid moths have flown in or been transported via the horticultural trade They are often tiny, frequently brown and always challenging to identify but an average of one new species of pyralid moth each year is turning up in Britain, according to experts.Almost 30 new species of this large family of “micro-moths” have been recorded over the last 30 years – either flying in themselves or being transported via the horticultural trade.While the abundance of moths is in decline, more than 125 new species of moth have been spotted in Britain this century alone, with 27 species establishing themselves as breeding species.People are being urged to spot and help document these new arrivals as part of this year’s Moth Night, an annual three-night event to record and celebrate moths, organised by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology \u0026amp Hydrology and wildlife publisher Atropos.“Just because something is called a micro-moth, don’t assume it’s tiny and brown and dull and impossible to identify because some of these aren’t,” said Richard Fox of Butterfly Conservation. “Moths in general are a fantastic, interesting group of wildlife that’s still relatively erse – there are hundreds of species in your back garden. Anyone who is interested in wildlife will find that exciting and inspiring.”Newly arrived micro-moths include Musotima nitidalis, originally from Australia and New Zealand, which reached Britain in 2009 via the horticultural trade. The moth is now found in several locations in southern England, where its caterpillars feed on ferns such as bracken.Many of the recent pyralid colonists have arrived naturally, probably assisted by climate change, including the beautifully coloured Evergestis limbata, which has settled along the south coast of England.According to Fox, most of the new arrivals are entirely benign although one, the box tree moth, will be unpopular with gardeners for its caterpillars’ habit of devouring the leaves of box hedges.Easy to see native pyralids include the day-flying mint moth, which can be found among garden herbs and the small magpie – a surprisingly large black and white moth. Common migrants include the rush veneer and rusty-dot pearl.The caterpillars of another group of pyralid moth, the china-marks, live in an air-filled bubble of spun leaves, sometimes below the surface of ponds or at the edge of streams.As well as apps and online guides, there is a new guidebook on pyralid moths to help spotters. Mark Tunmore of publisher Atropos said: “New species are being added to the British list with regularity and we want to make sure that people are well equipped to identify these.

I have noticed a decline in the number (and size) of ticks, for example, and houseflies and greenflies – even dung flies – are actually rare this summer.If we do not mourn their decline we are foolish – no flies means no maggots, which means no cleaning up of the dead badgers Packham mentions no greenflies and ticks means less food for some species up the food chain, which is presumably why there are no birds on our feeders these days. It really does feel like an apocalypse, and yet the government still drags its feet over the poisons which have almost\u0026nbspcertainly caused it.Jeremy CushingExeter• There’s nothing “political” in stating facts that anyone can see, or in quoting data anyone can check out. Unfortunately the increase in Green party votes that failed to materialise at the last general election seems to have given both the main parties an excuse to think there are no votes in environmental issues, especially the (urban-based) Labour party. We have got to call them both out – what’s happening is serious!Maggie MossBristol• Two actions we could all take are to stop using herbicides and to get our local councils to do the same. In our village, verges, bottoms of walls, kerbs, playground edges, grounds and walls of our ancient abbey, the churchyard edge and even the SSSI of Poppit Dunes are all subjected to spraying and in some cases strimming as well. Councils are aware that it is detrimental to bees to spray open flowers, although this sometimes occurs. However, they do not seem to realise that killing a plant “down to the root” also kills any insect eggs and larvae that are attached by depriving them of home and food.Carol KuhlmannSt Dogmaels, Pembrokeshire• I was surprised that Chris Packham had seen no wild flowers. Here, the hedgerows are bright with wild roses, gorse and elderflowers.

But this season, they are using some smarter scheduling tacticsWhere will you spend this World Cup? Primarily down the pub, surrounded by pals and beers? Or in the cinema, lapping up chick flicks and chardonnay? If the movie industry is to be believed, it’s a simple choice between the two – hence the phenomenon of counterprogramming.Every so often, canny cinema managers flood the schedules with titles designed to attract anyone desperate to escape summer football tournaments, or whatever apparently alienatingly macho sporting event (see also the Super Bowl) is keeping traditional action fans from the cinema doors.Counterprogramming choices have included glossy comedies such as Sex and the City, which scored enormously during Euro 2008, teen-skewed weepies including The Fault in Our Stars, and the family-friendly fodder of How to Train Your Dragon 2. The latter two were box–office winners during the 2014 World Cup, when the period drama Belle (mixed-race daughter of an admiral helps abolish slavery) also highlighted the opportunities for arthouse crowd-pleasers.Yet the formula isn’t foolproof. That was also the year distributors dangled Grace of Monaco (glamour! tragedy! Nicole Kidman!) in the direction of anyone unexcited by sport. But appalling reviews and word of mouth proved too formidable a defensive backline. Simply chucking A-list ladies and nice jewellery at the screen doesn’t necessarily woo women.Such assumptions are on the way out, hopes Claire Binns, director of programming at cinema chain Picturehouse. “I’m slightly tired of the idea of putting a ‘women’s film’ as counterprogramming,” she says. “Women do watch football.” For Binns, it’s now more about a certain type of quality title. “I’m happy to have Ocean’s 8 and Mamma Mia! 2, but I hope it’s not a case of a bunch of men in the studio offices thinking: ‘Let’s give the girls something to watch.’”Yet Tom Grater, a reporter for the trade magazine Screen, thinks gender-based assumptions persist. “Exhibitors typically brace for a drop-off during an international football tournament. Clearly this year they are making a huge effort to plug any potential gaps with counterprogramming.”The female-fronted heist spin-off Ocean’s 8 is this year’s most obvious attempt to woo supposed World Cup widows. The signs are good: despite moderate reviews, it topped the US box office last weekend. It ticks every box and more: big names, racially erse, with a Bechdel Test-passing plot – and top frocks, too. Trooping off to Ocean’s 8 doesn’t even seem an aggressively anti-sport move.Other forthcoming releases look particularly machine-tooled. Adrift, which helpfully stars the lead actor from The Fault in Our Stars, Shailene Woodley, is a true-story drama co-starring Sam Claflin, who had hearts aflutter as a dapper quadriplegic in Me Before You. For the more mature woman, The Book Shop pairs Emily Mortimer with Bill Nighy for a story involving the establishment of a Suffolk arts centre in 1959. And for those in the market for a Bridget JonesMarley \u0026amp Me cross-breed, here comes Patrick, a romcom featuring a puppy cupid.Meanwhile, fashion documentary McQueen is mining an assumption that interest in couture precludes ownership of a Panini sticker book. While Studio 54, revisiting the history of the hedonistic Manhattan club, suggests someone has a hunch that people only really like one sort of gathering of hot sweaty bodies.Yet two significant titles this year are, encouragingly, a little less on-the-button. First out is Hereditary, released tomorrow, a family-themed movie with Toni Collette in the lead, yes, but also one guaranteed to scare you senseless. Grater suspects changing audience habits mean the gamble will pay off: “Hereditary has had a pretty significant marketing campaign behind it and launching on the second day of the World Cup will serve as a good bit of counterprogramming. It could do very well with a younger female audience – recent statistics say they are biggest audience for horror movies.”The other is Sicario 2, a sequel to the gritty Mexican drug-trade drama, which this time round, while starring Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin, doesn’t also feature Emily Blunt. Stuart Crane, head of programming at Cineworld, puts it front and centre of his counterprogramming hopes, alongside Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Ocean’s 8.“This is an interesting one,” says Grater, “as you’d expect a male-heavy crowd. Clearly, the distributor, Lionsgate, thinks there’s opportunity here.” In fact, they may be erring on the side of pessimism. Sicario 2 is scheduled for release on 29 June – the day before the knockout stage of the World Cup gets under way. “They might be banking on England being out of the tournament by then,” says Grater.

For over 25 years, his gang has hidden behind cars, set up stings and cloaked themselves in disguised just for the thrill of saying: “You’re it.” One guy even got tagged at his dad’s funeral. It’s a true story – the Wall Street Journal profiled the dudes in 2013 – and you can write the scene that comes next. A Hollywood executive spots the headline, grabs the phone and barks: “Get me Ed Helms.”The relentlessly funny comedy Tag pairs the ever-twerpy star of The Hangover with a posse that includes Jon Hamm as an egotistical CEO, Jake Johnson as a sad-sack stoner orcee and Hannibal Buress in his usual part of the underwritten sidekick who steals scenes by mumbling the best jokes. Ever since they graduated and spread east from Spokane, Washington in the 1990s – director Jeff Tomsic clues us into the era with the Toad the Wet Sprocket poster in Helms’ childhood playroom— Hoagie (Helms), Callahan (Hamm), Chilli (Johnson) and Sable (Buress) have spent every May sneaking around and smacking each other on the back. Only each other. Hoagie’s aggressive wife Anna (Isla Fisher) has never gotten to officially play, thanks to a no-girls-allowed rule forged in boyhood. As for fifth player Jerry (Jeremy Renner), the alpha jock has never been tapped. He’s that fast.Tag keeps them young, or at least acting like it until their knees give out vaulting a fire escape. Ironically, it also keeps these competitive best friends at a distance. When Jerry plans his wedding – 31 on May, according to his hard-headed fiancee’s (Leslie Bibb) dream date – he doesn’t even invite his pals. If they attend, they’ll just tackle him at the pulpit. Besides, they’re guaranteed to show anyway. As Hoagie vows: “We get Jerry now or we die. Eventually.”How does the game mesh with their adult lives? Poorly. In an opening scene, Hoagie sabotages Callahan’s big interview with – oh hi! – the Wall Street Journal, who’s managed to be written into the film by recasting original journalist Russell Adams as beautiful blonde Rebecca Crosby (Annabelle Wallis), who impulsively decides to city-hop across America to Jerry’s wedding with these strangers without packing a toothbrush or a personality. Screenwriters Rob McKittrick and Mark Steilen don’t even hammer her into the script as a love interest, making Crosby’s presence so extraneous I kept checking the backseats of cars, expecting the film would forget she’s supposed to be there. Orson Welles might nod that he used the same reporter plot device in Citizen Kane. But for all the great, dumb pleasures of Tag, even the film itself would agree that deciphering why these guys play is even less weighty than Rosebud.Tomsic is aware of the cruelties of the game: the injuries, the trampled bystanders, the lonely geeks who long to join and the PTSD-like paranoia that’s forced Sable into therapy (which he also seems to be directing at his wife who gets mentioned once and forgotten). He’s built out this world to be about more than nostalgia, though there’s plenty of that, too, from cassette tapes to a needle-drop of the 1995 Pharcyde hit Runnin’ that’s so pitch-perfect he plays it twice. (U Can’t Touch This must have been too expensive.) The script cheapens itself squeezing in empty gags about a homophobic – and possibly closeted – receptionist (Thomas Middleditch) and Hoagie’s mom’s (Nora Dunn) inappropriate crush on one of his childhood playmates. (It’s shockingly not Hamm, who here maximizes his elastic eyebrows and cartoonish good looks.) Tag is better when it fumbles for the boundaries of the game. Beyond “amendment B: no ass-punching”, what’s the line between sporting and sociopathic? Is it Chilli’s insistence that Jerry’s wedding is a ruse? Or is it our suspicion that Jerry seems capable of doing exactly that?Tag doesn’t give Tomsic many chances for directorial flair, but when Jerry is in danger of being touched, the cinematography shifts into a thriller. The shadows sharpen, harsh white light rakes against Renner’s pores, and suddenly the Bourne Legacy hero has leaped from comedy back to the battlefield where he belongs. Renner looks like a comic, but this is his first chance to prove he can hang – even if, like Jason Statham in Spy, his misfit seriousness is the joke. He fights both mentally and physically, inviting an ex-girlfriend (Rashida Jones) to the wedding reception as a honeypot trap, and mastering defensive moves that fend off attackers without making skin contact. By the time Tomsic steals a camera move from Sam Raimi’s horror flick The Evil Dead, we’re primed to agree with Sable when he groans: “Our friend is a psychopath and this is scary.”Surprisingly, there’s emotional resonance in this slapstick flick about friends who are terrified to hug. Add that to the solid chemistry between the leads, and Tag is a fine callback to the sprawling ensemble comedies of the 1980s, back when the real-life tag team graduated high school. It’s a solid summer film that will melt away from memory by fall. Though, if it does well, you can guarantee that the studio that churned out three Hangovers is hoping for a sequel. After all, this game never ends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f4b6fe53f46e2fe18d3f4c907a61fcdb3032153/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00ec5de2c8610f08c7d3196987d0f383","title":"adidas nike world cup who wins","story":"Adidas is sponsoring more teams than any other brand at the World Cup but Nike dominates when it comes to the boots the players will wearAdidas will celebrate 20 years as an official partner of Fifa on Thursday when the 2018 World Cup begins in Russia. The German outfitter has spent hundreds of millions of pounds — including between $96 million (£71.9m) and $176 million for this year’s tournament — for exclusive rights that include having its logo on match balls and referees’ uniforms.Spain, Argentina and the defending champions Germany are among the 12-team contingent that will wear the three stripes over the next month, the largest representation of any brand. But it is Adidas’s old foe Nike that could end up winning this year’s battle of the brands.Nike controls basketball and American football on its home soil and has chipped away at Adidas’s dominance in “soccer” for decades. Football has grown exponentially in the United States, and the Oregon-based group has adjusted its strategy to focus on a larger piece of the multibillion-pound global market.At recent World Cups, Adidas teams have dominated: in 2014 the company boasted both teams in the final when Germany beat Argentina, and over the past five tournaments three winners have lifted the trophy donning the Adidas logo.Adidas was founded almost 70 years ago by one of two brothers in the small German town of Herzogenaurach — the result of a bitter fallout that led the other brother to start the rival brand Puma. But Adidas’s success cannot be bought with history alone.Success from the World Cup comes at different times, according to Andreas Inderst, senior equity research analyst at Macquarie Group. Because Adidas is an official sponsor, its shirts are a main seller.“At the time of the World Cup it’s certainly the jersey business, because many supporters buy the jersey,” Inderst says. “If you go to Germany and watch, let’s say in Berlin with up to one million other people on giant screens, there will be lots of German national jerseys but also from the opponent. Of course you don’t go there with your football boots.”After the tournament ends and the new football season and school year start, Nike’s high volume of top athletes resonates with children and young adults looking to buy boots and other sport-inspired streetwear.Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar are the faces of Nike’s football brand but the company has also stockpiled some of the game’s up-and-coming stars, notably Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling. In fact, 132 of the 200 most expensive players at the World Cup, as ranked by CIES Football Observatory, will wear Nike boots. Adidas will have 59.The groundwork Nike has done over the past decade has been smart, yet simple. While Adidas has given hundreds of millions to Fifa, Nike has ploughed its massive resources into growing the marketability of its athletes, primarily via social media, according to Mark Thompson, managing director of the sponsorship management software SponServe.Nielsen Sports’ 2018 World Football Report estimates that Ronaldo amassed more than half a billion engagements across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram between January and May. That’s more than 350 million more than Lionel Messi, Adidas’s top online influencer, who does not have a Twitter account. In terms of followers, Ronaldo has more than Beyoncé and LeBron James combined.Declaring a winner of the World Cup is difficult, even more so before a ball has been kicked. What we do know, though, is that Nike is serious about football and is a major threat to Adidas’s market lead.“Picking a winner or loser is almost impossible,” Thompson said. “That will be down to how well each brand’s marketing teams have planned and can maximise the value of their activations around this incredible event.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ed017084d91b06d70f0be419eeb02690254845f/0_95_2277_1366/master/2277.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dcca344674af50ad401d49572ea3327","title":"guardiola klopp mourinho pochettino england world cup","story":"July 4 1990 was the first time football broke my heart. I was six years old and spent three magical and exciting weeks watching England progress through the World Cup in Italy enthralled by Gary Lineker’s goals, the dribbles of Chris Waddle and Peter Beardsley and the sheer raw genius of Gazza before West Germany killed the dream and the euphoria was replaced by sobbing. The whole nation mourned that day and some would say it was yet another “welcome to being an England fan” moment.As a nation we haven’t reached a World Cup semi-final since but when the tears had dried and I grew up I reflected on 1990 as a moment which restored pride and joy to English football after the stadium disasters at Heysel and Hillsborough and the negativity of a hooligan element which had dragged our reputation to an embarrassing low. Our record in the most recent tournaments has been poor and has led to a palpable lack of expectation regarding what we might achieve in Russia in the next few weeks.It has also seen a distinct change in attitude among the players in this England squad, who have travelled with less emotional baggage than any group in living memory. That has manifested itself in the way they are approaching the challenge and exhibiting a kind of openness to the media, and therefore the public, which is almost unheard of. I was surprised and encouraged when all 23 players turned up for a Super Bowl-style press day last week, showing a maturity and understanding of how important it is to reconnect.Maybe the FA was bearing in mind it was heading to the nation which gave us glasnost when it set up unprecedented access to its elite players, which resulted in lads like Raheem Sterling putting his sometimes difficult relationship with the media to one side and speaking openly about his optimism for the tournament and addressing issues he’s had with his public image. Instead of the fame and riches people got to see a nice kid who’s living his dream of playing for England and determined to do well for his country.The schism between players, fans and the media is one of the problems the modern game has created. It has made it easy for all sides to feel a lack of connection and empathy for each other, so when Danny Rose spoke so honestly about his depression I believe everyone sensed that the dynamic is changing in the England camp and trust is beginning to be re-established. It’s still early but these and other signs of improvement make me excited that this young squad can do well in Russia.Several of them, when asked whether reaching the quarter-finals would constitute success (the stock benchmark for England teams in previous years), replied that they were going to Russia to win and what would be the point if not. There was no overconfidence, bullishness or arrogance, just a subtle self-belief and determination that suggests this squad – unburdened by expectation – will play without the fear which has crippled Three Lions teams previously.And why not? The majority of the 23 are playing club football under the guidance of the world’s best, most successful and progressive coaches. Pep Guardiola, José Mourinho, Jürgen Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino have instilled in their teams the benefits of a fast transition game where the key to victory is moving the ball quickly and getting behind opponents to hurt them.Not only that, we have in Gareth Southgate a young coach who has worked at youth and under-21 level with the FA and is familiar with many of the senior players he has helped bring through in an England shirt. The Germany team who won the last tournament grew up together in similar circumstances alongside their coach and that proved to be a crucial factor. Neither should we overlook that with Guardiola’s two-year tenure at Manchester City we also have the advantage of the Pep factor in England’s favour.It was the Catalan coach who worked week in, week out with the Barcelona players who were such an integral part of the Spain team who conquered the world in South Africa in 2010, before he enjoyed a successful first season with Bayern Munich, who then provided a raft of talent to the Germany squad which triumphed four years ago.Sterling, John Stones, Kyle Walker and Fabian Delph have become better players under Guardiola’s coaching and it’s no coincidence that England have adopted the fluid style which is the staple at City. I’m not claiming that he is responsible for two World Cup-winning teams as we all recognise the multiple factors needed to achieve the greatest accolade in the game. However, it can’t do your chances any harm to have arguably the best coach in the world on the training field every day with some of England’s key players.It’s not just Guardiola. Klopp has turned Trent Alexander-Arnold from a reserve to a Champions League finalist and a deserved place in England’s squad. Similarly, look at the progress of Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford under Mourinho and the excellence of Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Eric Dier and Kieran Trippier with Pochettino.Some people were underwhelmed when Southgate was appointed but he has benefited from the expertise of club coaches in the Premier League and no one can doubt the players are with him. His straightforward approach and tactical application have seen England qualify efficiently and go into the finals with an optimism which has been absent or unjustified for some time.Starting on Monday against Tunisia, I’ll be watching and supporting an England team who I believe may surprise us and exceed the expectation of the nation with their performances and results. No one can guarantee that football won’t break your heart but maybe, just maybe, this summer won’t be as painful as years gone by."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26c2d8cacce7569494fd2ef59f30680f851675c1/0_47_2073_1244/master/2073.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ffb7fe2d06725562ba3cbd31af36b18","title":"russia saudi arabia world cup 2018 match report","story":"After all that negative talk in the lead-up, and the inescapable sense of unease that this opening match could turn a humiliating experience for the host nation, it was tempting to wonder what all the fuss was about after Russia got the World Cup finals up and running with an emphatic victory that was every bit as comfortable as the scoreline suggests.The lowest-ranked team in the tournament – Saudi Arabia will surely assume that title by the time these finals are over – registered their first win in eight matches to put a smile on the face of Vladimir Putin, the Russia president, and allay those fears that the tournament would be some sort of ordeal for Stanislav Cherchesov and his players.The fact that they were playing Saudi Arabia clearly helped. Juan Antonio Pizzi’s team looked hopelessly out of their depth at this level and it is genuinely hard to do justice to just how poorly they defended, leaving so much space for Russia, whose first tournament win since 2012 never looked in doubt from the moment that Yuri Gazinskiy opened the scoring after 12 minutes.Aleksandr Golovin created that goal, set up the third for Artem Dzyuba, who had only just come off the bench, and scored a sublime free-kick with the last kick of a game that could not end quickly enough for Saudi Arabia. The other standout performer for Russia was Denis Cheryshev, who scored twice, with the second a wonderful shot with the outside of his left boot that arced over the head of the Saudi Arabia goalkeeper and into the top corner.Saudi Arabia were a danger to themselves and it quickly became clear that the invitation was there for Russia to punish opponents who dominated possession at times but were wide open whenever they lost the ball. The counter-attack was on again and again for Russia, despite the fact that Saudi Arabia were operating with a five-man midfield, and it was no real surprise when the hosts doubled their lead two minutes before the interval.Saudi Arabia’s defending was awful, although there was still much to admire about the way Cheryshev scored after Roman Zobnin, teed up by Golovin, had sold the Villarreal winger a little short with a square pass. Cheryshev threatened to shoot first time but checked back inside, sitting two Saudi defenders, Osama Hawsawi and Mohammed al-Breik, on their backside in the process, before thumping a rising left-footed shot from about seven yards high inside the near post.Cheryshev had started on the bench but was introduced after only 24 minutes, when Alan Dzagoev pulled up abruptly with a hamstring injury during yet another Russian breakaway. Dzagoev was in agony and it is difficult to imagine the CSKA Moscow player, who is one of the few mandatory picks in this Russian side, featuring again in the group stage.Russia were already a goal in front by that point in the game and it was a sign of things to come in terms of how easily Saudi Arabia were exposed. Golovin, who started wide on the left but moved into a more advanced role behind Fedor Smolov following Dzagoev’s injury, delivered an inswinging cross from the left that Gazinskiy headed home at the far post after Taisir al-Jassim lost his footing at the crucial moment.With Russia coasting, the game started to drift early in the second half. Mohammad al-Sahlawi, who has not scored for his country in 12 months, could and possibly should have got a touch to Jassam’s inviting cross from the right but the ball flashed past his outstretched boot. Russia, however, were in total control and added a third when Dyzuba, totally unmarked, headed in Golovin’s cross. Cheryshev’s glorious strike from just inside the area made it 4-0 before Golovin completed the rout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0dc1f8752bc5173ec0c6e105f517c756585a58d/0_0_2275_1365/master/2275.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0915b13f1a0fd2593f1ef91ac267abbf","title":"russia world cup 2018 saudi arabia football fan colour moscow streets","story":"The World Cup has come to Russia and Muscovites embraced the riot of colour on the streetsRussia’s World Cup has finally begun, to the cheers and quiet relief of a nation curious to see what an estimated $14bn (£10.5bn) and years of planning have bought. It was carnival come to Moscow, led by the Latin Americans in a riot of colour remarkable for a city where the weather and demeanour tend toward grey.There were Colombians in floppy clown hats in the metro, Argentinians downing beers in the park at 11 in the morning, and face-painted Brazilians juggling footballs near Moscow State University to kill the hours. And there were thousands upon thousands of Peruvians.“We took all the planes. The whole country is here now,” said Roberto, 26, who flew via Paris, as he danced with hundreds of his countrymen in the street.For the hosts, Thursday brought a chance to size up a national team that’s been called one of the worst in the country’s history, and a national project that seemed always to loom far in the distant future until somehow, incredibly, it started.As Robbie Williams belted out Angels at Luzhniki stadium, Evgeniya Frolova, 23, bopped her head and waved a Russian flag over her head. She was standing in a fan zone in southern Moscow under the shadow of one of the city’s Seven Sisters skyscrapers.“It still feels like a dream,” she said with a sense of awe. “It barely feels like Moscow right now. There are so many people smiling, everyone is talking to one another.” So have the hosts pulled it off? “Look around you. There’s food, there’s beer. What else could people want?”It was a day made for odd encounters. On stage before the match, a Russian MC worked up the crowd: “Who’s from Australia? Put your hands up! What about Asian people? Asian people get your hands in the air!” A Cossack choir in wool papakhas sang to confused Mexicans and Iranians. At times, the entertainment in the fan zone felt ready-made for a Russian political rally in the regions, but with a crowd bussed in from South America.Andreas Calvo, 32, an IT expert from Buenos Aires, had already learned the words “dva Heinekens” or “two Heinekens” before Thursday’s opening match, and he put them to good use, making regular trips between a food cart and the bench where he and a few friends had parked themselves for most of the day. “The Russians? They’re a little …” and then made an exaggerated frown before bursting into laughter. “But we’re cheering them up!” “Write that we’re loving it,” he added. Even the Russian team came through, scoring two goals before half-time and three more in the second half, Putin barely able to conceal his joy from beside Mohammed bin Salman in the VIP box. “I’m starting to believe we can make it out of the group and that’s dangerous,” said Mikhail Komarov, 35. “It’s a good start. Today was good.” Thousands of fans came from Saudi Arabia to watch the game dubbed “El Gasico”, a showdown between energy exporters Russia and Saudi Arabia said to be the worst opening match of all time.Khalid, 50, of the Saudi city of Dammam, said he knew that he had to attend this World Cup when Saudi Arabia surprised everyone by qualifying last September. “It was history,” he said, flashing a toothy smile. The dentist grabbed his two sons, Ibrahim and Jawad, and flew via Istanbul for Saudi Arabia’s match against Russia. On Thursday he stood under a railway bridge near Luzhniki stadium, enveloped in the emerald-green flag of the Saudi kingdom, slinking his arm over the shoulder of an Argentina supporter he had just met, then trying to chat up some young women headed for the stadium. “I did not know what to think before coming here,” he said. “But I have been very surprised by this city. Very surprised. It looks good. Russian people stop us to take photos with us, they even invite us to lunch.”“It has been really a surprise,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27cc823fe6a13e3c35ccdd032aef64d5fdde4e4a/584_300_2205_1323/master/2205.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa0ebc0d90e4eb9c3902c5222b6ce702","title":"sporting lisbon meltdown portugal world cup","story":"The chaos at the Lisbon club, where staff have been attacked and whose president’s outbursts have sparked player unrest, has been an unwelcome distraction for Portugal“Spoiled kids, let’s resolve this then …” wrote the Sporting president, Bruno de Carvalho, on his personal Facebook account at the start of April. Two months on, after a period in which 19 players have been suspended and a group of hooded men forced their way into the club’s training ground armed with sticks after defeat in the final league match of the season, it’s fair to say things have not worked out quite the way the man some have labelled the “Donald Trump of football” would have planned.While Spain have problems of their own as the Iberian nations prepare to meet in their opening match at th e 2018 World Cup, the fallout from the Sporting soap opera has marred the buildup to the tournament for the reigning European champions. On Monday Gelson Martins, William Carvalho and Bruno Fernandes joined the goalkeeper Rui Patrício in cancelling their contracts, citing “valid motives” for their decision. The Netherlands international Bas Dost, who was one of the players injured in the training ground attack, has also indicated his desire to leave one of Portugal’s most famous clubs, even accusing the president of perpetrating of “psychological violence” towards him, with the law courts now set to rule on the case.“It’s a big mess,” admits Nuno Travassos of the Portuguese website maisfutebol.pt. “He was seen as the saviour and even now the club is split in two. There are still many people who support De Carvalho and want him to stay, even after all this controversy. He has always liked to speak about the team’s performances and uses social media a lot. That’s why some of the newspapers have made the comparison with Trump.”Surprisingly elected in March 2013, De Carvalho has proven to be a popular choice among supporters for his frequent attacks on the Portuguese football establishment, including accusing their Lisbon rivals Benfica of offering gifts to referees.He has even been known to sit on the bench during matches – “creating a presence” as he described it – and also regularly texted his players after matches to make plain his dissatisfaction with their performances. But despite the controversial appointment of Jorge Jesus as manager after he left Benfica, Sporting’s season unravelled after the 2-0 defeat to Atlético Madrid in the first leg of their Europa League tie that prompted De Carvalho’s Facebook post.Having previously promised to stay away from social media after one outburst in 2015, the president’s accusation that members of his team had committed “grotesque mistakes” understandably did not go down well. Nineteen players subsequently posted their own statement on Facebook noting their “displeasure with the public declarations of our president” – a move that prompted De Carvalho to threaten them with suspension.Perhaps unsurprisingly, the denouement of the season was a disaster as Sporting finished third in the table, failing to qualify for the Champions League, before the damaging defeat to the minnows Aves in the Portuguese Cup final, who have been a top-flight side for only three seasons. Having already complained about fans being allowed access to the private car park at the club’s training ground, the attack on Dost, Jesus and several other members of staff a few days before the final proved to be the final straw.“The environment became awful,” says Travassos. “The players said in their resignation letters that the president and the board are responsible for this situation because they contributed to this bad environment and didn’t assure the security conditions of the team. That’s why they say they have reason to leave.”Patrício, the 30-year-old goalkeeper who has won nearly 70 caps, was the first to tender his request to terminate his contract after a proposed €18m transfer to Wolves was vetoed by De Carvalho at the last minute, while the winger Martins and midfielders Carvalho and Fernandes have also been linked with moves to the Premier League in recent days. Whether they get their wish remains to be seen, with De Carvalho having since offered to resign if all the players who want to leave reverse their decision, although the Portugal coach, Fernando Santos, may fear the damage has already been done.“Some of them are experienced players but obviously it’s something that they would have wanted to avoid,” says Travassos. “Usually the only thing we talk about in press conferences is Ronaldo, Ronaldo, Ronaldo but this time, there is more about Sporting.”But with a squad that contains 13 of the 23 players who helped win the country’s first major silverware at Euro 2016, Portugal supporters have every reason to feel quietly confident of their chances. A comparison with the 1986 World Cup – when a talented squad went home bottom of their group after falling out with the Portuguese FA over bonuses – is tempting, especially given the presence of Morocco, to whom they lost 3-1 in their final match 32 years ago after defeating England, in their group. Yet with top-level players throughout the squad led by Cristiano Ronaldo in what is likely to be his last appearance at a World Cup, anyone who writes off Santos’s side does so at their peril.“I don’t think this has changed anything among the fans,” says Travassos. “It’s a bad situation of course but expectations are still the same. The players will be focused and if there is a problem, the coach has others to replace them. We don’t have the options of many countries but we have very good quality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5116af6585664a641f9c882b66d663925cd71edf/0_262_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19dcae5b0a23ce8fbfadac084669cde5","title":"world cup women broadcasting jacqui oatley bbc itv","story":"There will be more women than ever before broadcasting to British homes from RussiaIn 2007, when Jacqui Oatley became Match of the Day’s first female commentator, one tabloid newspaper greeted the news with the headline “From Motty to Totty”, which the paper’s own football writer called “an insult”. The fact that a journalist had got a new job, in a field she had worked in for years, was suddenly front-page news.However, 11 years on, when Oatley appears pitchside on Thursday for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, her presence won’t merely be unsurprising – it will barely be remarkable.Oatley is just one of many female presenters, pundits and commentators who will ensure that more female voices are heard in the UK from this World Cup than ever before. On the team with Oatley at ITV the reporter Seema Jaswal and the England striker-turned pundit Eniola Aluko.On the BBC, Gabby Logan – a longtime occasional presenter of Match of the Day – Gary Lineker, while former England and Arsenal defender Alex Scott is among the pundits and the experienced football reporter Vicki Sparks will become the first woman to commentate at the World Cup.Meanwhile, the former England striker Kelly Smith features again for Fox Sports as a “soccer analyst”, and the Argentinian journalist Viviana Vila will cover the competition for the Spanish-speaking US sports network Telemundo Deportes.Does any of this matter? Hugely, argues Anna Kessel, the co-founder of Women in Football, which recently persuaded Twitter to create an emoji for the #WomeninFootball hashtag to raise the visibility of women in the game. “It’s absolutely massive,” she says. “One of the biggest barriers to women in football is this archaic idea that women don’t understand the game, but viewers are going to see these incredible, talented women who are knowledgable and natural.“When boys and girls watch this World Cup and they see these amazing women on their screens, that totally changes their expectations of what women can and can’t do. Blimey, that’s huge.”Oatley agrees, although believes that a cultural shift has resulted in more women in football broadcasting roles, rather than the other way round. “Why would you not tap into that experience, expertise and insight that those women have, especially when you are thinking about the ersity of your audience,” she says. “They are not all white males sitting on sofas back home. Its a case of TV companies and radio reflecting that, it’s not rocket science.”Which is not to say everyone in the audience will be appreciative. Threats and abuse are depressingly common – police were forced to investigate threatening letters sent to Oatley. But the casual sexism she regularly receives is more often batted away with sanguine smarts.While covering Euro 2016, a Twitter user suggested she should be at home cooking the dinner, rather than presenting football. She responded: “Sorry – bit busy doing my dream job but I’ll make you a custard pie when I get home, pet.”This year she tweeted a pithy response to Ken Tomlinson, who had written to the Sheffield Star to complain about the number of women – “by at least, on some occasions, as many as six women reporters” – on the BBC show Final Score.Oatley responded: “Dear Ken, terribly sorry to ruin your afternoon but there will be 4 female reporters out of 20 on Final Score today (incl @suesmith8 with 93 England caps) but, thankfully for you, none in the studio. So enjoy Radio Sheffield. Love, Jacqui x PS most of your facts are incorrect.”But the environment for women and girls in football is improving all the time, says Final Score and Match of the Day regular Robyn Cowen. “Jacqui took a bullet for us,” she says. “I think the BBC learned from that, and they have been nothing but supportive to me – and hopefully the generation coming after me will have it even better.”Anyway, such critics are swimming against the tide, argues Oatley. “In another 10 years it will just be the norm, and we won’t be having this conversation,” she says. “You’ll have men working in the women’s game and women working in the men’s and that’s all it will be: just football.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b93e346299d3b9fd1b87ec4484efbf7686de9e4c/0_250_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2331d111fcf2152847a390ef5b07ec65","title":"russia saudi arabia world cup 2018 live","story":"World Cup Football Daily: Don’t forget that we’ll be recording at stumps every night there’s football during this tournament, which means it’s time for me to head off and chew the fat on today’s action, before previewing tomorrow’s.You’ll be able to download our musings in all the usual places and we look forward to your company.

A fairly dreary game was studded with some excellent goals and while a Russia team low on confidence can take great heart from this emphatic victory, it’s difficult to put into words just how dreadful Saudi Arabia were.Ponderous and sloppy on the ball, which they gave away at every available opportunity. Their defence is awful, they are completely toothless in attack and failed to muster a single shot on goal. Igor Akinfeev in the Rudssia goal can scarcely have have made any easier days in the office. Short of taking a few kick-outs, he had nothing to do. Uruguay are next up for Saudi Arabia next Wednesday in Rostov. Russia take on Egypt in St Petersburg on Tuesday. Elsewhere in Group A, Uruguay play Egypt in the Ekaterinburg Arena tomorrow. The hosts won their first match in eight in fine style, but weren’t up against much in Saudi Arabia.If I was compiling my player ratings, I’d be giving Denis Cheryshev a nine – despite coming on as a substitute after 20 minutes, he was my man of the match and his two goals were sublime. His first needed two excellent, deft touches to make room for a shot after taking out two defenders and he duly sent the ball screaming into the roof of the net.His second was a wonderful curling effort into top right-hand corner from the edge of the penalty area into the top left-hand corner. Other star men: Artem Dzyuba impressed after coming on, scoring with his first touch, Mario Fernandes was impressive at right-back and Aleksandr Golovin was irrepressible throughout, rounding off a fine performance with a wonderful free-kick. Get your player ratings done now, from 1 to 10. They’ll be automatically collated and once you’ve entered your ratings you’ll be able to see the average player ratings from all our readers. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It’s all over – Russia have thrashed a fairly abject Saudi Arabia side by five goals in the opening game of Russia 2018. In a match low on quality, most of the goals were a bit special. It’s a great start for the hosts, whose supporters were fearing the worst going into this game. Russia get three points on the board and lead group A.That is a fantastic goal from Aleksandr Golovin! The Russian midfielder scores with a sublime free-kick, curling the ball around the Saudi wall and wide of the post, only for it to curl back inside and beyond the reach of Al-Mayouf from about 25 yards. That is a wonderful strike! 90+2 min: Cheryshev scores his second ever international goal and they’ve both come in the same game. His first was sublime, showing great close control. His second was also a beauty, sending the ball high past Al-Mayouf with the outside of his left boot from the left side of the penalty area. A tip of the hat also to Artem Dzyuba, who teed him up. Denis Cheryshev scores the goal of the night, floating the ball into the top corner with an insoucient swish of his left boot from the edge of the Saudi penalty area. 90+1 min: We’re into three minutes of added time at the end of the opening game of World Cup 2018.88 min: Aleksandr Golovin gets the first yellow card of the game and it’s for a fairly innocuous foul on Al-Faraj. Two bookings amounts to a suspension in this tournament and disciplinary slates are wiped clean ahead of the quarter-finals. 86 min: Russia win a corner, which Salman Al-Faraj clears at the near post. 84 min: Saudi Arabia substitution: Muhammad Al-Sahlawi off, Muhammad Asiri on. “Hey Asiri, how do we get from 3-0 down against Russia with five minutes to go?” enquires Clive Tyldesley in the ITV commentary box. Zing!82 min: It would be fair to say this match is over as a contest, in so far as it was ever a contest to begin with. If this Russia team are as bad as many people say they are, then Saudi Arabia must be truly atrocious. They can’t keep the ball, are completely toothless up front and have been unable to lay a glove on a Russian central defence with a combined age of over 70.78 min: Saudi substitution from immediately after latest goal: Yahya Al-Shehri off, Hatan Bahbri on. 76 min: Russia win a free-kick wide on the right and Golvin curls the ball into the penalty area. The ball is headed wide by somebody who wasn’t Dzyuba - apologies, I didn’t see who as I had eyes only for him. 73 min: Having been on the field mere seconds, Dzyuba scores with a wonderful header that I’m fairly certain was his first touch of the ball. The ball was curled his way from the right flank by Zobnin and the big man made no mistake. From eight yards, he beat his Osama Hawsawi and placed an unstoppable header into the bottom right-hand corner. An excellent finish. Well colous me pink and call me Mystic Meg – Dzyuba scores with his first touch. A header. 70 min: Russia substitution: Artem Dzyuba on for Fyodor Smolov. The rangy 6ft 5in striker could make hay against this extremely dodgy and increasingly fatigued Saudi defence.68 min: Heart in mouth time for Saudi Arabia as Al-Mayouf spills what should have been a fairly straightforward save and the ball drops to the feet of Smolov. The Saudi goalkeeper bravely es to smother the ball before the Russian can flick it goalwards.66 min: Cheryshev heads into the arms of Al-Mayouf after being teed up by Golovin. 63 min: Saudi Arabaia send on their first subsitute. Every country has their “Messi” and Fahad Al-Mulwallad is Saudi Arabia’s. Indeed, he was a surprise omission from today’s starting line-up. A winger by trade, he replaces Abdullah Otayf and takes up a central position, with Mohammad Al-Salawi moving wide. 61 min: We pass the hour mark and Russia still enjoy a comfortable lead, their goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev yet to make any kind of save.58 min: Saudi Arabia wina free kick in a good position, wide on the right. Al-Jassim curls the ball across the penalty area, but Salman Al-Faraj’s header is half-hearted and doesn’t trouble Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev in the slightest.54 min: Saudi Arabia enjoy a spell of possession inside the Russian half, but are struggling to find any kind of killer boy. Eventually, the ball is whipped across the edge of the six-yard box from the right flank by Salem Al-Dawsari, but despite stretching every sinew, Taisar Al-Jassim is unable to poke it goalwards. 52 min: Golovin shoots over from about 20 yards after Saudi Arabia lose the ball yet again. They like to play possession football, but seem utterly incapable of doing so ... which is a bit of a problem for them.50 min: Saudi Arabia lose the ball high up the field again and Yuri Zhirkov plays a long pass in behind their centre-backs for Smolov to chase. He wins his team a corner. Zhirkov sends the ball into the mixer, where Osama Hawsawi clears with a meaty header.48 min: Golovin tries to curl a cross in behind for Smolov, but overhits his pass. The striker scampers towards the touchline but is muscled off the ball by Mohammad Al-Breik. 48 min: A slow start to this second half, with the ball rarely leaving the middle third. 46 min: Russia get the ball rolling for the second half, with no changes in personnel on either side. That Cheryshev goal: Some of the Saudi defending has been little short of atrocious and Mohammad Al-Breik and Omar Hawsawi were both culpable for the second Russian goal. As Cheryshev picked up the ball on the left side of the Saudi penalty area, both defenders lunged in, committing themselves completely and allowing the Russian substitute to make room for a shot and rifle the ball into the roof of the net. Alan Dzagoev update: This, from Julian Borrill: “He came on as a substitute in all three group games in the 2014 World Cup, but missed both the 2016 European Championship and 2017 Confederations Cup with injury.”The hosts go in for their half-time break with a two-goal lead and it’s little more than they deserve. Yuri Gazinsky headed them into the lead on 12 minutes, before Denis Cheryshev doubled their lead 31 minutes later. He had come off the bench previously to replace the luckless Alan Dzagoev, who was forced off with a hamstring injury. 45+2min: We’re into the second of two minutes of added time. 44 min: Denis Cheryshev has been very impressive since coming on and he scores a fine goal to make it 2-0 to Russia as we approach half-time. With Russia on the counter-attack and a three-on-two advantage, he picked the ball up on the inside left channel from Smolov. He cut inside and took a touch as two defenders ed in, selling themselves completely. With the goal at his mercy, Cheryshev proceeded to blast the ball into the roof of the net from about 12 yards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36b707ca31f5a827555a5ff8c7aa3009fabfec7d/0_273_4943_2965/master/4943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d52bbf3716c6c7d8570f872d79e17bb1","title":"world cup 2018 opening ceremony first game live","story":"Thousands of delirious Russians let Robbie Williams entertain them as the World Cup got off to a lavishly costumed startRead the full match report from opening game, as Russia beat Saudi Arabia 5-0Michael Hann on the opening ceremony:A Russian MP has encouraged Russians to have sex with visiting foreign football fans, a day after Russian authorities were embarrassed when one of his fellow parliamentarians warned against World Cup sexual liaisons.And with that, I’m going to leave you. Barry Glendenning is on hand to take you through the actual football. Enjoy!The national anthems are played, while giant circular flags of the two competing nations are held by dozens of people in Mork off Mork and Mindy tribute costumes.Peter Tatchell update: he has been released, and told to appear in court later this month.Now Gianni Infantino is speaking. We were denied Rock DJ, and we get this? Where’s the justice? Not that Rock DJ is good, you understand, but it is better.Vladimir Putin is giving a welcome speech, which suggests there’s probably enough time to make some tea andor weep silently about what football has done to itself before kick-off.Here’s Michael Hann’s musical review of the opening ceremony:It was, perhaps, inevitable that Robbie Williams would begin the 2018 World Cup opening ceremony by singing Let Me Entertain You, rather than Party Like a Russian, the 2016 single that reportedly caused a certain amount of disquiet in the titular nation. It was certainly a robust opening for British viewers, but one wondered if it had quite the impact for the rest of the world: Williams’ s stardom has been largely confined to Europe, and isn’t of the wattage it once was. Still, nothing hung around long enough to get dull – Let Me Entertain You faded into the soprano Aida Garifulina warbling on the back of a “firebird” for a few seconds before Williams returned for a snippet of Feel, befoe Garifulina joined him for, inevitably, Angels. “And through it all she offers me protection,” Williams sang, echoing the prayers of flair players towards referees.The whole thing – compact, based around partial songs rather than a dragged-out epic – felt based not on the self-conscious pomposity of Olympics opening ceremonies, but the tightly scheduled wham-bam of Super Bowl halftime shows. Albeit this was a Super Bowl halftime show done on a fraction of the budget. There were no bonkers mass dance displays, but there were women in some Fifa-approved bastardised national costumes. And a man in a wolf suit giving high fives to Ronaldo – the original one – and a child identified in Fifa’s official schedule only as “kid”. Presumably all those Fifa riches were heading straight for grassroots football projects even as Ronaldo and “kid” grinned awkwardly at each other.It was short, it was painless. And it was completely pointless.Here’s a list of nations who have sent leaders to join Vladimir Putin at the World Cup’s opening game. It is a short list, which probably illustrates the extent to which the tournament has become diplomatically toxic:The opening ceremony is closed. Over the next few minutes an emblem, giant flags and a “players’ carpet” will be placed on the pitch. Apparently 140 volunteers are involved in this effort.ITV have cruelly cut away from the opening ceremony, denying us the chance of watching Robbie Williams sing Rock DJ while the stage is dismantled behind him. This seems rude to me.Ronaldo passes the ball to the mascot, Zabivaka. This was “a symbolic first kick”. Blink and you missed it.And here’s Ronaldo, interacting with that kid again. The official match ball has just been brought onto the pitch, by the model Victoria Lopyreva. This very ball went into space earlier this year, spent some time on the International Space Station and got back on 3 June.The 32 pairs aren’t exactly dancers. Each has one flag-bearing, marching man, and a woman dressed in spectacular, lavish dresses in the colours of each nation’s flag. Top-notch costumery here.It segues into Angels. Aida Garifullina will join in with this, while 32 pairs of dancers, each representing one of the participating teams, take to the field. Meanwhile 211 kids of the “football for friendship” programme will wave flags in the stands, and spectators will “hold golden stars”.Only 1min 20sec has been allocated to this song, so enjoy it while it lasts.Robbie Williams is now playing Feel, “accompanied by dancers and performers with ‘bird-kites’”. According to Fifa in the next 90 seconds “performers play with the firebird’s feathers”.Now Alexander Boldachev, the harpist, is playing for us. “A firebird enters the pitch, spreads its wings and reveals Aida Garifullina on its back”. TV cameras missed the wing-spreading reveal, sadly.Interacting, incidentally, means holding hands. Ronaldo and Robbie don’t hold hands, but the kid has a go with both of them. Anyway, now Robbie Williams is singing Let Me Entertain You, “accompanied by dancers and freestylers”.There they are, interacting!Next up according to the official Fifa information sheet is “interaction between kid, Ronaldo and Robbie Williams”.The ceremony starts with a disappointingly pre-recorded video of the violinist Yuri Bashmet and the pianist Daniil Trifonov performing Tchaikovski on a floating platform on the Moscow river.The trophy is in the stadium! That’s the good news. The bad news is that it arrived in a needless bespoke Louis Vuitton case created for no obvious reason. Here are some details:A few minutes before Russia and Saudi Arabia kick-off the 2018 FIFA World Cup™ this Thursday at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium, FIFA Legend and 2010 FIFA World Cup™ winner Iker Casillas will bring on to the pitch the FIFA World CupTM Original Trophy in its newly designed travel case by Louis Vuitton. Casillas will be accompanied by Russian supermodel and philanthropist Natalia Vodianova.The case created for Russia is covered in beautiful, lightweight yet hardwearing, laser-engraved Monogram Titanium. The trunk’s eight corners are protected with Louis Vuitton’s celebrated natural cowhide leather, and the lock and six clasps are made in ruthenium, a strong dark-grey metal, which has the chemical symbol Ru and was named after this year’s FIFA World Cup™ host.The teams are in, and the players are warming up, with less than 15 minutes to go before the opening ceremony begins.My first impression of the Luzhniki Stadium dressing-rooms is that they are unremarkable in every respect except cleanliness. They are absolutely spotless: Yes, but why?Half an hour to go before the opening ceremony begins, which leaves just enough time for a quick World Cup opening-game quiz:Speaking of music, I am particularly looking forward to an extended spoons of victory solo at the opening ceremony. I will be beyond disappointed if they don’t make an appearance. They’re not the World Cup’s official instrument for nothing.Please, enough. Hippopotamuses cannot predict the results of football matches. Hell, people can’t reliably predict the results of football matches. Stop this nonsense now.Michael Hann will be writing a little later about the use of music in the opening ceremony, but in the meantime he’s been thinking about soundtracks to this and previous World Cups:Today’s World Cup opening ceremony is just the spearhead of a month in which the music business will expect to make serious money. Robbie Williams and his label, Universal, will be hoping for the massive increase in sales and streams that traditionally follow a globally televised appearance (as will classical stars Placido Domingo, Juan Diego Florez and Aida Garifullina) the official World Cup song – Live It Up by Nicky Jam featuring Will Smith – will doubtless get it little boost after getting a run-out at the ceremony. But away from the Luzhniki Stadium, the industry is gearing up for a month of money making.For starters, Live It Up isn’t the only “official anthem” of this World Cup. Tournament sponsor Coca-Cola has its own “official anthem” – Colors, by Jason Derulo and Maluma. Telemundo, which holds the Spanish-language broadcast rights to the tournament in the US, has released J Balvin and Michael Brun’s Positivo – an old song with repurposed lyrics – as its World Cup anthem. And there are three more songs that appear to have been given “official” status, too, originally with the intention of there being a Fifa-sanctioned album, though there’s been no sign of it yet. Still, that pales in comparison with the nine – nine! – songs that were granted official status one way or another for the 2014 World Cup.Then there are the scores of unofficial songs: from the dreadful Rasputin Rebooted by the Stars House Band, featuring Ricky Wilson of the Kaiser Chiefs, and sport’s buffoon-in-chief, Andrew Flintoff, to the rather better Chin Up, by hipsters du jour Rhythm Method, though don’t expect it to be echoing round the streets, sung lustily by post-pub gangs of drunk fans.Old music, too, gets a push. World Cup advertising campaigns get built around music – for people of a certain age, Massive Attack’s Angel isn’t so much an expression of dread, as the accompaniment to Adidas’s 1998 World Cup campaign – and the money that flows in from “syncs” to advertisements is a major revenue stream in this age of declining sales. This year, Beats by Dré has commissioned a four-minute mini-movie directed by Guy Ritchie called Made Defiant, telling the “origin stories” of World Cup stars – and soundtracked by hip-hop star Anderson.Paak. You can also expect to hear ACDC on Coca-Cola ads and Major Lazer on Pepsi ads. Even the streaming services aren’t letting up, with Deezer and Apple creating World Cup-themed playlists. And a nation awaits what lachrymose power ballads BBC and ITV have chosen for their montage sequences (Oasis, of course, claimed to have written Stop Crying Your Heart Out in expectation of it accompanying England’s exit from Euro 2002).But what British audiences hear will be just a fraction of the World Cup’s musical spread. The combination of Latin American music’s booming popularity around the world, and the fevered obsession with football in South America means that this could be a massive tournament for the South American music industry: it’s no coincidence that both Fifa’s and Coca-Cola’s songs feature Latin artists – Nicky Jam and Maluma. This could be the reggaeton World Cup.Martha Kelner is one of our representatives in Moscow today, where she has been meeting some Saudi Arabians.This is remarkable: Antoine Griezmann will reveal his future plans on national television this evening:Lee Dixon is asked about the political situationThey definitely need a good tournament.

He held a one-man protest just outside Red Square holding a placard saying “Putin fails to act against Chechnya torture of gay people”. He was approached by police, who escorted him to a nearby police car and said he was being taken to the nearest police station. Demonstrations without government permission are illegal in Moscow, though one-person demos are allowed. Here’s another prod towards my piece on the BBC’s World Cup trailer.

A group of Mexico fans have driven a school bus decorated with drawings from Mexican culture (Day of the Dead, a man making tacos, mariachi etc) all the way from Mexico to Russia, leaving Altamira on the Gulf of Mexico on 25 April. They’ve done it all wearing wrestling masks and sombreros too.“We’re leaving everything behind and spending our four-year savings so that our bus can take us to our destination. We’re not afraid of death, and we’re not afraid of adventure,” they say.Read the full story here.Four years ago, the Germany team resided in a purpose-built five-star hotel on a tiny, picturesque island off the Brazilian mainland, with the spectacular lush jungle and sea views inspiring them to the World Cup title. This time, the defending champions have replaced their tropical paradise with a red-brick hotel block in the village of Vatutinki, along a drab strip of motorway that leads out of Moscow, surrounded by dozens of huge tower blocks.But, as Reuters report, Toni Kroos doesn’t mind: “I think it’s OK. We can spend our time here with two, three activities that we can do. It is absolutely OK and the desire for vacation afterwards becomes even stronger,” he said er had no water in his room on the team’s arrival this week, said Kroos, adding that some things still needed to be ironed out. Assistant coach Thomas Schneider had no water in his room on the team’s arrival this week, said Kroos, adding that some things still needed to be ironed out. “It is normal when you arrive that everything is new.

In some countries, though, food is more expensive during the holy month – and in conflict-hit areas it can be scarce at the best of times. Islamic Relief has a special Ramadan distribution scheme that reaches hundreds of thousands of peopleFor Muslims around the world, Ramadan is an important month for fasting and prayer. But it is also a time for family and friends to break their fasts together and, of course, celebrate Eid al-Fitr.Islamic Relief has a special Ramadan distribution, and this year the NGO is distributing more than 200,000 food parcels to some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in 35 countries around the world. The food packs, which include staples such as rice, flour, maize and pasta, are tailored to local cuisine and typically contain enough food to last between two weeks and a month. Um Ahmed Abu Libdeh, from al-Bureij refugee camp in Gaza, is using food vouchers to shop in a supermarket for Ramadan. “We haven’t eaten eggs for 10 days so that’s the first thing I’m going to buy for my children,” she says before buying cheese, jam and eggs for suhoor, the meal consumed early in the morning before fasting, and rice and lentils for iftar, the evening meal.The family is struggling to get by. “My husband is suffering from cancer and he needs regular treatment and medication, but we don’t have any support,” says Um Ahmed. “My sons have graduated from university but because of the tough economic situation in Gaza, all of them are jobless.”  Fatoumata Traoré, 35, feeds spaghetti to her children after receiving a food parcel. Her husband, Madou Coulibaly, is 45 and works as a well-digger. The family lives in Sirakoro, 190km east of the capital, Bamako, with their eight children, aged between nine months and 18 years.Affording food for the family is a major challenge, says Fatoumata. “We get by on the small amount of money my husband earns as a well-digger and myself as a gardener during the rainy season. We live a hand-to-mouth existence, buying the food we need when we have the money. As a mother, I cannot eat knowing my children have not eaten. I don’t know what to do when they tell me: ‘Mum, we are hungry’. Sometimes when I don’t have anything for them, I try to take out a loan so that I can buy some food. Seeing your children starving can drive a mother crazy.“Ramadan is a particularly difficult time as the food is more expensive and my husband is not able to work as much as he normally does, because it is hard labour and he is fasting.” Rojiya Khatun, from Paroha muniipality in Rautahat, is among thousands of women whose families were badly affected by the floods in Nepal last year. The floods were the worst people in Rauhtahat have experienced for decades, rendering thousands of people homeless and in desperate need of food, water, decent sanitation and shelter. Food packs reached 13,000 people in the district, with priority afforded to those living in temporary shelters and unable to feed their families. Ihsan Ali, monitoring and accountability officer for Islamic Relief Pakistan, tells an elderly man in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa district of Khyber Agency about the food distribution process. About 7,000 food packs were distributed in the area, to which families are returning after years of conflict, despite a lack of clean drinking water, healthcare and schools. The packs were tailored to local eating habits, with double the usual amount of wheat to allow people to make chapattis, a staple food item. Gram flour was also included, to cook the pakoras that are popular during Ramadan.Food is delivered by boat to Beledweyne in Somalia, near the Ethiopian border, 200 miles north of Mogadishu. This was one of the worst affected areas in the recent floods in Somalia, which claimed many lives as well as forcing countless people from their homes. Fatima Haji Ali is a widow with three children and two grandchildren. “It was so shocking,” she recalls. “Our farm was totally washed away by the huge floods. As you can see, I am getting old and I can’t afford the day-to-day food for my children. This is the first time I’ve received any food since the floods started.”Um Bassam, 58, lives in Alzouf camp near the Turkish Syrian border in Idlib with her elderly, sick husband and three daughters. She arrived at the camp after fleeing her home four years ago when he village was destroyed. “Before we fled, we used to enjoy going shopping for food at Ramadan and could buy all the food we needed, as well as luxury sweets. Now we are dependent on aid. The food pack is important for us as it contains enough food to last for one month, including cereals, oil, sugar and butter and helps to strengthen our weak bones.”Um Bassan and her family are struggling with their life in exile. “Ramadan is hard for us because we are away from our home and we have lived through very shocking moments. We have started to adapt to this harsh reality as so many years have passed. We gather together with other displaced people and chat and break our fast together. This helps to lessen our pain and grief and helps us to overcome the difficulties in the camp. I pray that this war ends so I can return to Syria to see my family and relatives. I miss my sons so much and hope to see them very soon.”Muyyad Bitar is an aid worker for Islamic Relief, whose office lies in northern Syria. In 2012, he fled his home in the Syrian city of Duma, near Damascus, when armed militia forces were shelling the area. He escaped with his family, including his sick mother, along small country roads and through a tunnel, before managing to reach northern Syria. He is a key player in the Ramadan distributions. “It’s very hot here during Ramadan, but our faith and our values give us strength to serve those in need. We do our best to help alleviate the suffering of those who have been displaced. Ramadan is a special time for celebrating with family and relatives and it is particularly hard for those who are grieving for their loved ones. I am praying for this war to end and for peace to prevail so we can gather our family and loved ones around the Ramadan table again.” The ongoing conflict in Yemen has led to serious restrictions on the import of goods. Commodities are in short supply and food prices high. Teams have recently distributed food to almost 1,000 families affected by the recent military operations in Hodeidah. However, it is proving difficult to deliver food to the south-western city of Taiz, which is under siege. The food transporter had to make a long journey around the city in order to reach the areas populated with those most in need. Amat Asslam Faraj, second from left, is helping to organise food distributions from her office in Sana’a. “My colleagues here describe me as the ‘engine’ of the project. I cannot stop working, and I won’t, as long as I am helping those in need.”Her husband passed away a few years ago and now she is bringing up her two children alone. “That’s not the biggest issue,” she explains. “I’m taking responsibility for my wider family, including my parents and my sisters. But working hard, being the only breadwinner in the family is much easier than watching unemployed people searching the streets for food.“The conflict has destroyed our dreams, it has changed me, and all we wish for now, is finding a safe place with a piece of bread.” Mohammed Munsar, 38, from Amran, had polio as a child. He has seven children and is struggling to provide for them. “We have had to keep moving house as I can’t afford to pay the rent,” he says. “Things have got steadily worse as the conflict has progressed.”This year, the month of Ramadan is bittersweet. “It is a month of helping those who need assistance. We were fasting to feel the struggle of the poor, but now we are fasting because we are the poor, we are fasting because we cannot find anything to eat.”A father and child from Maguindanao, south Philippines, wait for their neighbours after receiving a box of Ramadan food aid and a sack of rice. The other boxes and sacks are owned by their neighbours who want to hitch a ride because they have no access to transport. About 15,000 people have received food packs in Maguindanao and Marawi City."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we go then.

I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions.From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted.At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself.

This was history in motion: Anwar Ibrahim, the man who had paid the high price of two jail terms for his attempts to bring reform in Malaysia – and who had coined the “reformasi” chant as the rallying cry for change – had just been released from prison that morning. A free man, he stood triumphant on stage as I watched from the sidelines.“We have entered a new era for Malaysia,” he shouted, to another euphoric roar from the crowd. Just four months earlier I had made the unorthodox jump from being the ’s culture reporter in London to being south-east Asia correspondent based in Bangkok. It is without a doubt the most brilliant posting this region is bursting at the seams with great, totally uncovered, stories and every day is surprising. But it is also, honestly, the hardest thing I’ve ever done. While I love it now, Bangkok is not an easy place to parachute into: a vast, neverending metropolis of contradictions, where street-food vendors sell noodle soup for 20 baht (50p) on the steps of glossy shopping malls where rich and fabulous “Hi-So” (high-society) Thais stock up on Prada handbags. As a woman I have found it particularly hard to adjust to, not because it feels dangerous – on the contrary, reporting in this region as a solitary female feels refreshingly safe, and I am never harassed – but because Bangkok is a city which wears the sex industry on its sleeve. Walk down ordinary streets here and the sexual objectification of women is impossible to avoid: girls sitting in droves outside massage parlours and “sexy bars”, simply on show for the male gaze. An alley by my apartment is lined with such places, and no matter how much they are dressed up with twee pink heart decorations, in the cold light of day I regularly see a dozen Thai women line up in front of a (usually white) male customer while he takes his pick. It’s not an entirely clear-cut issue. My brief investigations into the Thai sex industry have taught me how much empowerment and how much agency a lot of these women have, but it has nonetheless been hard to stomach this dark side of my newly adopted home.And then of course there’s the dreaded b-word, that you never really fully understand until you move to Asia: bureaucracy. In my first week here a microscopic tear in my passport left me trapped in Cambodia and it was only after a Kafkaesque mission to four different embassies, two immigration offices and a police station that was I able to leave. I also seem to have already been banned from Myanmar before even having had a chance to go there my endless journalist visa applications are falling into a foreign ministry abyss.But while adjusting from the culture beat to the political and social fluctuations of south-east Asia has been a steep learning curve, it has never once been tedious. One week I am up a ladder in a palm oil plantation in Malaysia, the next at a Buddhist dog funeral in Bangkok, or in Kuala Lumpur in the early hours watching the police seize 284 designer handbags and 72 bags of cash, jewellery and gold bars from the flat of the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak and his wife, Rosmah Mansor (it seems Imelda Marcos may have had nothing on Rosmah).But covering the events of the Malaysian election in May and being there on the night of Anwar’s release will always be a turning point for me in this job. I had hustled my way on stage and watched from the wings as Anwar addressed the crowds – his notorious charisma at full force and his supporters roaring with joyful optimism. Here, in the screwed-up world of 2018, was something I had thought was impossible: the triumph of hope and democracy over fear and small-mindedness.  The overarching narrative in the region is of a march away from democracy and towards oppressive, authoritarian, rule: Thailand, ruled by an unelected military junta Cambodia, where leader Hun Sen has dissolved all opposition parties and crushed the free press the Philippines, where Rodrigo Duterte is slowly dismantling the rule of law and authorising thousands of extrajudicial killings Myanmar, where the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya has happened under the watchful eye of the former Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. So the international ramifications of this election could be monumental. Sitting down with Anwar in his home a couple of days later, it was easy to see how he has been both the figurehead of hope in Malaysia for so long, and why two previous prime ministers were so keen to have him out of the way. He was surprisingly softly spoken, but prison had done little to rid him of his ambition, even at the age of 70.He recounted to me a conversation he had with Nelson Mandela after Anwar was released from prison for the first time in 2005. “I remember one of my first long conversations with Madiba and he said to me, ‘Anwar, people say we are mad and crazy’, and I said no, we are not mad, but crazy for sure,” said Anwar, laughing uproariously. My pre-election encounter with the new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, meanwhile, I remember less fondly. Nothing to do with him – refreshingly, he takes no prisoners in his answers and, at 92, would probably outpace me in a marathon. I had been given just two hours’ notice for the meetings, and was still nursing a slightly sore head from the night before, when I had had one too many glasses of white wine with Najib’s spin doctor (meeting with both sides is a key part of this job).Yet, the thing I have come to realise most of all, in the past five months on this beat, is that reporting on the goings-on of the art and music world is really not so different to reporting on the affairs of south-east Asian nations. Sure, the ecstasy present in that Malaysian field was driven more by politics than illegal substances. But if my experiences here to date have taught me anything, it’s that politics and the art world eventually boil down to the same things:  money, ego – and expensive handbags."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca454d42ef45a711e0dc3c1492bca8addf238c1/0_220_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53f117e6e9dc739adb20fa6c94c2dce3","title":"making an honest crust consumers routinely conned by food labels","story":"Manufacturers too often make false claims and use deceptive pictures on labels, and regulation should be toughened up, says EU consumer championFood manufacturers are deceiving the public by mislabelling their products as “artisanal” or homemade and implying they are full of healthy whole grains and fruit when they are not, according to a new report.Food labelling needs to be toughened up, says the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) which has published the report. While manufacturers have to put salt, sugar and fat levels on the back of the pack, there is nothing to stop them making false claims and using deceptive pictures on the front.Three areas are singled out in the report called Food Labels: Tricks of the Trade. The report pulls together data from consumer organisations in a number of European countries. While the UK did not submit examples, BEUC says its consumers suffer just as much as anywhere else from misleading labels. Ben Reynolds, deputy chief executive of the charity Sustain in the UK, agreed. “We know that consumers in this country are being conned by phony products, and as a nation getting nowhere near its five a day, exaggerated claims about fruit or veg content are deeply irresponsible,” he said. “Vague marketing terms like ‘artisanal’ and ‘farmhouse’ fool us into thinking we’re buying higher quality products and we’re routinely charged more for the privilege. “This report highlights the need to have a national debate about food labelling before we leave the EU. Brexit represents an opportunity for us to design and enforce our own regulations on food labelling, protect UK consumers and make it easier to make healthy choices.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bb7791018d78dd0ddfb15a71ba421da0fa6b678/0_80_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f32ea09b0c26fd2246f5066ea07d62d7","title":"how russia won the world cup","story":"Princes, prime ministers and presidents were sent to boost bids from competing nations – but Fifa was playing its own game.On 8 June 2010, three days before the kickoff of the World Cup in South Africa, envoys from Russia and England stood outside a meeting room in Johannesburg’s Sandton Convention Centre, nervously waiting to make their pitch to host the 2018 tournament.Their audience: elected representatives of the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football, or Concacaf. Fifa’s 208 member associations, each governing soccer in their countries, were split between six confederations. Concacaf, with 35 member associations under its umbrella, was one of them, and it, in turn, reported up to Fifa. Its territory stretched from Panama in the south to Canada in the north, and included the US, as well as all of the Caribbean and the sparsely populated South American countries Suriname and Guyana.With the possible exception of Mexico, the confederation’s members were not considered particularly formidable on the soccer pitch – but in the cutthroat field of international soccer politics, Concacaf was a powerhouse.That influence was largely due to Jack Warner, Concacaf’s Trinidadian president. Wiry, with glasses over a deeply lined face, he made a point of reminding people that he was a black man who had risen from abject poverty. He was also a born politician, able to whip all of his confederation’s member nations into a reliably unified voting bloc at Fifa’s annual congresses. That unrivaled discipline gave Concacaf an outsized influence compared with other, larger soccer confederations, which struggled with internal strife and factionalism, splitting their votes, sometimes several ways.It also made Warner, 67 years old at the time, one of the most powerful and feared men in soccer. His position was rarely, if ever, challenged. In exchange for the generous disbursement of money that spilled down through him from the highest reaches of the sport, he expected his member associations to vote exactly as he instructed.Born into grinding poverty in rural Trinidad, Warner had risen to become the third-ranking vice president of Fifa and the longest-serving member of its executive committee, or ExCo, the 24-man body tasked with making Fifa’s most important decisions – including determining where World Cups are held.Anyone bidding for the tournament knew that courting Warner was critical. The ExCo vote on where to host both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups was to be held in Zurich on 2 December 2010, and with just under six months to go, the Concacaf meeting in Johannesburg was viewed as a critical sales opportunity.England was preparing a bid, and was up against a number of competitors. Belgium and the Netherlands had teamed up to make up one rival bid Spain and Portugal another. A host of other countries were battling for the rights to the 2022 World Cup, among them the US, Australia and Qatar. But England’s most formidable adversary for 2018 was without a doubt Russia.Russia had been awarded the 2014 Winter Olympics just 18 months earlier, and had been riding nearly a decade of spectacular economic growth, thanks largely to record prices for oil and other natural resources.The country, and particularly its leader, Vladimir Putin, had been eager to take advantage of that boom to reassert its long-relinquished role as a world power. Winning the right to host the World Cup, watched by hundreds of millions around the world, would undoubtedly be an effective way to help plant that idea, projecting strength and stability. Most critically, it would boost Putin’s image among the Russian people. Losing the vote, for Putin, was unthinkable.Russia’s delegation, led by Alexey Sorokin, the Russian Football Union’s general secretary, presented first. It did not go well. For starters, Russia’s national soccer team had failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup thanks to a humiliating loss the previous November to lowly Slovenia, a country with a population only slightly larger than the Siberian city of Novosibirsk. Russia’s presentation, meanwhile, was embarrassingly marred by a glitchy PowerPoint display that failed three times as Sorokin spoke. By comparison, England’s bid team turned in a dazzling performance.The English press, in a fit of uncharacteristic optimism, hailed the presentation as a sign that England’s chances looked good, and that technical prowess, existing infrastructure and general competency – merit – would win the day. The Russians, however, were playing a different game.Two days after the Concacaf meeting in Johannesburg, Fifa held what it dubbed a “bidding expo”. A sort of commercial trade show for the World Cup itself, the event provided all nine countries competing for the right to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments the chance to meet delegates from around the world. In particular, it was an opportunity to mingle with nearly every executive committee member.Several hours earlier, the billionaire owner of Chelsea FC, Roman Abramovich, walked into Johannesburg’s Gallagher Convention Centre. He had arrived that day on his private jet, accompanied by Igor Shuvalov, Russia’s first deputy prime minister.A high-school dropout and former auto mechanic and commodities trader whose fortune was made thanks to his staunch support of Boris Yeltsin, Abramovich came to control Sibneft, one of Russia’s largest oil producers. Subsequently, he supported Putin as a candidate to succeed Yeltsin, and was richly rewarded for his loyalty. Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 and moved to London five years later, after selling off many of his Russian holdings. Unlike many oligarchs who left Russia, Abramovich maintained a close relationship with Putin.As a rule, billionaires hate to wait for anything. But once the bidding expo began, the normally shy and retiring Abramovich, wearing a tailored charcoal suit rather than his usual jeans, made an unusually enthusiastic show of good cheer.A smile plastered over his unshaven jaw, he joined a contingent of his countrymen, including the Arsenal star Andrey Arshavin, in the Russian booth, greeting soccer officials from around the world, and mugging for photographs with David Beckham.And finally, when the expo was drawing to a close, Abramovich walked out of the hall alongside Sepp Blatter, the Swiss president of Fifa. With so much attention cast in Beckham’s direction, scarcely anyone even noticed them quietly departing together.Earlier in the day, Blatter had bragged to Fifa’s entire membership about the organisation’s record profits in the four years leading up to 2010. He boasted of Fifa having $1bn in the bank, and grandly pledged to distribute $250,000 to each member association as a bonus, plus $2.5m to each confederation. It was the kind of naked patronage that had earned him the adoration of many of Fifa’s 208 members – a larger assembly than that of the United Nations.As he announced in a press conference after the congress concluded, Blatter was planning to run for a fourth consecutive term as Fifa president. “We shall work for the next generation,” he said, intentionally paraphrasing Winston Churchill.After a dozen years in office, and 17 years before that as general secretary, Blatter had grown acutely aware of the cost of maintaining power in an organisation as wealthy, erse and cutthroat as Fifa. More than anyone, he had mastered the darker arts of administering the world’s most popular sport, and had a hand in many of its most Machiavellian deals and accommodations over the years.Engrossed in hushed conversation, the unusually jocular Russian billionaire and the balding, diminutive Fifa president rode an escalator up to the convention centre’s second floor. They then slipped into a private meeting room and quietly closed the door.For those running England 2018, as the bid was officially called, it was evident that winning the right to host was going to depend on more than just the quality of each country’s stadiums, airports and football. In order to gather intelligence on the competing bids, the iniduals and companies supporting England’s bid had hired a former spy who had spent several years undercover in Moscow in the early 1990s, and then taken up a senior post on the Russia desk at MI6 headquarters in London. His name was Christopher Steele.His task, he said, was to help England 2018 “better understand what they were up against, and what they were up against was a completely alien way of doing business”. In the spring of 2010, not long after sources began saying that Putin had suddenly taken a strong personal interest in the bid, Steele began hearing a string of curious and troubling rumours.In April, Russia’s deputy prime minister, Igor Sechin, went to Qatar to discuss a massive natural gas extraction project. That same month, Russia’s World Cup bid team also travelled there. One of Steele’s best sources said the timing was no coincidence, and that on top of massive gas deals, the emissaries were colluding to swap World Cup votes. Russia, the theory went, would pledge its ExCo member’s vote for 2022 to Qatar, and Qatar would promise that, in exchange, its ExCo member would pick Russia for 2018.Other sources, meanwhile, began whispering that Russian bid officials had taken valuable paintings from the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg and offered them to ExCo members in exchange for votes.When Steele reported his findings, members of the bid team were predictably alarmed. England was doomed, Steele felt certain it was never going to beat a country like Russia, which was clearly prepared to do anything to avoid a humiliating defeat on the world stage. But the former spy then had a second thought. The information he had been developing on Russia and Fifa was highly specific, but also unique and potentially valuable – perhaps extremely so. It would be a shame to see it go to waste. And it just so happened that Steele could think of another potential client for that information: the FBI.A thin crust of icy snow coated the grounds of Fifa’s Zurich headquarters early on 2 December 2010, as members of the executive committee arrived to cast perhaps the most important votes in soccer history. Without stopping, they glided past security in black chauffeur-driven Mercedes S-Class sedans, then down a long ramp leading directly into the bowels of the building.There they alighted on the third subfloor without ever having to step outside or be observed by the crowds of journalists who had been gathering at the entrance since before dawn. The building, known in soccer circles as Fifa House, was an imposing symbol of what the once humble sports governing body had become.Designed by a noted Swiss architect and costing more than $200m, the building, opened in 2007, presented a cold, inscrutable facade of shiny glass covered by steel mesh, set so far back from perimeter fences and guard posts that it could not be seen from the street.Sometimes called an “underground skyscraper,” five of Fifa House’s eight floors were subterranean, and the building’s grand lobby, redolent in contrasting polished and rough-hewn stone, was quietly decorated with expensively discreet flowers. The aesthetic was rigorously Swiss, with almost no adornment anywhere, but it was clear that no expense had been spared.The beating heart of both building and institution was found on the third sublevel. There sat the executive boardroom, where Fifa’s ExCo made soccer’s most critical decisions. It was a room within a room – a dark, impenetrable war chamber ripped from some cold war political drama, with tall, curved walls sheathed in hammered aluminum and floors of polished lapis lazuli. Black-stained oak desks were arrayed in a large square beneath a massive crystal chandelier in the oval form of a stadium bowl.No sunlight was allowed to penetrate the enclosure, Blatter explained on occasion of the building’s opening, because “places where people make decisions should contain only indirect light”.At the turn of the 20th century, the soaring popularity of the relatively new sport of soccer led to demand for matches between clubs from different nations. But the way the sport was played varied enormously from place to place, and the need for a single organising body that could ensure fair matches between countries grew increasingly apparent.Britain’s four national soccer associations, which viewed themselves as the sport’s inventors and greatest practitioners, were uninterested in submitting to a higher authority. England’s Football Association, then already 40 years old, was particularly sceptical, writing dourly that it “cannot see the advantages of such a federation”, and refusing to have anything to do with it.Undaunted, seven continental groups – representing France, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland – met in the back room of a Parisian sports club on 21 May 1904, and decided to organise without the Brits.They called their nonprofit organisation the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, and by joining, the pioneering officials pledged to adhere exclusively to its statutes, giving it supreme authority over the sport. Everyone was to play the game by the same set of rules. Perhaps most importantly, Fifa would demand absolute allegiance from its members, and the complete exclusion of any soccer associations that did not prove to be faithful members of the club.Within a few months, Germany agreed to pay the annual membership fee of 50 French francs, and before long England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all joined, too. South Africa became the first non-European member, affiliating in 1909 Argentina and Chile joined in 1912 and the US entered the fold the following year.In 1928, under pressure from its members to create a tournament that would rival the popularity of soccer at the Olympics, while also admitting professional players – which the International Olympic Committee did not –Fifa announced plans for the first World Cup.Five countries submitted bids to host. But Uruguay’s soccer association, which had won gold medals in the 1924 and 1928 Olympics, offered to cover the travel costs of visiting teams, to build a huge new stadium at its own expense, and to share any profits with Fifa, while absorbing all the risk of a financial loss by itself.“These arguments,” Fifa later noted, “were decisive.” Unwilling or unable to make such financial commitments, the other countries dropped their bids, and 13 nations ultimately competed in the first World Cup, which was an instant hit. On 30 July 1930, nearly 70,000 fans filled Montevideo’s brand-new Estadio Centenario to watch Uruguay defeat Argentina 4–2 in the final.The event’s surging popularity did not, however, net substantial financial gains for many years. For its first several decades, Fifa persisted largely thanks to fees paid by its members, plus small commissions charged on ticket sales at international matches. It gave away, free of charge, the broadcast rights to its first televised World Cup, held in Switzerland in 1954, and even at the 1974 World Cup in West Germany, the majority of tournament revenue still came from ticket sales.That rapidly changed with the advent of modern communications and advertising, and soon television and sponsorship deals far outstripped gate income. Because such a large share of Fifa’s revenue began to derive from the World Cup, the nonprofit opted to measure its finances in four-year cycles concluding with the championship tournament.The cycle ending with the 1974 World Cup netted a tidy profit of just under $20m. For the 2007–2010 period culminating in South Africa, Fifa booked a record profit of $631m, and Fifa’s cash reserves reached nearly $1.3bn. The World Cup had become the largest and most lucrative sporting event in history.When in Zurich, FIFA ExCo members stayed at the Baur au Lac, a 165-year-old monument to the very Swiss aesthetic of expensive understatement. The hotel, on the banks of Lake Zurich, prides itself on absolute discretion, but does admit to having put up, among others, Haile Selassie, Empress Elisabeth of Austria and Kaiser Wilhelm II.During Fifa meetings, the men controlling world soccer could often be found sprawled on overstuffed couches in the Baur au Lac’s lounge, in suits, thawbs and robes, gossiping about the sport’s recondite politics over pricey cocktails and elaborate tea services on silver trays.Just weeks before the December 2010 World Cup vote, two ExCo members, Nigerian Amos Adamu and Tahitian Reynald Temarii, had been suspended by Fifa’s ethics committee following an undercover sting operation by the Sunday Times, which caught them on tape offering to sell their votes in exchange for six- and seven-figure bribes. Blatter called it “a sad day for football”.The committee’s remaining 22 constituents were a colorful if motley group that included a number of former professional soccer players, a medical doctor, a hardware store owner, executives of airlines and oil companies, a champion middle-distance runner, several professional politicians, a handful of lawyers and at least two billionaires.On the eve of the vote, the nine nations making World Cup bids had staked out the Baur au Lac to make one last lobbying push, bringing in as much firepower as they could muster to sway the ExCo members their way.Australia, vying for 2022, had dispatched supermodel Elle Macpherson to Zurich, along with the billionaire chairman of its soccer federation, shopping mall developer Frank Lowy. The US delegation included national team star Landon Donovan, actor Morgan Freeman, sitting attorney general Eric Holder and former president Bill Clinton.England, the odds-on favourite for 2018, had been humiliated several days earlier by the airing of a BBC documentary accusing three Fifa ExCo members of taking millions of dollars in bribes from the sports marketing firm International Sport and Leisure. The report also claimed that Jack Warner had attempted to scalp tickets worth more than $80,000 at the 2010 World Cup.Terrified of the thin-skinned Fifa officials’ wrath, England’s bid team had tried to get the BBC to delay broadcast of the report, which had been produced by investigative journalist Andrew Jennings. When that was unsuccessful, representatives of the English bid resorted to insults, calling the report “unpatriotic” and “an embarrassment”.Despite growing signs that the odds were stacked against it, England had rented two suites at the Baur au Lac and flown in its “Three Lions”– prime minister David Cameron, Prince William and David Beckham – to make a final appeal. Then, in a bit of encouraging news for the English delegation, word came that Vladimir Putin would not be coming to Zurich for the vote. The Russian leader noted he was staying away because, he told the press, ExCo members should “make their decision in peace and without any outside pressure”.For their part, members of England’s bid had lurked in the Baur au Lac until well after midnight, buying ExCo members glasses of aged single-malt whisky and desperately attempting to cut last-minute deals to push their effort across the victory line. Before turning in, Jack Warner had effusively embraced Prince William – a sure sign, it seemed, that he’d send his vote England’s way.Shortly before going to bed in his immaculate residence on a secluded street in an upmarket Zurich neighbourhood, Blatter received a phone call from Barack Obama.He had met the president in the Oval Office during a four-day visit to Washington DC the previous year, and couldn’t help but feel a surge of excitement when he heard his voice on the line. The call was short and formal, lasting only a few minutes.Blatter had publicly expressed support for the US bid on numerous occasions, pointing to the vast commercial opportunities that such an event would provide. Speaking in heavily accented but precise English, he reiterated that position on the phone, deliberately noting that he had only one vote and could not tell other ExCo members what to do.“How are our chances?” Obama asked.Blatter paused and softly sighed. “Mr President, it will be difficult.”“I am a happy president,” said Blatter, looking not particularly happy as he announced that Russia and Qatar had won, and would be hosting the World Cup tournaments in 2018 and 2022 respectively.He stood at the podium before a huge crowd and grimaced. The hundreds of journalists on hand to witness the result of that morning’s vote rushed to file accounts of the Russian delegation, including Roman Abramovich, high-fiving and whooping as Blatter handed deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov the World Cup trophy onstage. Minutes later, Qatar’s royal family followed suit, embracing one another, close to tears.Chuck Blazer, America’s highest-ranking soccer official, wearing a dark suit and one of his trademark colorful ties, was sitting in the auditorium’s front row, which had been reserved for the ExCo. Squeezed between Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar and Nicolás Leoz of Paraguay, he did not join in the cheering, and rose only to briefly embrace the suddenly exultant Qatari beside him, before slumping back into the chair.Directly behind him, Bill Clinton whispered with Sunil Gulati, president of the US Soccer Federation, then rose to shake hands with the politicians and royals in the room. Blazer remained motionless, staring stonily ahead. He had voted for Russia rather than England to host the 2018 World Cup, but later admitted he had been shocked when the US did not win the 2022 bid.Just a few hours later, Vladimir Putin touched down in Zurich, exultant. At a hastily assembled press conference, he thanked Blatter and insisted that Russia would be ready by 2018, and that he hoped Abramovich, who he said was “wallowing in money,” would chip in for some of the stadium construction.“Would it be fair to say,” one excited journalist fawned, “that you are the cleverest prime minister in the world by staying away and winning the contest from so many thousands of miles away?”“Thank you,” Putin said, replying in Russian and smiling. “I’m glad I insisted on giving you the floor. Thank you, it’s very nice to hear this.”Soccer fans in Australia, Korea, Japan, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Holland, all of whom had come up empty-handed, bemoaned the vote and questioned its fairness.Commentators in the press questioned how it could be possible that the two countries least suited to host the World Cup had won, pointing to the inhospitable climatic conditions of Qatar, where daytime temperatures in June and July, when the World Cup was always held, routinely surpassed 40C.But nowhere was it taken harder than in England, where the vote dominated headlines for weeks, and all conversation on the topic was reduced to agonised soul-searching, finger-pointing and anguished gnashing of teeth. Despite all its efforts, the country had humiliatingly garnered only two votes – from its own representative on the ExCo and from Cameroon’s Issa Hayatou – to host the 2018 tournament.British prime minister David Cameron, who had flown back to London on pressing business earlier that day, first heard the news from an advisor sharing the back seat of his bulletproof Jaguar on the way to Downing Street from Heathrow airport. The two men slumped in their seats.“We did our best,” Cameron finally said, before lapsing into stunned silence.One member of England’s bid team cornered Jack Warner and asked him why he had promised his vote and then voted otherwise. The Trinidadian hissed his reply: “Who is going to stop us?”Another member of that team, riding in a shuttle back to central Zurich from the auditorium where the results had been announced, noticed Fifa’s general secretary, the tall and handsome French lawyer Jérôme Valcke, burying his face in his hands, and muttering to himself.“This,” Valcke kept saying, “is the end of Fifa.”This is an edited extract from Red Card: FIFA and the Fall of the Most Powerful Men in Sports by Ken Bensinger, published by Profile.

Soubry said MPs would now consider backing Grieve’s previous amendment in full, which did not go to a vote on Monday night in the Commons after a compromise was struck with the prime minister. It has now been tabled in the Lords, where it will be debated on Monday.“We want parliament to have a vote, and a say, deal or no deal. I believed, as many of my colleagues did, that the prime minister had agreed to that so on Tuesday, we didn’t push it to a vote and we met the prime minister and agreed that Dominic Grieve would work with people from the government and come up with an amendment that delivered exactly that, so in the event of no deal, there would a debate and vote, a meaningful vote, in parliament. “That was what was agreed. Dominic, the solicitor general and others reached an agreement. It suddenly all changed. Which is the way of things sometimes. The appalling thing is that no one actually spoke to Dominic Grieve before they tabled that amendment at 5pm. I think that is unforgivable, you don’t behave like this, I’m very, very disappointed.”Soubry said a “perfectly sensible compromise” had been reached this afternoon but had then been abandoned unexpectedly. “Unfortunately it looks like the prime minister has sided with them as opposed those people who accept we are leaving and want to get the best deal for our constituents and our country,” she said.She said Conservative MPs who had trusted May’s promises in their private meeting on Tuesday night would be disappointed, and said they would have another chance if the Lords returned their amendment to the Commons next week. “We have tabled Dominic Grieve’s original amendment and which has been the subject of these discussions. We tabled it in the Lords in effect to take account of what we thought might happen but hoped wouldn’t happen, that the government would go back on an agreement that had been made,” she said. “Dominic’s amendment is there in the Lords along with this amendment which has not been agreed by Dominic and people like myself. And both will be debated in the House of Lords on Monday night and then come back to the Commons. And it will be crunch time in my opinion. And people will have to decide if they are going to put their country and their constituents first. Or whether they are going to put loyalty to the Conservative party first. As an MP I took an oath, that I would put my constituents and country first. “On Tuesday night, many people decided to back the prime minister, they took her at her word, they may well now feel very badly let down. They may choose not to blindly go along with this ridiculous amendment, but back the original amendment that Dominic tabled on Tuesday night. We are leaving the EU but we are not going to let these ideological hard Brexiters take us off a cliff, destroy our economy, destroy peace in Northern Ireland. We are going to do the right thing and put our country and our constituents first.”Read the report from Heather Stewart and Anne Perkins here:Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, has reacted to the government’s amendment on giving parliament a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal.It’s complicated stuff, but in short, it seems like the Dominic Grieve deal is off. The government’s amendment describes what must happen if the UK prime minister announces that no deal has been reached with the European Union on the withdrawal agreement or the future relationship. Under a no deal scenario, a government minister must make a statement to parliament within 14 days and give MPs the chance to vote. However, the vote would be on “a motion in neutral terms”, meaning that parliament has merely considered the statement. Tory remainer Anna Soubry has said the government wording may not meet the rebels’ demands, tweeting that the amendment had not been agreed by Dominic Grieve. The compromise over the “meaningful vote” amendment appear to have fallen apart, with Tory remainers reportedly rejecting the government position. That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.Here’s more on the “meaningful vote” negotiations taking place today between the government and the Tory rebels.From the BBC’s Laura KuenssbergFrom the Times’ Sam CoatesThe Labour party is opposed to keeping the UK in the single market but, as it set out in its amendment (voted down) to the EU withdrawal bill yesterday, it wants “full access to the internal market of the European Union, underpinned by shared institutions and regulations, with no new impediments to trade and common rights, standards and protections as a minimum”. Senior figures at the EU reportedly think this is Boris Johnson-style “cakeism”, a wholly unrealistic demand. But in a well-argued speech in London this morning Carwyn Jones, the Labour first minister of Wales, set out in some detail what this sort of Brexit might look like.I can’t find the full text online, but here is a summary with the main points.What I want to do today is to call on the UK government to use this last opportunity to come clean on Brexit, to erase the wobbly red lines and to get the country into a proper Brexit ready position ...It is to go back to the drawing board. Rub out the red lines, and argue for a dynamic and positive relationship with the single market.A solution where the UK makes a positive commitment to working with the EU27 to retain alignment with the single market as a regulatory space and a new, durable, customs union with the EU. In terms of the single market, we do not have to look far for a model. The solution may not be to join EFTA and through it retain membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) – though as a Welsh government we have never ruled that out as a potential part of the solution. But at least a similar arrangement, where we acknowledge that the EU retains its decision making autonomy and where the clear and stated assumption is that, except in exceptional circumstances, we will not just have regulatory alignment on day 1 after we leave, but day 1,001 or 10,001. As for a customs union, it’s true to say there is no existing model we can point to. But it is quite feasible to construct one. Where the EU no longer is responsible for negotiating on behalf of the UK, but where both the EU and the UK agree to the closest consultation about future trade policy to launch and conclude new free trade negotiations with trading partners in parallel and to co-ordinate closely on trade disputes and trade remedies. Jones said that, although the EU was opposed to cherry picking, it may be possible for the UK to remain fully aligned with single market rules for goods, including agriculture and fisheries, while being free to erge in some service sectors (and paying for market access accordingly). When I visited Norway eighteen months ago, it was striking that most businesses I spoke to were happy with the status quo. They felt they had the possibility to shape emerging regulations in the sectors they cared about by using their technical knowledge and expertise in working groups which they had access to by virtue of Norway’s EEA membership. And single market participation gave them huge economic benefits which could never be replicated outside. But they admitted that Norwegian politicians would have more influence if Norway had joined the EU.So we have to ask the question: if a price is to be paid for our decision to leave the EU – and there surely is – then is it best paid by a reduction in our political influence, or by the loss of investment, jobs, and livelihoods. As a politician, as a socialist, as someone who has seen the damage to generations of Welsh citizens of wholesale closure of industries, I know what my answer is.I have made this argument before, and it is one I even heard Brexiteers make during the referendum – if Norway can strike a deal like this, in the interests of its people, and not its politicians, then what is stopping us?Here is a court which has autonomy, is recognised and trusted within the EU legal order – including setting precedents where it deals with issues which have not come before the European court of justice. Surely, here is a model we should be discussing with the article 50 taskforce?I do not argue for the status quo. But we have to talk and think in terms which reflect the basic philosophy of the EU - that participation in the unique construction of the single market requires preference for EUEEA citizens. The suggestion in the press that the new home secretary does not understand this is deeply worrying. And we also should acknowledge – particularly in the wake of the Windrush scandal - that basic decency (not EU diktat) requires that once people have contributed through work to the well-being of the country they have chosen to live in, they should be entitled to the same rights (as well as responsibilities) of citizens of that country. Our policy paper, Fair Movement of People sets out a viable way forward on all this, based around two pillars: Linking the right for EU citizens who are not students or economically self-sufficient to move to this country more clearly to employment (and accepting that is also the case for UK citizens wanting to up sticks and live in Berlin or the Dordogne).Addressing the root causes of the disaffection and despair which causes deep suspicion of immigration, ironically mostly in areas where it is least prevalent. We need much more energetic enforcement and enabling of legislation which already exists to protect workers from exploitation further measures to promote fair work and an end to the misguided and disastrous policy of austerity.The first of these will need new thinking about our administrative processes: but I think we can all agree that the Windrush scandal proves that an overhaul is long overdue in this area. Where is the parliamentary majority against the sort of Brexit outcome I have described? For all his bluster, Jacob Rees-Mogg and his cohorts can only veto the negotiated withdrawal agreement if Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP vote with him. And is that really a credible scenario if the government commits to and delivers and outcome close to that set out in Wales’ own white paper? Because here’s the bigger point – I do not believe there is a parliamentary majority against the Brexit I advocate, but nor do I believe there is a public majority against it either.More on the “meaningful vote” amendment. This is from the Sun’s Steve Hawkes.Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, is the guest on Nick Robinson’s Political Thinking podcast this week. The BBC has sent out some extracts and one of the most interesting bits came when Watson talked about his recent decision to lose weight. (He has lost more than six stone over the last year.). Watson told Robinson that losing weight made him feel as if his IQ had improved. He said:I do feel like losing all this weight has actually been a transformational experience for me in a way that I didn’t know or anticipate nine months ago when I started trying to lose weight, and I do genuinely feel a lot calmer, a lot more in equilibrium, so I guess I am a bit more chilled out. This isn’t political, in fact there are the occasional days where I feel like maybe I’m too chilled out for the circumstances I find myself in. It adds to resilience and patience, and right now being deputy leader of the Labour Party those are two qualities I think are quite useful to me.The best bit about it for me is that it’s lifted a brain fog that I didn’t know was there. I feel like my mental acuity has improved, almost like my IQ has improved. I feel much sharper.Watson might need all that extra IQ power to fend off a challenge from Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary. The pair used to be friends but they fell out when Labour MPs tried to unseat Corbyn in the summer of 2016 (McCluskey backed Corbyn, but Watson didn’t) and they haven’t spoken since then. Asked if McCluskey and Unite were now coming after him, Watson replied:Yes, he is coming for me. They’re upping their delegates and all of that. What will be, will be. He’s powerful enough, if he wants to take me out as deputy leader, he probably could, but that’s up to him. I’m just going to get on and try and bring everyone back together and do what I can as best I can.John Bercow, the speaker, has just granted an emergency debate on the operation of the Sewel convention. He allowed it in response to an application from Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster. It will take place on Monday.This is from ITV’s political editor Robert Peston.It confirms that Gary Gibbon was reporting earlier. (See 12.34pm.)Mundell says he wanted to be able to bring forward the amendments to the EU withdrawal bill affecting devolution when the bill was in the Commons. But he wanted to bring forward “agreed amendments”. He could not do that because the SNP would not agree, he says.Mundell says the government will not have “bespoke arrangements for different parts of the United Kingdom” in its Brexit settlement.Mundell says he thinks the people of Scotland are “sick and tired of this constitutional wrangling”. They want the two governments to work properly together, he says.The SNP’s Chris Law says Murray Foote’s declaration that he is now in favour of independence (see 10.12am) means that the union is “well and truly stuffed”.Mundell says Foote is and will remain a good friend of his. He says people should be able to disagree about independence without ill feeling.

It could be weeks, or even months, until the sky clears enough for sunlight to reach the surface and recharge Opportunity’s batteries through its solar panels.For now, Mars’ oldest working rover is stuck in the middle of the raging storm, in round-the-clock darkness.“By no means are we out of the woods here,” said John Callas, the Opportunity project manager at Nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena, California. “This storm is threatening, and we don’t know how long it will last, and we don’t know what the environment will be like once it clears.”Flight controllers tried late on Tuesday night to contact Opportunity, but the rover did not respond. The storm has been growing since the end of May with unprecedented speed.Nasa launched the twin rovers Opportunity and Spirit in 2003 to study Martian rocks and soil. They landed in 2004. Spirit hasn’t worked for several years. Opportunity, however, has kept exploring well past its expected mission lifetime.Scientists are not concerned about the newer, nuclear-powered Curiosity rover, which is on the other side of Mars where skies are beginning to darken.Dust storms, which occur from time to time on Mars, send dust tens of kilometres into the atmosphere and turn day into night. Spacecraft orbiting Mars are too high to be affected.The Opportunity is unlikely to be buried or get a wheel stuck in dust. Even in the worst of storms, only a layer of fine dust is left behind. Managers said the main concern is that dust could temporarily cover its optical instruments.The rover’s batteries are likely so low that only a clock is still working, to wake the spacecraft for periodic power-level checks, according to officials. If the clock also goes offline, then the rover won’t know what time it is when it comes back on and could send back signals at any time.This isn’t Opportunity’s first major brush with dust.In 2007, a massive dust storm kept Opportunity silent for a few days. It jumped back into action after awakening from its deep self-protecting slumber.This time, the rover’s energy level is believed to be much lower. However, Martian summertime is approaching, which should keep temperatures up at night and prevent the batteries and other parts freezing. Besides electrical heaters, Opportunity is equipped with eight tiny plutonium-powered heaters.Scientists are eager to learn as much as they can about the dust storm to hone their weather forecasting skills. Astronauts living on Mars, for instance, would struggle if caught outside in a fierce dust storm, where winds can reach 113kph (70mph). Opportunity was in remarkably good health going into the storm, Callas said, with only an arthritic joint in its robotic arm. “Keep in mind, we’re talking about a rover that’s been working at Mars, hanging in there, for 15 years and designed just for 90 days,” said Jim Watzin, director of Nasa’s Mars exploration program. “It just doesn’t get any better than that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2329429f285258f947c1efcf703d082d62a4585/1481_886_4918_2951/master/4918.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3fa2bb6c8de396456753156fe0549be","title":"paws and play gene treatment helps rats with spinal cord injury regain their nerve","story":"Hopes for injured humans and larger animals as groundbreaking gene therapy helps mend damaged nerves on the spine of rodents by dissolving scar tissueRats with spinal cord injuries have regained the use of their paws after being given a groundbreaking gene therapy that helps to mend damaged nerves in the spine.The new therapy works by dissolving the dense scar tissue that forms a thick barrier between severed nerves when the spinal column is broken.Animals that were given the treatment produced an enzyme called chondroitinase which breaks down scar tissue and allows the broken nerves to reconnect with each other.Tests showed that when the therapy was given for two months, rats relearned the kinds of skilled movements they needed to grab little sugar balls from a platform.“The gene therapy has enabled us to treat large areas of the spinal cord with only one injection,” said Elizabeth Bradbury, who led the research at King’s College London. “This is important because the spinal cord is long and the pathology spreads down its whole length after injury.”While more animal studies are needed before the therapy can go into human trials, researchers hope that ultimately the treatment will help people with spinal injuries who have lost the ability to perform daily tasks, such as using a knife and fork, picking up a mug, and writing.“Recovering the use of the hands is the top priority for the majority of iniduals living with spinal cord injuries. It would enable them to do everyday tasks such as washing and dressing independently, picking up a coffee cup, and would be life changing,” she added.Writing in the journal, Brain, the scientists explain that the therapy could have a “significant impact” on people with tetraplegic paralysis, for whom regaining hand control could mean a major improvement in independence. Most human spine injuries, such as those inflicted by traffic accidents, damage the neck and so affect all four limbs. Before it can be considered for human trials, the researchers will need to show that it works safely in larger animals which have suffered accidental injuries. They must also find a way to completely shut down the gene therapy once the spine has healed. At the moment, the scar-busting enzyme is still produced at low levels when the therapy is switched off. “While we are hopeful, we know there is a long way to go to add further safety elements to the gene therapy before it can be used in humans,” said Bradbury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb70ec34b1657f19330ab5992c92cebeaf4f0a50/514_495_4448_2669/master/4448.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0466c8701e00c7dd7fc99e5f39ea7716","title":"us open 2018 first round live","story":"There are two clear clubhouse leaders but below them names are coming and going like trains at a station. Below you will see how things stand at the very top but many competitors are teeing off and joining the lead immediately with a birdie at the 1st, or 10th, depending on which direction they are teeing off. Whether they can run with that optimism is the real challenge. García has given himself an immediate chance of a birdie, landing his 2nd at the 1st within about 15 feet with a lovely plonk.Sergio’s on the 1st tee. Where’s Dr Golf when you need him? Ping! A leisurely wallop right into the middle of the fairway will do nicely. His US Open is under way. He’s joined by compatriots in Jon Rahm and Rafael Cabrera Bello. I doubt they’ll struggle for small talk, what with the crisis in the Spanish football team. Rahm and Cabrera Bello join him in the middle of the short stuff too.Ian Poulter glides a beautiful 2nd shot into the 18th to give himself an outside chance of a birdie and the outright lead. He sends his 20-footer uphill from left to right, but it curls wide of the cup. It’s an easy par though. He taps it home for a 69 and joins Scott Piercy as joint clubhouse leader on -1. What a brilliant round. Is this a comeback from Poulter? We’ll see over the next three days. There’s plenty of golf to go though. And tough golf at that. Justin Rose, who took a 71 today to go in at +1 – two shots off the lead as I type – is describing just how tough the course is. “Normally you walk off and you’re in the black and it’s not a great start. But that was a great start today. I played really well and hit 13 out of 14 fairways. I did enough good stuff to keep my momentum going. Green speeds were quicker than practice. I was surprised to see how much slope they put the pin on at 7 with the wind. You hit a lot of putts – and what you can’t see on TV – is the slopes. You hit a bad putt and you’re off the green.” Thanks Scott. I join you just in time to write Oh Rory! Having fought back with two birdies, on 5 and 6, McIlroy tickles a five-footer wide of the cup to drop a shot on 7. He seemed spooked by the wind. It’s blowing all right on Long Island. And he isn’t the only big name floundering out there. The defending champion Brooks Koepka signs for a 75. A disappointing back nine of 39, but he’s fresh back from a wrist injury, so he’ll not be overly upset with that. Meanwhile a fine up and down from sand to save par for Ian Poulter at 16. And he’s joined in the lead by England’s Ryan Evans, who had missed out on qualifying at Walton Heath but made it as an alternate.And with that, I’ll hand you over to Gregg Bakowski. See you again in a while. I wonder if anybody can make it to -2 again by the time I get back?Justin Rose signs for a one-over 71. He’ll be delighted with that. He’s been in good form lately, and that’s continued today. He’s two off the lead, now shared by Brian Gay, the 48-year-old journeyman from Texas having just raked in a 50-footer across 1. Some way to announce yourself at your first US Open for seven years.A bit of late-round salvation for Rory McIlroy. He follows up birdie at 5 with another at 6. He’s still +8, though the way things are going elsewhere, he won’t have given up quite yet. Jordan Spieth, who had also birdied 5, follows up with bogey to slip to +6. Phil Mickelson follows Spieth’s birdie-bogey model. He’s +6 too. This marquee group has been dreadful. But not as bad as the Tiger Woods, Rickie Fowler, Louis Oosthuizen one at Chambers Bay three years ago: they carded 80, 81 and 77. Fowler and Woods really dragged poor Louis down that day Oosthuizen finished the week 66-66-67, one shot behind Spieth. I wonder if any of McIlroy, Spieth or Mickelson have that in mind? I bet they do. Hang on in there, in other words, you never know how the rest of the tournament will pan out.You may remember Matt Parziale, the US Mid-Amateur champion, from the Masters in April. He shot 81 on the first day at Augusta ... but the firefighter from near Boston has improved on that today, and how. A stunning 74 in these circumstances. He’s not the only amateur going well today - Luis Gagne of Costa Rica is currently +1 through 11 - but he’s in the clubhouse, out of harm’s way. Incidentally Harry Ellis, of Southampton, England, who won last year’s Amateur Championship, signed for an 80 today.Matt Kuchar’s fall from grace continues apace. Another dropped shot, this time a bogey at 13, to follow his back-to-back double bogeys. That’s five shots gone in three holes, and the erstwhile leader is back in the pack at +3. A double for Beef at 13 he slips to +3 too. And a triple bogey for another one-time leader, Aaron Baddeley, at 6. He’s +3 too. The clubhouse is the safest place to be.Scott Gregory’s horrific round has come to a nightmare end. He finished bogey, double bogey, bogey, and ended up signing for a 22-over-par 92. That’s the highest round in a US Open at Shinnecock Hills, beating Billy Mayfair’s 2004 effort by three shots. If it makes Gregory feel any better, John Daly ran up 88 in the first round here in 1986, and five years later he was a major champion.Louis Oosthuizen has a habit of starting majors dreadfully before powering back later in the week. He stumbled out of the traps again today, with bogeys at 2, 3, 6 and 7. But he’s launched his comeback a little earlier: birdie at 9, bogey at 10, and now birdie at 16. He’s +3. He would have walked it at Chambers Bay in 2015, were it not for that dismal 77 on the opening day.Justin Rose passes up a good opportunity for birdie at 16. A ten-foot uphill putt pushed to the right. He stays at +1, nicely placed for another tilt at the title he won five years ago in style at Merion. Patrick Reed, chasing the grand slam - well, he is - spurns a similar opportunity on 5 he remains at +1 too. And another dropped shot for young Calum Hill, on his US Open debut, though he reaches the turn in 36 and will be happy enough with that.Matthieu Pavon, the 25-year-old from Toulouse, doesn’t have much of a major championship record to speak of yet. Just the one appearance, at last year’s Open, and he missed the cut. But he’s opened up with a very respectable one-over 71 today, and he’ll not be far off the top of the leader board come the day’s end. Beef continues to go well, incidentally: three pars since the turn, and he remains +1 after birdie at 1 and bogeys at 2 and 8. His easy-going temperament will hopefully stand him in good stead around a course as frustrating as this.Scott Piercy is back on the clubhouse with a smile on his face, his feet up, and a cigar on. He’s just signed for a one-under 69, and there’s a fair chance that’ll be enough for the lead at the end of the day. If he’s not in it, he won’t be far off it. He’s got a share of it now, anyway. Par meanwhile for his co-leader Ian Poulter, whose approach to 14 deserved better than the short missed birdie putt that followed it. And more news of Matt Kuchar, who has followed up his double at 11 by wanging one out of bounds at 12 for another double. He’s +2 ... and an illustration of how quickly things can change on a course like this.It’s back-to-back bogeys for Lefty. He drops one at 3 to slip to +6, alongside Spieth, four ahead of McIlroy. Other big names are in all sorts of bother. Charl Schwartzel has just run up a triple bogey on 3, his second of the day: it drops him to +9. Jason Day has bogeyed 11, 13 and now 14 to slip to +8. Bubba Watson has just doubled 14 he’s +7. To borrow a quote from Withnail, some of the world’s top major-winning talent reduced to the status of a bum. Naughty USGA! Sadistic USGA! Yet the thing is, this isn’t even the hardest this course has historically played. Right now, the first-round scoring average is 75.80 back in 1986 it was 77.88.And a dropped shot for Charley Hoffman at 2 means there are only two players under par now.Luke Donald hasn’t been a feature in the majors for some time now. Sad to see the former world number one struggle, but the sport’s loss is punditry’s gain ... he’s a fine co-commentator. He’s just taken his seat in the Sky box, and when asked if he’d rather be out there playing, declares himself “very comfortable” considering the scoring today. Some nice dry humour. Out on the course, both of the leaders drop shots. Poulter bogeys 13, the result of finding himself waist-deep in fescue after a wild tee shot Kuchar doubles 11, his tee shot having plugged the bunker and requiring two to come out.Ian Poulter continues to co-lead this tournament in its infancy ... but he’s the only non-US star under par right now. Plenty of European players just behind the leading quartet, though.Nope, McIlroy’s got to lob it. And he does very well to put the brakes on his ball, 25 feet past the hole. It’s about the best he could do. It’s still a bogey, though. He’s +10 through 11 and now needs a birdie somewhere coming home if he’s not to card an opening-round 80. Mickelson meanwhile pays for a poor chip: a bogey that follows that disappointing near miss for birdie. He’s +5. And it’s a three-putt bogey for Spieth, who drops to +6. The reigning Open champ walks off smiling, albeit in a style that utilises little lip. These three are dragging each other down.Scott Gregory continues to suffer. Since the turn, he’s made bogey at 10, 12 and 13, and ran up another triple at 14. He’s +18 through 15 and can only drop one more stroke if he’s to break 90. Ooyah, oof. Anyone who’s ever picked up a club will feel the poor young man’s pain. What doesn’t kill you, etc. Speaking of running up a cricket score, here’s Rory McIlroy: he’s at +9, now missing the green with a pushed tee shot at 2. Admittedly this par-three is playing at 252 yards, but that’s still not much of a shot: he’s got to get over sand, and he’s shortsided. There might be a route between the two bunkers to bump one up. Maybe.Some bustle at the top of the leader board. Ian Poulter drops one at 10, then picks it back up at 11 to rejoin Matt Kuchar in the lead. Meanwhile young Calum Hill follows up his eagle at 5 with a double bogey at 6. Welcome to US Open golf, sir. He drops back to level par, where he’s in good company alongside the likes of Justin Rose, Patrick reed, Matthew Fitzpatrick and Thorbjorn Olesen.From the thick rough, McIlroy can only chop his ball into the bunker at the front of the 1st. He faces a 45-yard bunker shot, needing to get up and down for bogey. He splashes to ten feet, misses the putt, and that’s his third double bogey of the round. He’s +9 and this is getting embarrassing for the 2011 champ. Spieth meanwhile dunks his approach into the bunker to the right of the green. He’s plugged, and does extremely well just to hold his ball on the putting surface. But that’s a 40-footer left for his par. He can’t make it, and he hands back the shot he picked up on the previous hole. He’s +5 again. Finally Mickelson, who clipped a lovely second to six feet. The birdie putt’s got a little right-to-left curl ... and he hits it too hard, putting through the break. He stays at +4 and looks genuinely distraught at passing up the opportunity.McIlroy takes an iron off the 1st tee for safety, and misses a 60-yard fairway on the right. This is becoming hard to watch. He’s only hit three of seven fairways, and missed seven of nine greens in regulation. Now he’s knee-deep in the thick stuff again. He punches out ... and into only slightly shorter fescue on the other side of the hole. Up on the green, Patrick Reed tidies up for par, his fifth in a row: he’s level and looking steady after a rollercoaster start of two birdies and two bogeys in the first five holes.Rory McIlroy reaches the turn in 42, after sending his second into thick nonsense by the side of the green at 18. Having failed to get up and down, he’s +7. But his playing partner Jordan Spieth is going the right way at last, curling in a big right-to-left breaker for his first birdie of the day. He turns in 39, +4. Like Mickelson, who pars, he’s only six off the lead, despite it all.Scottish golf could do with a new superstar: it’s been a long time since Sandy Lyle was in his major-winning pomp. How about Calum Hill, then? The 23-year-old from Kinross is playing in his first major, and he hasn’t taken long to make his mark. After bogey at 3, he’s birdied 4 and eagled 5, and that’s earned him a share of the lead! He leapfrogs his compatriot Russell Knox, and is one of four Brits in the top seven! Early days and all, but we might as well enjoy it while we can.Mickelson comes within the width of a dimple of birdie at 17. A lovely rake across the green, so unlucky. He stays at +4. Spieth doesn’t really hit his effort from similar range, and leaves himself a missable six-footer. But in it goes: he’s +5 still. And finally Rory, who flops a Mickelsonesque wedge over the bunker to eight feet, and knocks in a brilliant par saver. That’s only his second par of the round so far. He’s +6. Three pars there, all made in very different style.“Aw Rory! Jesus!” McIlroy’s mechanism has gone. At the par-three 17th, he sends his tee shot so far right it misses the big bunker guarding that side of the green. Spieth and Mickelson’s efforts aren’t all that either, but both just about manage to hold the very left edge of the putting surface. Meanwhile another of the pre-tournament favourites, the in-form Jason Day, continues to stutter. After bogeys at 2, 3 and 4, he looked to have steadied the ship with a run of three pars, but more dropped shots at 8 and 9 mean he’s reached the turn in 40. He’s +5. In normal circumstances, you’d say a lot of these guys were playing their way out of this tournament already. But the lead’s only -2, and there are only seven players under par right now.McIlroy hasn’t taken long to shed the momentum of that birdie at 15. He smacks his third on 16 into the face of the bunker he’s trying to escape, the ball squirting apologetically onto the fairway, a few yards ahead. He possibly got a bit too greedy there, he was up close to that lip. He caresses his fourth to 15 feet but can’t save his par. He’s +6 again. Spieth meanwhile sends his third to 20 feet, and is inches away from curling in a birdie putt. He squats on his haunches in disbelief: how did that not drop? But then again, birdie would have been outrageous after that miserable hooked drive, and the huge break he got with his free drop. Par will suffice. He’s +5. And there’s misery for Mickelson, who sends a strange wedge clean through the green, and can’t get up and down to save his par. He’s +4. It’s quite a struggle for this group.Matthew Fitzpatrick will be a major champion one day, I’ll be bound. The 23-year-old from Sheffield already has a top-ten finish at the Masters on his CV, plus a low-amateur finish at the US Open. He’s going well today, wiping off a bogey at 3 with eagle at 5. He’s -1. Meanwhile some even better news for fans of British golf: birdie for Ian Poulter at 7, to add to the one he made at 3, and a third birdie in the first five holes for Russell Knox, at 14, to offset bogey at 11. They both have a share of the early lead!Spieth has just flayed a drive so far left down 16 that he’s flown the deepest rough and nestled up against a fence. He’ll get a drop near a trodden-down path, so that qualifies as a huge break for the 2015 champ. McIlroy nearly sends his into the long stuff, too, but his ball stops just short, in some semi-rough. Neither makes a particularly good fist of their second, laying up on this long par five, but finding rough and sand respectively. They can’t keep carrying on like this. “Isn’t it great to see rough being proper rough?” asks Adam Hirst. “That unforgiving long grass really sorts the wheat from the chaff, and keeps the long drivers honest.” Yes, I’m very much looking forward to seeing Dustin and Tiger around here later today. It could go either way, couldn’t it.A birdie in this morning’s marquee group! Rory McIlroy is the first to put a red number on his card, knocking his second at 15 to 15 feet, then rolling in one of the straighter putts he’ll have today. He moves back to +5. Spieth and Mickelson par, making that this group’s first bogey-free hole of the day. Onwards and upwards! And at the top of the leader board, joining Charley Hoffman at -2, is Matt Kuchar, who follows his opening hole birdie with a second at 5. Three top ten finishes in the majors last year for the popular Floridian, including that runner-up slot at Birkdale. Could this be the time, and the set-up, for the steady, dependable, level-headed Kuch?It’s not as though Gregory is alone in his pain. The USGA wanted tough, after the low scoring at Erin Hills last year ... and they’ve got it! We already know about the travails of Phil, Jordan and Rory, so here are some other big names out there struggling: Rickie Fowler (+2 after 5*), Bubba Watson (+3, 6), Jason Day (+3, 6), Danny Willett (+3, 6), Charl Schwartzel (+3, 6*), Marc Leishman (+3, 5*), Louis Oosthuizen (+4, 7). It’s not quite carnage yet, but it’s in danger of getting very messy.Poor old Scott Gregory. People from Portsmouth are usually no fans of Southampton, and that’s certainly going to be the case for the 23-year-old qualifier, playing in his first major as a pro. He’s reached the turn in 47 strokes, having carded just one par, and that on the opening hole. He’s +12, after five bogeys, two double bogeys and a triple bogey. But whatever happens on the back nine, he can rest assured that he won’t have as bad a day as JD Tucker did in 1898 at Myopia Hunt Club. Tucker shot 157 in the opening round that year, a US Open record which is sure to stand awhile yet.Charley Hoffman would be a popular champion. The 41-year-old from San Diego has flowered late in his career: he’s hovered around the leader boards in the majors for a few years now, with high placings at the Masters and the US Open. And he’s currently leading this tournament in its infant stages, having birdied 10 and 13. He’s the only player at -2, ahead of a group that has welcomed Scott Piercy and Matthieu Pavon, but said goodbye to Justin Rose, Brendan Steele, Patrick Reed, Thorbjorn Olesen and Beef.McIlroy looks dazed and confused. His long bogey putt doesn’t go anywhere near the hole. He’s got the thousand-yard stare on. Back-to-back double bogeys for the 2011 champion. He’s +6 through five holes. That birdie opportunity on 10 seems a world away now. Spieth meanwhile could only smash his second from the long stuff halfway up the hole. His chip in stops a good 40 feet short. His attempt to save par flies ten feet past, though he knocks in the return to limit the damage to bogey. He’s +5. Mickelson meanwhile makes a no-fuss par: the advantages of staying in the fairway here, right there.An illustration of how deep the rough is at Shinnecock Hills ... for a second there, it looked as though McIlroy had lost his ball, a mere ten yards into it. Stewards eventually find it, but it takes McIlroy two lashes to get it back out, the long grass throttling the shaft of his club and turning it over. He finds the middle of the green with his fourth. This is a disastrous start for the 2011 champ. Some place, though, this. The only lost ball in Jack Nicklaus’s entire career came at Shinnecock, in 1986. He’d just won the Masters, his 18th major. McIlroy might cut a highly frustrated figure, but he’s in good company.McIlroy ran up a double bogey there, after hitting a sand wedge into the green. His putting - this isn’t breaking news - is a shambles. Spieth’s is uncharacteristically shaky, too. Phil is Phil. But these three need something to happen. Mickelson crashes his drive at 14 down the middle, but Spieth and McIlroy send theirs whistling into the extremely punitive rough down the right. That’s not going to be good. Better news for the 2013 champion Justin Rose, who is in good nick coming into this week. He’s birdied 5 to move to -1, and now has a share of the lead, because Aaron Baddeley has bogeyed 15 to drop back into the pack.The wind is really picking up. The tall fescue whips up and down violently. These are testing conditions all right. Mickelson comes up short at 13, then leaves his chip 12 feet short. Bogey. McIlroy dumps his second, a sand wedge, in the bunker to the right and shortsides himself. His ball’s plugged, too, and he can only blast his ball 50 feet past the hole. He runs his long par saver seven feet past, then misses the one coming back. Double bogey. Spieth however lands his second pin high to eight feet, a glorious approach. Or was it slightly pushed, a stroke of luck? You’ve got to take it when it comes. But his birdie putt stays out on the high side. Par. Nobody’s happy here. All three storm off in hot funks. Mickelson is +3, while McIlroy and Spieth are both +4.A fair bit of movement at the top, as a few players register early birdies ... while Patrick Reed drops one at 12, leaving Aaron Baddeley alone at the top. There are only ten players under par right now, but some big names amongst them, now including Ian Poulter, the in-form Thorbjorn Olesen, and serial nearly-man Matt Kuchar.At 12, Mickelson hoicks his second into the thick fescue to the right of the green. He can’t see his ball as he swings at it, and despite thrashing a lob to 12 feet, isn’t able to save his par. He’s +2. A two-putt par for Spieth steadies that ship a little: he stays at +4. And finally McIlroy misses another short putt, failing to commit to a downhill tiddler. That’s dismal, when it looked as though he was going to scramble par, having lashed an iron from the tee into the thick rough, only to escape well. He’s +2, and this marquee group is struggling.And the weather isn’t going to help much. We’ve already seen perhaps the most mentally tough competitor in the golfing world, Jordan Spieth, come a cropper on these hard, fast, difficult-to-hold greens. Thing is, the course is probably going to be at its most receptive today, after some showers yesterday. Winds today will dry it out, and then it’s mainly sunny for the rest of the week. On Sky’s coverage last night, Butch Harmon aired concerns that, come Sunday, the farcical scenes on the 7th green in 2004 might play out again, despite the USGA insisting the course is playing softer. Let’s see how this pans out, then.It’s probably fair to say that nobody is going to be winning at -16 this year. Pars, never mind low scores, will come at a premium this week. You can’t take liberties around these greens, as Scott Stallings has just discovered: having failed to extricate himself from a swale at 14, he’s run up a quintuple-bogey 9. Meanwhile spare a thought for poor Scott Gregory having come through qualifying at Walton Heath to reach his first major championship as a pro, the 2016 Amateur Championship winner has just played his last five holes thus: bogey-triple-double-double-bogey. The man from Portsmouth, Hampshire undone in Southampton, NY. Both of the Scotts prop up the leader board at +8.“Are you kidding me, dude?” Disaster for Jordan Spieth at 11. His bunker shot is way too aggressive: he cries in anguish as it flies past the pin, tucked near the back, and topples down the bank. Then his chip up comes back to his feet. His second attempt, a lob this time, very nearly topples back too - Spieth waits for it to come to him - but it somehow stops. Spieth runs up, quickly grabs his putter, and runs his double-bogey putt six feet past. He does very well to knock that one in for a triple-bogey six. Meanwhile Mickelson gets up and down to save his par, but McIlroy’s putt from eight feet lips out. Not sure how that didn’t drop, but that’s a bogey. So, then, this morning’s marquee group after two holes: Mickelson +1, McIlroy +1, Spieth +4.And now all three find sand with their tee shots at the par-three 11th. It’s not the worst miss - that would be going over the back - but they’re faced with testing up and downs nonetheless. In the group ahead, Patrick Reed’s hot major-championship form continues apace, the Masters champion having knocked his tee shot at 11 to 20 feet and rolled in the birdie putt. He’s now got a share of the early lead with Aaron Baddeley at -2. And joining the group at -1: Beef! Andrew Johnson creams his second at 1 from 140 yards to 12 feet, and tidies up for birdie.Mickelson can only bump his chip up onto the fringe. He fails to make the 15-footer he leaves himself, and that’s a far from ideal start in the quest for that elusive major. Also carding an opening-hole bogey: Spieth, who knocks his long birdie putt to six feet, then pushes his short par effort right. His putter has been cold for a while, so that doesn’t bode well either. McIlroy fails to take advantage of his birdie chance, so that’s a far from stellar start by this marquee group.Mickelson’s approach lands near the flag, but rolls with purpose off the back of the green and down a swale. He’s a long way down, and there’s not much green to work with once he’s back up on top the pin’s towards the rear of the green. Spieth, perhaps a little spooked, leaves his second well short of the flag, the ball only just staying on the green. A long putt awaits. Finally McIlroy proves it’s not impossible to hold these greens, landing his ball softly 12 feet from the flag to set up a birdie chance. Elsewhere, Aaron Baddeley’s quick start continues with birdie at 12 he’s the very early sole leader at -2. And the Masters champion Patrick Reed, ahead of the McIlroy-Spieth-Mickelson group, birdied 10 to join Grace and Koepka at -1. This’d be a fine leader board on Sunday afternoon, never mind Tuesday morning!So we’ll be concentrating this morning - no apologies - on a stellar group. It stars the 2011 champion Rory McIlroy, the 2015 winner Jordan Spieth, and the six-time runner-up Phil Mickelson. One of Lefty’s many near misses came here in 2004, when Retief Goosen kept rolling them in on treacherous greens, and Mickelson three putted from close range on 17. Could this be a fairytale end to his long quest for the career slam? He was chomping at the bit, waiting for Spieth to get on with his opening tee shot at 10, springing forward the nanosecond the Open champion’s iron met with the ball. He wants this all right. Anyway, all three of them have cracked irons down the hill and have found the fairway. All good so far.Here we go, then, folks ... it’s the biggest event in world sport that’s kicking off today! That’s right, isn’t it? So let’s start, appropriately, with the reigning champion Brooks Koepka, who has drained a 40-footer on the 1st to start the defence of his title in perfect fashion! He’s one of three men under par in these extremely early stages, the others being Aaron Baddeley and Branden ‘62’ Grace, who both picked up a shot at 10. It’s on!We’re due a good US Open. Brooks Koepka was a worthy champion last year at Erin Hills – he tied the championship scoring record, for goodness sake - but there wasn’t much in the way of drama as he turned the back nine on Sunday into a procession. Dustin Johnson’s victory at Oakmont in 2016 was another stroll, one mainly remembered these days for rulebook farce. Jordan Spieth’s win the year before was super exciting over the closing stretch, as he seized the day while Johnson and Branden Grace stumbled, but the quirky set-up of Chambers Bay means that tournament won’t be recalled fondly by the purists. And at Pinehurst in 2014, Martin Kaymer wasted the field pretty much from the get-go. You have to go back to Merion in 2013, when Justin Rose eased his way past Phil Mickelson and made his way down 18 like Ben Hogan, for a no-quibble classic.(Actually, on reflection, it’s daft to write off 2015 just because the course was a bit psychedelic. Spieth’s birdie on 18 was astonishing in the circumstances, bouncing back from a double on 17, while Johnson and Grace capitulated in extremely memorable fashion. Also, Louis Oosthuizen came back in 29! But I’ve written the opening paragraph of this preamble now, and there’s no going back. You get the general point.)Will the links of Shinnecock Hills deliver? Retief Goosen won his second US Open the last time the tournament was played here, with a hot putter in 2004, though that’s not one for the memory banks either. A dry course was playing ludicrously hard, the par-three 7th particularly troublesome, with players unable to keep their tee shots on the parched Redan green (one which slopes down from front to back). No player finished under par on the final day: the average round was 78.7.The place is in better nick this week, and the fairways have been widened since then. But for goodness sake keep those tee shots down the middle ... because the rough is gloriously punitive in the time-honoured US Open style. That could be good news for Henrik Stenson, leading the driving accuracy charts right now ... but not so good for Lefty, whose hopes of finally completing the career slam aren’t helped by his off-the-tee ranking of 201 out of 205. Or Tiger, whose big stick has him down in 185th place. On the flip side, all three winners of the US Open during modern times have been older, more experienced players. Goosen was 35. So was Corey Pavin in 1995. And the legendary Ray Floyd was 43 when he won here in 1986. A good omen for Phil, Sergio Garcia, Tiger and Justin Rose, then! Or perhaps the links course will benefit players who really like an Open Championship-style challenge? That might benefit the aforementioned Grace, who shot 62 at Birkdale last year, or Oosthuizen, Sergio, Rickie Fowler, Jason Day, Tommy Fleetwood and Rory McIlroy. And hey, we’ve got this far without mentioning the reigning Open champion Spieth, the current PGA champ Justin Thomas, the new Masters champion Patrick Reed ... and the defending Koepka, of course. There are many other obvious contenders, too, but look, we’ll be here all day. This promises to be quite a week in Southampton, NY. Do you feel a bit flushed? Yes, us too. That’ll be the golf fever running high. Emergency! Emergency!

What are the alternatives? I recently upgraded to a used early-2015 MacBook Pro Retina because of Apple’s recent redesign of the MacBook Pro, which sliced off a little bit of thickness at the cost of various ports and the very reliable keyboard with scissor mechanism. Apple is facing class-action lawsuits over the new butterfly keyboards’ untimely breakage, and as my computer’s main job is to be a writing tool, I didn’t want to risk ending up with non-functional keys. Also, I have tried the new keyboard and I did not like the feel of it: travel seems too short and rather “flat” for my taste.However, I find laptop keyboards across all platforms are becoming flatter and slimmer, and the only ones that appear to offer mechanical keyboards are flashy gaming laptops. There aren’t any for writers.A comfortable typing experience could distinguish professional laptops from tablets and Ultrabooks, but Apple appears to be muddying that distinction. Why is that, and is there a chance it will change again? JuliaAll laptop manufacturers have been making their products thinner and lighter since British industrial designer Bill Moggridge invented the format with the GRiD Compass in 1982. However, keyboard quality didn’t start to decline dramatically until we reached the ultra-light class with the Sony X505 in 2004 and Apple’s influential MacBook Air in 2008. Both had mediocre keyboards by the standards of the day, though they don’t look all that bad in hindsight.At the time, my own portable writing tools – an IBM ThinkPad 240X and, later, a ThinkPad X31 – sacrificed both floppy and optical drives to save size and weight but they didn’t compromise on keyboard quality. In fact, ThinkPads had great keyboards right up to the X220 (2011) and similar machines. A newer, thinner design – good but not quite great – appeared in the X230 and later models. (See my earlier answer: Which ThinkPad laptops have the best keyboards?)In fact, a refurbished ThinkPad X220 with an Intel Core i5-2520M processor would still be a great writing tool for less than £200. You could make it even better with upgrades to 8GB of memory and a 120GB SSD for less than £300. It’s chunky by today’s standards but not impossibly heavy at 1.5kg.I don’t expect the pendulum to swing back. Consumers really like thin-and-light laptops, and they are choosing them based on styling, screen size, storage space, speed and price, rather than their keyboards. Even if they try a few in John Lewis, Currys PC World or a local computer store, they’re mainly evaluating one poor keyboard against another.Mass-market buyers clearly don’t value keyboard quality, either because they can’t touch-type or because their main applications don’t require much typing. If you really want a better keyboard, you should look at business laptops, where the main suppliers are Lenovo (ThinkPad), Dell (Latitude, Precision) and HP (Elitebook, ProBook, ZBook).And the problem is that almost all Apple devices are designed for consumers, not for businesses, even though you can use them for business purposes. The latest MacBook Pro made that clear by not providing what business users wanted and by including lots of things they didn’t. This led to a backlash from professional users, though I’m not sure it affected sales.In 2013, Apple messed up the design of the Mac Pro, delivering a trashcan to people who needed something they could expand and upgrade, such as the old “cheese grater” tower. It took Apple years to realise its mistake, and now it won’t launch a new “modular” Mac Pro until 2019.Apple must know it has messed up the design of the MacBook Pro but a proper redesign would take time. The next version – which wasn’t announced at this month’s Apple developer conference – may just try to alleviate the keyboard’s problems with dust and debris.The real problem with laptops is that they are not ergonomic, so they are unsuitable for sustained work, regardless of the quality of the built-in keyboard. Professionals who do full-time keyboard work are either using desktop PCs or all-in-ones (such as Apple’s iMac), or they are using their laptops like desktops. They are putting the laptop on a riser to lift the screen and plugging in an external USB keyboard, which makes the quality of the laptop’s keyboard less important.Not-so-smart people who do sustained work on laptops tend to end up needing physiotherapy, like me. Bad habits can take years to catch up with you but plenty of people have worked through pain or been left unable to work at all. (See: How can I use laptops and tablets without suffering from physical pains?)If you use an external keyboard, it makes sense to choose an ergonomic model that splits the keys. This reduces the amount of wrist twisting required. Basically, the healthiest typing position is one where the hands are close to straight and flat, and aligned with your wrists and arms.Avoid keyboards with numeric keypads, or at least make sure that the alphabetical keys (TY, GH, BN) are central, or you may end up twisting your right wrist more than your left wrist.There are lots of reviews of ergonomic keyboards to help you choose one that should suit you. My next buy will be a Kinesis Freestyle Pro with – finally! – mechanical keys, when it reaches the UK.Most ergonomic keyboards don’t travel well. One exception is the Goldtouch Go! 2 mobile travel keyboard, which works in a tented position and also folds up. The keys look pretty flat in photographs, but it might appeal to someone who is developing RSI problems.As you say, there are several gaming laptops with mechanical keyboards. The idea was pioneered by MSI in 2015 with the GT80 Titan with an 18.5in screen. It used full-size Cherry MX keys. The following year, Razer launched a relatively sleek 17.3in Razer Blade Pro with a 4K-resolution 17.3in screen and “the world’s first ultra-low-profile mechanical keyboard,” developed in-house.You’re unlikely to see many in your local Starbucks.However, there is hope. This year, Cherry announced a new MX Low Profile RGB switch, which reduces the total key height from 18.5mm to 11.9mm. The key still provides 3mm of travel, which is less than an old-style IBM Model M keyboard but better than the 1mm-2mm you get with a really flat keyboard.Cherry says that the new switches “can be used just as easily for mechanical keyboards in high-end notebooks as for unusually thin mechanical desktop keyboards,” but I expect they’ll mainly be used in gaming laptops. They also have RGB coloured lights so they probably wouldn’t appeal to Apple.You’ve just bought an early-2015 MacBook Pro Retina with a far higher spec than you need for writing – 2.7GHz, 16GB, 512GB – so it should be several years before you think about replacing it. By that time, Apple might be shipping better keyboards. If not, check out some of the business ranges mentioned above, rather than the consumer models.While China’s Lenovo bought IBM’s ThinkPad ision in 2005, I assume it will keep up the tradition of shipping above-average keyboards, even if they’re not in the 240X class. Something from the current ThinkPad T range, such as the T470, might suit you. It’s more of a workhorse than the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. If you want something more like a MacBook or MacBook Air, the HP Envy and Asus ZenBook ranges generally have decent keyboards, but with the key-travel more common with thin-and-light laptops.Have you got a question?

It said it expects the tiny wood-framed house marked with peeling paint to fetch seven figures.The house, owned by Parks’s brother, was abandoned and set for demolition in Detroit before Parks’s niece, Rhea McCauley, bought it for $500 and donated it to the American artist Ryan Mendoza in an attempt to preserve the legacy of the civil rights activist. Mendoza shipped it to his home in Berlin and reassembled it in his yard, where it drew a steady stream of visitors.Mendoza brought it back to the US this year for a temporary exhibit in Rhode Island, but he had been searching for a permanent home. The delicate structure should only be rebuilt one more time, he said.“It’s a wonderful way to present the house again to the American people. Let them decide what this house is worth,” Mendoza said. “I hope it ends up in the hands of somebody who loves Rosa Parks. I hope it will be on public display.”The pieces of the house, currently in Providence, will be taken in two, 40ft (12 metre) shipping containers to a storage area in Massachusetts on Friday, Mendoza said.Parks moved to Detroit in 1957, two years after refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white passenger in Montgomery, Alabama. Her family says Parks stayed in her brother’s home with 17 other relatives.Arlan Ettinger, of Guernsey’s auctioneers, said the house was not much to look at but is a “national treasure” for what it represents. Guernsey’s handled the sale of Parks’ personal archives after her death for $4.5m, and Ettinger noted that collection is now in the Library of Congress. He said that “almost guarantees that nothing of hers of any importance will ever surface again” for sale.“As the guy who sold a guitar recently for nearly $4m, a baseball for nearly $3m, there is no baseball, no guitar as important as this house,” he said.The proceeds from the sale will go in part to a foundation set up by McCauley to help preserve her aunt’s legacy, Mendoza and Guernsey’s said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fec4cd6cfa397e0310cdded3c8924d17e74baf1/0_30_900_540/master/900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49835c27439159d86ac239e99ee0bde8","title":"us army pennsylvania native american children","story":"Remains of four children who died at government-run school in Pennsylvania more than 100 years ago being disinterredThe remains of four Native American children who died more than 100 years ago at a government-run Carlisle Indian industrial school they were obliged to attend in Pennsylvania were being disinterred Thursday so they can start the long journey home to their Native families scattered thousands of miles away across the American west.The US army started the process on Thursday at the cemetery on the grounds of the Carlisle barracks, which also houses the US army war college, but used to be the site of the so-called Carlisle Indian industrial school. The institution acted as an off-reservation boarding school in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where Native American children were sent from their tribal territories in western states, in order to be “Americanized”. The exhumations are expected to be completed in early July.The children being exhumed include 10-year-old Little Plume, of the Northern Arapaho George Ell, of the Blackfeet Nation Herbert Little Hawk, of the Oglala Sioux and Her Pipe Woman, also known as Dora Brave Bull, of the Standing Rock Sioux. The remains will be transferred to the children’s descendants in Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, who requested the exhumations.“The army’s commitment remains steadfast to the four Native American families whose sacrifice is known to only a few. Our objective is to reunite the families with their children in a manner of utmost dignity and respect,” said Karen Durham-Aguilera, the executive director of army national military cemeteries. The remains of 15-year-old Little Chief, also known as Dickens Nor, and 14-year-old Horse, also called Horace Washington, were returned to the Northern Arapaho last year. They were reburied in Wyoming’s Wind River reservation.In the early 1880s the children attended the school founded by an army officer where they were forced students to cut their long hair, dress in uniforms, speak English and adopt European names. It’s unclear how the iniduals concerned died, although infectious disease and harsh conditions caused other deaths at the school. More than 10,000 children were taught at the school.

In Leipzig, in eastern Germany, Alexander’s distraught mother had handed her precious child to a stranger on a train, desperate to save him from the horrors that lay ahead.The Kindertransport carrying young Jewish refugees from Nazi Europe began at the end of 1938. Alexander arrived in Harwich the following July, six weeks before the outbreak of the second world war. Now 80, he has no recollection of the journey.But next week he will retrace it by bicycle with his son and grandson, along with other descendants of Jews who arrived in the UK on a scheme that saved an estimated 10,000 lives.Forty-two cyclists will leave Berlin on Sunday and arrive in Harwich on a ferry from the Hook of Holland next Friday. There they will begin the final leg of their 600-mile journey to Liverpool Street station in the city of London, where a ceremony will be held in front of a statue depicting young Jewish refugees.The bike ride, organised by World Jewish Relief, is to commemorate the 80th anniversary later this year of the first Kindertransport to arrive in the UK.In the days after Kristallnacht, a pogrom against Jews in Nazi Germany in November 1938, Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister, agreed to the temporary admission of unaccompanied, mostly Jewish, children from Germany and elsewhere.They were placed in foster homes, schools, hostels and farms, and many were the only members of their families to survive the Holocaust. Among those saved was Alf Dubs, later a Labour MP and now a peer, who in recent years has campaigned for the UK to admit unaccompanied refugees from Syria and other conflict zones.Alexander said: “For me, this is a sort of victory ride. A victory in the sense that I survived and I’ve had a good life. I came out of the Nazi terror to freedom and safety, and to me this is a victory.”In 1938, his father was taken to Buchenwald concentration camp, and his mother – who had already lost two babies in childbirth – took the “terribly, terribly difficult decision” to send her only child to safety.“She must have thought, ‘I have to do whatever I can to save this boy’. She put me on a train not knowing if she’d ever see me again. It’s hard to imagine what was going through her head,” said Alexander.He was taken to a home for refugee children near London. Meanwhile, his father was released from Buchenwald on condition he left Germany. He went to the UK, where he was interned in a camp. His mother also made it to England, arriving destitute on 1 September 1939, the day war commenced.The family was reunited when Alexander was four or five, and eventually settled in Leeds. Alexander, who has three children and nine grandchildren, later moved to Israel. Later this month, he will meet the Duke of Cambridge on the first official visit by a member of the royal family to Israel and Palestine.The octogenarian will be cycling with his son, Nadav, and 14-year-old grandson, Daniel, with his wife travelling in a support vehicle. “I’m determined to do it. I’m very active – swimming, tennis, cycling – and I’ve been training. I think I’m capable, and it’s going to be an awesome experience.”Ian Goldsmith, 56, another cyclist, only discovered his full family history when he applied for a German passport last year in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. He found out his father Saloman, then 13, and uncle Bruno, 12, were on the first Kindertransport that arrived in Harwich in December 1938. The boys’ mother had died of breast cancer, and their father was later killed in a death camp.Saloman, who died in 1977, “never spoke about his background, and I never asked”, said Goldsmith. “The only inkling I had was that he made me watch a documentary about the Holocaust when I was about 10.”The brothers were the only ones of 14 cousins, aunts and uncles to survive the Nazi persecution.Phil Harris is making the 600-mile ride in memory of his grandmother, Ilse, who arrived in Britain with one small suitcase at the age of 16 – one of the oldest children saved by the Kindertransport.The night before setting off, Harris will sleep in his grandmother’s former family home in Berlin, now marked with a stolpersteine, a brass plaque in the ground commemorating Nazi victims. “I thought it would be a nice touch to start this journey from the point where Granny started her journey,” he said.World Jewish Relief, set up in 1933, helped find homes in the UK for Jewish refugee children, and has continued to provide humanitarian relief around the world. The bike ride was “a tribute to the amazing life-saving work of our predecessors and to the people who they saved. Tens of thousands of people would not be alive today were it not for their heroism,” said Rafi Cooper of WJR."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43676c231f5643615c7f4d30bef5479d513a6b3e/0_289_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e371dd43490f7625b16eb3d4ac1f7de","title":"north korea sanctions to stay until full denuclearisation says us","story":"US secretary of state contradicts North Korean media reports of ‘step-by-step and simultaneous action’Tough sanctions against North Korea will remain in place until its complete denuclearisation, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has said, apparently contradicting North Korea’s view that the process agreed at this week’s summit would be phased and reciprocal.The US president, Donald Trump, and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, issued a joint statement after their Singapore meeting reaffirming the North’s commitment to “work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, while Trump “committed to provide security guarantees”.After meeting his Chinese counterpart in Beijing on Thursday, Pompeo said Washington had “made very clear that the sanctions and the economic relief that North Korea will receive will only happen after the full denuclearisation, the complete denuclearisation of North Korea.”Pompeo said China, Japan and South Korea all acknowledged that a corner had been turned on the Korean peninsula issue, but all three also acknowledged that sanctions remained in place. After the summit on Tuesday, China had suggested international sanctions on its neighbour and ally could be lifted. “China has reaffirmed its commitment to honouring the UN security council resolutions. Those have mechanisms for relief contained in them, and we agreed that at the appropriate time that those would be considered,” Pompeo said, standing next to the Chinese government’s top diplomat, the state councillor, Wang Yi.Wang said China has consistently supported the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and Beijing would continue to play “a constructive role” in the process. He said it was impossible to solve the issue overnight.Earlier on Thursday, Pompeo said after meeting South Korea’s president and Japan’s foreign minister in Seoul: “We are going to get complete denuclearisation only then will there be relief from the sanctions.”North Korean state media reported on Wednesday that Kim and Trump had recognised the principle of “step-by-step and simultaneous action” to achieve peace and denuclearisation.The summit statement provided no details on when North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons programme or how the dismantling might be verified.Sceptics of how much the meeting achieved pointed to the North Korean leadership’s long-held view that nuclear weapons are a bulwark against what it fears are US plans to overthrow it and unite the Korean peninsula.However, the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, said the world, through the summit, had escaped the threat of war, echoing Trump’s upbeat assessment of his meeting with Kim.“What’s most important was that the people of the world, including those in the United States, Japan and Koreans, have all been able to escape the threat of war, nuclear weapons and missiles,” Moon told Pompeo.Pompeo insisted North Korea was committed to giving up its nuclear arsenal but said it would “be a process, not an easy one”.Kim understood that getting rid of his nuclear arsenal needed to be done quickly and there would be relief from stringent UN sanctions only after its “complete denuclearisation”, Pompeo said.Moon later said South Korea would be flexible when it came to military pressure on North Korea if it was sincere about denuclearisation.Also on Thursday, North and South Korea held their first military talks in more than a decade. The talks followed on from an inter-Korean summit in April at which Moon and Kim agreed to defuse tension and cease “hostile acts”.After Tuesday’s summit with Kim, Trump told a news conference he would end joint US-South Korean military exercises. Japan has reacted to that move with concern, saying the drills were vital for east Asian security.Tokyo is working on arranging a meeting between the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and Kim, with one possibility being an Abe visit to Pyongyang around August, the Yomiuri newspaper reported.The US intelligence assessment of the nuclear and other military threats posed by North Korea remained unchanged despite Trump’s and Moon’s assertions about the North Korean nuclear threat being over, a senior US official responsible for studying the North Korean military said. US officials said it was unclear what types of training involving US and South Korean troops might cross into Trump’s now forbidden zone of “war games”.  “Make no mistake, we are going to maintain the readiness of our forces in South Korea,” said one US official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official acknowledged, however, it was still not certain how that was going to happen. The US maintains about 28,500 soldiers in South Korea, which remains in a technical state of war with the North after the 1950-53 Korean war ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty.Meanwhile, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, asked a North Korean official, Kim Yong-Nam, at their meeting on Thursday to pass an invitation to Kim Jong-un to visit Russia in September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49d333eb902e104674ddd68922af9be7b7daf424/0_223_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63dfc234e93a13de3ab022f35424a23d","title":"poland family life photography exhibition in pictures","story":"Family Values: Polish Photography Now is the UK’s first exhibition focusing on photography from Poland and part of the Calvert 22 Foundation’s season of events examining the country’s visual culture and creative landscape.

Photograph: John ThysjohnGetty ImagesLast year’s Ryanair flights fiasco featured prominently on Thursday’s higher-level business paper in a well-received exam which teachers said was very fair. Students were presented with a brief note about the cancellation of Ryanair flights last September after Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary admitted he “messed up the planning of pilots’ holidays”.It was followed by a curt note asking students to explain the term “contingency plan” and to “outline the importance of planning for an airline such as Ryanair”.Pádraig Doherty, a spokesman for the Business Studies Teachers Association of Ireland and teacher at Moyne Community College in Longford, said the paper was well-pitched. “It wasn’t too easy, and there was enough for students of all abilities. It was also a paper that required more than regurgitation of rote learned material, with a lot of critical thinking required,” he said.Mr Doherty said the most challenging question asked students about the difficulties that increased employment presents for the Irish economy, but that it was a good chance for the stronger students to shine.“In terms of Irish businesses, the Ryanair cancellation of flights doesn’t get much more topical, relevant and practical. “Supermac’s cropped up on a reasonably straightforward question on franchising. “The applied business questions asked students about the opportunities presented for a bike hire business on a Greenway which students will have found interesting and easy to relate to.”Ruairí Farrell, a teacher at Coláiste Chraobh Abhann in Kilcoole, Co. Wicklow and subject representative for the TUI, said some of the short questions were “quite wordy and text-heavy, but there was a good mix of questions so they had a lot of choice.”He said a question on how credit unions work as a cooperative was a nice challenge for the more capable student.Keith Hannigan, a business teacher at the Institute of Education, said it was a lovely paper. “It gave students a nice, positive start with excellent short questions and a lovely applied business question. The long questions were all fair,” he said.“The paper rewarded students who had studied the whole course and not just relied on past papers for their revision. The short questions were the nicest ever. Question seven, about Cadbury’s and extending a product’s life cycle, was gorgeous.”The ordinary level-paper was clear and to the point, said Mr Farrell. “The students knew what was expected with each of the questions and the whole course was examined.” Mr Doherty said that the paper required a good knowledge of key business terms and concepts and that there was “no scope for waffle.”With 17,373 students, business is one of the most popular of all non-compulsory subjects at Leaving Cert level.Try this at home: Leaving Cert business, higher levelRyanair CEO, Michael O’Leary, has apologised for the cancellation of flights.

File photograph: Collins CourtsCervical cancer patient Vicky Phelan has said the drug treatment she has been undergoing appears to be working and her tumours have shrunk significantly.Ms Phelan settled a High Court action against a US lab in April after her cancer was missed in a smear test three years before she was diagnosed with the disease. The test was taken as part of the CervicalCheck programme.The missed smear test was discovered in 2014, after her cancer diagnosis, but she was not told about it until 2017.A follow-up HSE investigation found that 209 women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer were not told about subsequent audits showing past smear tests through CervicalCheck had missed their cancers.Following a CT scan earlier this week, Ms Phelan received a call from her oncologist David Fennelly to say her tumour has had significant shrinkage since she started the drug Pembrolizumab in April.Ms Phelan said: “I said: ‘If this is bad news, I really don’t want to know.’ He nearly cut across me, he said: ‘Absolutely not, Vicky.’ He was bursting to tell me, to be honest. He said: ‘This is just absolutely fantastic news and you’re just absolutely not going to believe it.’ He said there is significant shrinkage in your tumours.”Ms Phelan has had three doses of the drug since April. “My stomach has gone down, I’m not in pain anymore.” she said. She said that, unlike chemotherapy, this drug does not flood the system with toxins. Instead, it helps the person’s own immune system to identify the cancer in the tumours and attack the disease itself.Ms Phelan, who is terminally ill, said she is realistic about her situation and does not see this drug as a cure for her cancer. However, she said she believes it may allow her to manage the disease long-term.She said only about 100 people in the country are on the drug at the moment and all are on clinical trials.“It took nine weeks of blood, sweat and tears fighting for it. I just wasn’t going to take no for an answer,” she said. “When you’re put in a situation like mine, when you’re given a terminal diagnosis and nobody gives you any hope, you know, you’ll do whatever you have to do to get the drug if you think it’s going to work,” she said.

Photograph: David SleatorThe public will be able to use most libraries seven days a week from between 8am and 10pm under new plans to double the number of visitors over the next five years.Nearly 200 of the State’s 330 public libraries will open for longer, while the public will be able to take and return books when the libraries are unmanned using scanners.The extended hours will give members more opportunities to study, use wifi, hold meetings and, in some cases, use libraries’ free “hot-desking” facilities to work remotely from offices.Meanwhile, fines for overdue items are to be abolished, while up to 40 libraries are to upgraded by the end of 2022, according to Tom Enright, the chair of the Libraries Development Committee.Longer opening hours and self-service technology was piloted in Tullamore and Banagher, Co Offaly, which resulted in increased visitor numbers of between 75 and 185 per cent over a 12-month period in 2016.Libraries will continue to be fully staffed during normal working hours and there will be no decrease in staffing hours. Indeed, 100 extra librarians are to be hired in coming monthsThe plan, which will be backed by nearly €5 million from the Government and local authorities, aims to double library membership from 750,000 to 1.5 million within the next five years.There are also wider plans to upgrade dozens of libraries, develop digital learning centres in all suitable libraries and position libraries as a community hub.Tom Enright, chief executive of Wexford County Council, who chairs the State’s Libraries Development Committee, said libraries had to respond to the way people live and work now.“Many people commute long distances to work and cannot get to the library between 9am and 5pm,” said Mr Enright.“It’s a shame to have these buildings closed, but 23 of them will be available to local communities outside of library hours and that number will be further expanded over the next five years,” he explained.Forty libraries will be improved over the next five years: “We expect to see a range of capital projects being developed to address the improvements required,” he went on.The recruitment of extra librarians – from county librarian to dozens in branches across the State – can be filled following a recent successful conciliation process with the public service union Fórsa.A bid to capture the interest of primary schoolchildren and older people in membership of 330 public libraries and 31 mobile ones is also in the pipeline, said Mr Enright.Libraries will stock more books about health to cope with greater interest in the subject from readers, who already make 17 million visits annually and borrow 18 million books, DVDs and journals.A grant of €400,000 last year, made through Healthy Ireland and the HSE, had enabled the library service to acquire a large number of health and medical-orientated books for its shelves.“We are confident of receiving further funding in the current year which would allow us to extend the range of health and medical-related material further,” he added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3530479.1528977858!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"royal visit to cork is it the musician prince","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrince Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall meet fishmonger Pat O’Connell as they visit the English Market. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty Images.We’re getting used to royal visits now. Nevertheless when Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall turn up at Cork’s English Market at 10.30 they are greeted by a horde of screaming school children.The Tánaiste earlier noted what a great opportunity the visit was to showcase the city and reinforced the fact that “we’ve moved on from the hang ups of the past.”Prince Charles has, in fact, been to Ireland a few times recently, Coveney said, but “now he’s come to the very best part of Ireland.”Cork people do love Cork. There’s an energetic brass band from the Music Generation playing great versions of Sweet Dreams, Seven Nation Army and I Want you Back while bouncing around in red t-shirts.“We only found out we were playing four days ago,” says 12-year-old Conor Redmond.“They royal family are so big,” says Redmond, “you don’t get bigger.”“It’s a real opportunity for us and for Cork,” says Caoimhe Barry, aged 17. “And Cork is the real capital like.”The Tánaiste, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed, Lord Mayor of Cork Tony Fitzgerald and his wife Georgina Fitzgerald and Ann Doherty chief executive of Cork City Council guide the royal couple around the Market.The royals spend the time chatting to stall holders before arriving at the back of the market to cut a cake celebrating its 230th year and unveil a plaque commemorating their visit.There’s an array of responses from traders and punters.“I don’t know much about him because I’m from Texas, ” says Virginia O’Gara, who is here showcasing the food from her vegan food company My Goodness. “Is it the musician, Prince?”“He’s very ecologically minded which is quite a good thing,” says her friend Lean Malone.“How much money is spent on these events is kind of problematic but it’s good for the market and good for Cork.”O’Gara has some fermented rain water that they want Charles and Camilla to try (Camilla later says she likes it). What do they want to say to Prince Charles? “My favourite album is Purple Rain,” says O’Gara. “I’m joking. I’m going to say that it’s the responsibility of people in positions of power to create a sustainable future for future generations.” She pauses. “Oh, and I’m going to convince him to go vegan”.On the way out a number of women dressed a little like Peig Sayers are waiting with a bouquet of paper flowers and a basket of traditional Irish food.“We’re the Coalquay Shawlies,” explains Liz Donavan. “Our families worked in the other market, the Irish Market. The English market was always for the posh people. We keep the heritage alive.”“They used to sell paper flowers like these,” says Breda Scanlon, showing me the roses. “And do you know where they kept their money?” I don’t. They all pull their skirts up to show old Irish punts beneath their stockings.“I’m going to ask Prince Charles if he wants a loan,” says Suzanne Dineen.“I’m going to offer to pay all the money they loaned us during the recession back” says Donovan.“I’m going to offer to exchange it for sterling,” says Breda Scanlon, and she does. Prince Charles finds it hilarious. They give him a basket of meat and he says he’ll try it.People are generally starstruck. Teresa Ross and Gwendoline Carroll are awed at having shaken the Prince’s hand.Carroll has a little Union Jack flag and has been to at least ten royal events – including the Queen mother’s hundredth birthday and the marriage of Will and Kate.She even camped out on the Mall after the death of Diana. “I’m a pure royalist,” she says.Accompanying the Prince and Duchess throughout their visit to the market is Pat O’Connell, the fishmonger who famously charmed the queen during her 2011 visit.O’Connell says he thinks the Prince loved the reception. “The kind of reception you only get in the English Market.”Did he make the Prince laugh this time? “We did. I told him we were at the spot where your mother threw your head back and laughed and so he’d better laugh. He did. He said his mammy told him he had to say hello to me.”Was it like the last time? “Ah, it was never going to be the same,” he says. “There’s only one queen.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3530283.1528975797!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm hector leaves 35 000 premises without power","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tESB crews are working to restore power after Storm Hector brought down trees in many areas. File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe .Some 35,000 premises have been left without power as a result of Storm Hector. The storm made landfall in the early hours of Thursday morning, bringing down trees which in turn brought down power lines. A status orange wind warning was issued for counties Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Sligo from 9pm on Wednesday to 10am on Thursday, with wind gusts of up to 125kmh.The counties most impacted include Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan. High spring tides are likely to coincide with the strongest winds, leading to a risk of coastal flooding and mountainous waves.Donegal Bay, Clew Bay in Co Mayo and Galway Bay were among the coastal areas most at risk.The highest wind speed was r at Mace Head, Galway, with a gust of 111 kmh recorded at 3am on Thursday morning. Mean wind speeds of between 65kmh and 80kmh were experienced at different stations on the west coast. ESB Network spokeswoman Bernardine Maloney said crews are mobilised and are working towards restoring power to all impacted families over the course of Thursday. She told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that it was mainly fallen trees that had caused the power outages across the country. The worst affected areas were in the North West.She pointed out that there was the added problem that the trees have summer foliage.However, she explained that in many instances one fallen tree was having an impact on numerous customers, so once that tree was cleared power could be restored swiftly.“We expect to have power back to everyone by this evening.”Northern Ireland Electric said that as of noon on Thursday, there were about 4, 000 customers still without power.In Donegal the N56 is impassable at Stragraddy in Termon due to a fallen tree. In Inishowen there is a fallen tree and electricity pole on the Gleneely Road (R238) in Moville. In Monaghan the N2 is down to one lane between Emyvale and Aughnacloy at Elvey due to a fallen tree. There is serious damage to the surface of the Ballybay Road (R183) outside Clones due to the severe weather. There are reports of trees being down in the midlands and a tree is blocking the Castlepollard-Delvin Road, the Portarlington road out of Tullamore and the Ratoath-Curragha road in Meath. There are also reports of a tree partially blocking the N4 eastbound at Enfield. The status orange warning remained in place for Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Sligo and a status yellow wind warning was in place for counties Dublin, Kildare, Longford, Louth, Offaly, Westmeath, Meath, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Roscommon, Clare and Kerry until 10am on Thursday. It is now located 300 nautical kilometres to the north of Ireland and the winds have started to die down.

But a further analysis of 500 obituaries from the Des Moines Register, a paper in Iowa, found the effect was more pronounced and religion was associated with an extra 6.48 years of life, suggesting living in a more religious area might have an extra effect.Religious participation often goes hand-in-hand with increased participation in activities and social groups, which might help tackle loneliness and sedentary lifestyles\u0026nbspthat could also shorten life expectancy.But analysis of activities mentioned in the report found this accounted for a fraction of the effect.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 950 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1050 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1250 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.1350 Fertility \u0027breakthrough\u0027 as human eggs grown in lab for first timeHuman eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments. 1450 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.1550 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1650 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded1750 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively1850 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.“We found that volunteerism and involvement in social organisations only accounted for a little less than one year of the longevity boost that religious affiliation provided,” said Laura Wallace, the study’s lead author.“There’s still a lot of the benefit of religious affiliation that this can’t explain.”The authors suggested that the remaining life expectancy might be a result of religious people being more likely to abstain from alcohol and drug use and other behaviours that could affect life expectancy – though these were not regularly recorded in obituaries.There also may be a benefit of “stress reducing practices” such as meditation, yoga or prayer, Dr Way added.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen.

Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities.

For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.”In another passage, he describes “bandit-like filthy Levantines” who board his ship during a stop at Port Said, Egypt.“In the harbour, a swarm of rowing boats with screaming and gesticulating Levantines of every shade, who lunge at our ship. As if spewed from hell,” he wrote.Ze’ev Rosenkranz, the book’s editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology, told : “I think a lot of comments strike us as pretty unpleasant – what he says about the Chinese in particular.“They’re kind of in contrast to the public image of the great humanitarian icon. I think it’s quite a shock to read those and contrast them with his more public statements. They’re more off guard, he didn’t intend them for publication.”In his preface to The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein, Mr Rosenkranz says the diaries exhibit a “quirky style” and “acerbic quips” but also contain some “troublesome entries”.“I began to ask myself: how could this humanist icon be the author of such passages?” Mr Rosenkranz writes.He adds it “seems clear that Einstein has bought - to some extent - into the perceived threat of ‘the yellow peril’,” referring to the racist colonial trope that the people of East Asia were a threat to the western world.Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, the\u0026nbspcosmologist, science writer and equality campaigner, said Einstein’s racism was “shocking and disappointing”.Even Einstein couldn\u0027t think of a peace planLegendary physicist Albert Einstein left letters that reveal his thoughts on the relationship between Arabs and JewsThe correspondence also includes a letter from Einstein’s former lover, Betty NeumannDuring the British mandate, Einstein engaged“I am both surprised and not surprised,” she tweeted. “Scientific ‘advance’\u0026nbspreally does not go in tandem with social advances. Sometimes scientific success drags racism along with its interlocutors.”Einstein toured Asia after being invited to speak in Japan shortly after being awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921.By contrast to his prejudice against the Chinese, Einstein speaks positively of the Japanese, who he praises as “unostentatious, decent, altogether very appealing”.His diaries from the period have previously only been published in German as part of the 15-volume Collected Papers of Albert Einstein.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And the discovery could shed lights on how planets form at their very earliest stages.Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered already, largely using the Kepler space telescope, which watches for the dips of light that they cause as they pass in front of their star. But protoplanets of this kind cannot be found using those techniques.Though thousands of exoplanets have been discovered in the last few decades, detecting protoplanets is at the frontier of science, said Christophe Pinte of Monash University in Australia and lead author on one of the two papers.The scientists found the planets by looking out for disturbances in the gas-filled disk around the star. They looked for a particular kind of light that is emitted by the movement of carbon monoxide – which allows them to understand how the gas in the disk is churning around.If there were no planets in the disk, then the gas would move with a simple, predictable pattern. But unusual movement would seem to suggest there is some large body there.It would take a relatively massive object, like a planet, to create localized disturbances in this otherwise orderly motion, said Pinte. Our new technique applies this principle to help us understand how planetary systems form.They saw three of those disturbances, each of which is thought to be caused by a different\u0026nbspplanet.There are other potential explanations for the strange data coming back from the star. But the new findings are the strongest evidence yet that there are new worlds forming in our own galactic neighbourhood.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

The sighting means\u0026nbspEid can begin.The holiday, considered one of the most important in the Islamic faith, has its own particular set of prayers, which Muslims will recite in congregation often in parks, community centres or at mosques.The exact dates of Ramadan and, in turn, Eid, vary\u0026nbspfrom one year to another on the Gregorian calendar.\u0026nbspThis year, Eid-al-Fitr could take place on 15 June, if the sighting of the crescent moon is made on the evening of 14 June.The festival is a day when Muslims thank Allah for strength and blessings, hoping Ramadan has brought them closer to god. It was first celebrated by Muhammad in 624CE\u0026nbspfollowing a victory in battle.A wide variety of practices take place during Eid, the first of which is a special set of prayers saved only for the occasion, known as Salat al-Eid.Muslims will generally gather at mosque or in open-air locations to carry out prayers on the first morning of the festival before sitting down with family and friends for breakfast, their first daylight meal in a month.Gatherings will take place in public areas across the UK to celebrate Eid, including in Trafalgar Square in central London, while up to 150,000 are expected to celebrate in\u0026nbspBirmingham’s Small Heath Park.In pictures: The first day of RamadanTurkish anti goverment protesters gather as they break their first day of fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Istiklal street in IstanbulA man sells prayer caps at his shop in Chaman, PakistanStudents sit in circles during a Quran recital class on the first day of the holy fasting month of RamadanAfghan children read and memorise the Koran at a mosque in Jalalabad Mosque workers prepare food for distribution to the poor and Muslims who come to break their fast at Noor Mosque in Nairobi, KenyaA Lebanese man prays at a mosque in Beirut, LebanonAnother important Eid tradition is the Zakat al-Fitr – charity given to the poor at the end of Ramadan.The donation is aimed at providing the needy with enough so they too can join in the feast and celebrate the breaking of the fast, but can be donated to help the poor or the needy in general.\u0026nbspDuring Ramadan 2016, British Muslims were estimated by the Charity Commission to have given £371 each to charity on average.Eid al-Fitr should not be confused with Eid al-Adha, the 10th day of the final month of the Islamic calendar and the holiest of all Muslim holidays, when Muslims from around the world will travel to Mecca for pilgrimage.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The most dangerous would be a mortal blow to the Government’s negotiating hand and could trigger a new election.Another one on Wednesday would be a giant step towards shackling ourselves forever inside an EU customs union, without any power over its decisions. That’s the worst possible Brexit, a catastrophe.Monday nights fudge between the two wings of the Tory party is still a risk — and merely postpones an inevitable showdown next month.In the end MPs must have faith in our great country, our extraordinary talent and our ability to thrive outside the EU. And, if they respect the democracy that has put them where they are, they must trust the decision we took.Todays “meaningful vote” amendment, if passed, would wreck the Government’s negotiating position in Brussels. That is already weak enough... Theresa May has made far too many compromises and is doing far too little to prepare Britain for a “no deal”. But this new move would be deadly.It would enable Parliament to reject any deal we strike with Brussels and force the Government to go back and keep negotiating. It would strip Mrs May of the power to walk away.The EU could offer us a derisory and punitive deal knowing Parliament had compelled the Government to accept it in the end. It would be like haggling with a used car salesman who knows you have to pay whatever he wants.The diehard Remainers running an orchestrated, multi-million pound campaign to keep Britain in the EU are relying on this vote to upend the process. It could trigger a second referendum or an election which Corbyn’s Marxist wrecking crew could win.Tory rebels must have nothing to do with it. It is their duty to give the Government the strongest possible hand in negotiating our exit and a future trade deal.Another vote on Wednesday seeks to push us into a restrictive customs union with the EU. That would place us permanently and powerlessly under Brussels’ control — with no say over it, nor any ability to sign our own deals around the world.Free trade with America, China, India, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? Forget it.Remain-backing MPs pretend this — and staying in the single market — represent “soft Brexit”, a compromise to reflect that 48 per cent voted Remain. But they are fatal to Brexit and they know it.Either would be a far worse deal than we have had before. They are a ruse to engineer a new vote to stay in.We get that Europhile MPs hate Brexit. But they are there to represent their voters, not advance personal agendas.For some Tories and many Labour MPs the decision should be blindingly obvious: their own constituencies voted Leave. The manifestos on which they then stood for election last year promised to leave both the single market and customs union.Do they seriously believe it right to betray their voters and their own doorstep promises?Most people are too busy to follow the daily ins and outs as the Brexit debate grinds on. Outside the London political bubble, they imagine it’s done and dusted. They just want to get on with leaving. And in full.It has barely occurred to them that many politicians never accepted the result, have waged war on it relentlessly and are closer than ever to victory.Imagine the explosion of anger if that happens. If, today or next month, Tory Remainers vote with Labour’s opportunists to defy the biggest democratic mandate in British history. If MPs, having approved the EU Withdrawal Bill once already, back wrecking amendments drafted by unelected peers bent on destroying Brexit.That rage won’t even be limited to Leavers. Many Remainers also consider it vital to fulfil the result of the vote in full. They know staying in the single market or customs union is not leaving. It is a suicidal, half-baked Brexit.Why would anyone trust our democracy again if we took such a course, in defiance of the referendum result?The Sun understands the Tory rebels’ fears for the economy and jobs post-Brexit. We believe we may well be in for a rocky ride short-term, before the longer-term benefits pan out.But everyone should read the authoritative view from ex-Aussie Prime Minister Tony Abbott — who initially backed Remain but is brimming with confidence over what he considers a golden opportunity for this country, even if we never strike any deal with Brussels.The Sun understands, too, the worries many Remainers have that Britain could become less ­liberal, less open and more prejudiced against foreign migrants after Brexit. We whole-heartedly believe that’s unfounded.Brits are becoming MORE welcoming, secure now in the knowledge we are at last about to get the same control over numbers every non-EU country enjoys.On these two ​vital days for Brexit — and further votes next month — The Sun says this to backbench Tories: Have faith in the people of Britain.They made the right decision on Brexit and they will make it work... if you allow your Government to give them the chance.THE most Eurosceptic people in Britain are calling on Theresa May to make good on her promise that Brexit means Brexit.The Lincolnshire town’s Tory MP Matt Warman was a Remainer but now advocates a “clean break” from Europe in agreement with 74.9 per cent of his constituents.Office worker Beverly Iles, 67, said: “We should have come straight out.

They didn’t want five years of hell.”Retailer Vicky Paddey, 37, said: “I voted for Brexit and I’m proud to say that — it was what people wanted then and they still want it now. If we end up with a soft Brexit, a lot of these shops in this city centre will not survive it.”IN the North East, some impatient voters are calling for dithering Mrs May to go.Voters in Gateshead went 56.8 per cent in favour of leaving in 2016, against the wishes of Labour MP Ian Mearns.Florist Dawn Athey, 41, said: “I think Theresa May should resign.“She’s not the person I thought she was going to be.“I think she’s scared of being the Prime Minister who’s going to take us out of the EU.”And Jude Ditchburn, 51, from Gateshead, said: “I think she is betraying the country and not doing what people want.FORMER Tory Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan is a leading Remoaner — but in her Leicestershire constituency people want to get on with Brexit.The area voted 50.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU.Brexit backer Andrew Cooper, 56, said: “They are dragging their feet, the people have voted for this and they need to do what the people asked them to do.”Cedric Hewitt, 90, said: “I think Theresa May ought to get her finger out and get on with it. It’s what the British people wanted.”And David Greasley, 85, a former quality control engineer, said: “I voted out and simply want out.”HARD Brexit opponent and Conservative MP Anna Soubry wants Britain to be shackled with a customs union.Now, they want her party to carry out their wishes.Ray James, 82, and Elsie James, 80, said: “We think the Government are failing to get things sorted. It is taking a long, long time and no people thought it would take this long.”John Wilson, 68, said the Government was clueless on disentangling from the single market. “It has become a shambles,” he added.TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston switched sides during the referendum campaign and became a Remainer.But she is out of step with her Devon constituency, where 53.9 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU.Christine Williams, 64, said she was disappointed with Dr Wollaston.“I don’t know if I can now vote for her in the next election,” she added.Butcher Chris McCabe, 70, blamed Theresa May for the slow progress.He said: “This is like the Champions League final and we are at half-time.“She still has a chance but she needs to get her team in order so they can go back out and win this.”WHILE the capital was the heartland of Remain, in Bromley, South London, there was a paper-thin majority of 50.6 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. Tory MP Bob Neill is a Remainer.Gardener David Alden, 52, said: “It’s been dragged out for a reason. They know how to grind people down and tire them out.

Endangered not only by parliamentarians who never really accepted the referendum result, but by the Government’s negotiating approach, which risks delivering an exit from the EU which fails to deliver the control Britons voted for.When, on June 23, 2016, 17.4million people went to the polls to vote for Britain to chart a new course for itself outside of the European Union, they would never have imagined that, almost two years on, Parliament would still be debating whether to keep this country as — essentially — a non-voting member of the EU.Or that their government would still not have set out a detailed blueprint for this country’s relationship with the EU once we have left. So what has gone wrong and who is to blame?There are TWO BASIC RULES of negotiation. Know what you want and do not go into a negotiation unless you are prepared to walk away.Theresa May’s government has FAILED BOTH OF THESE TESTS.Even now, the Government can not say what it wants Britain’s customs arrangements with the EU to be after Brexit. Instead, we’ll have to wait for two working groups to report back before the Cabinet makes up its mind.This failure to know what it is trying to achieve has hobbled Britain in these negotiations — and handed the initiative to the hardliners in the European Commission. Mrs May must take the blame for this.She should never have triggered Article 50, the two-year process for leaving the EU, until she had a clear and precise idea of what she wanted the exit deal to look like.It has also meant that, in the absence of clear UK aims, those conducting the negotiations have treated the whole thing as a damage-limitation exercise.As the Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has been sidelined in the talks in favour of the civil servant Olly Robbins, complains in private, the civil service is not suited to negotiating.It struggles to deal with European chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s take-it-or-leave-it tactics.But the biggest mistake has been the failure to rigorously prepare for no deal. Mrs May used to emphasise that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.But she has never followed through on that rhetoric. There has been no big national effort to get this country as ready as it could be to walk away from the talks.There is plenty of blame to go round for this. The Treasury — aided by the Chancellor Philip Hammond — has refused to make planning for no deal a priority.Why? Because it feared if there was a plan for no deal, the Brexiteers would end up using it. Better, it thought, to make minimal preparations for it to ensure the UK stayed at the negotiating table.But this got it ALL WRONG. The best way to avoid no deal was to plan for it. For WEAKNESS IS PROVOCATIVE. The EU looks at how unready Britain is to walk away and turns the screw.Would Michel Barnier’s team feel free to be so dismissive about Britain’s proposals if they thought we might simply walk out of the talks, taking our £39billion divorce payment with us?It is worth remembering that a report from the House of Lords, hardly a hotbed of Brexiteer sentiment, concluded that Britain was under no legal obligation to pay ANYTHING AT ALL to the EU on leaving.The Government risks being left with the most unpalatable of choices: No deal or stay in a customs union with the EU and the European Economic Area, leaving Britain as, effectively, a non-voting member of the EU.Senior EU figures think they can do this because they do not see any serious attempt by the UK to properly prepare for no deal.If this country had made preparations for going it alone that were so big they were visible from the other side of the Channel, the EU would be engaging in the negotiations in a far more constructive manner and Britain would be on course to secure a much better deal.Leave-supporting Cabinet ministers can not escape their share of the blame for this, either.They should have been far more assertive and pushed for serious no deal planning.They should have insisted that Cabinet was updated every fortnight on Britain’s preparedness to walk away without a deal.They should have demanded that the Government had serious and credible contingency plans to deal with disruption to cross-Channel trade. They should have told Mrs May they would resign if Hammond would not provide the funds necessary to make no deal planning a reality.But there is, as the minutes of the Brexit Inner Cabinet’s most recent meeting make clear, another reason why “EU ministers had no fear of no deal”.They “observed the UK Parliament and prominent Remainers, who had formed a cross-party alliance against Brexit, and thought there was no chance of no deal”.Too many MPs voted for a referendum on our EU membership, then were not prepared to genuinely accept the result when they lost. Too many Tories were prepared to stand at last year’s General Election on a manifesto of leaving the single market and the customs union that they were not actually committed to. That is not being straight with the voters.One of the other reasons EU ministers are not worried about no deal is Mrs May’s loss of the Tory majority in that snap election.Ever since Britain voted for Brexit, the EU has feared the emergence of an alternative economic model on its doorstep.It worried Britain might become a hyper-competitive, low-tax economy 26 miles off its coastline.They expected that Britain would respond to no deal by slashing taxes and regulation to make up for the failure to strike a trade deal with the EU. This gave the EU an incentive to come to an agreement with us.But when the Tory majority disappeared, so did this fear. It is clear this hung parliament does not have the stomach for such a course.Indeed, Mr Hammond said in Germany in January that we would change our “economic model” if we could not get a good trade deal, then took that threat off the table in a visit to France the month after the election. He, unhelpfully, told the French press we would keep up the European economic model even after Brexit.The next big British mistake has been its handling of the Irish border issue. The history of Northern Ireland meant this subject needed to be treated with care. A return to every vehicle being stopped would clearly have been a recipe for trouble.But Britain should never have agreed in December that no new physical infrastructure at the border meant there could not even be number plate recognition cameras.The decision to rule these out has made it far harder to use technology to try to solve the border issues and has been grist to the mill of those who want to use Northern Ireland as a device to keep the whole of the UK in a customs union and “high alignment” with the EU and unable to strike comprehensive free-trade deals with other countries.The Government now finds itself urging the EU to accept a UK-wide “backstop” in an attempt to try to get beyond the Irish border issue knowing that the EU will break off trade talks before they have really begun if there is not progress on this.This backstop, though, is not a good deal for the UK. It would see Britain stuck in a customs union with the EU and following all of Brussels’ rules on goods, yet with no say in making them. It would provide a trade solution for goods, where the EU sells £135billion more to us than we do to them, but not for services, where we sell £92billion more to them.In these circumstances, would the EU really be rushing to complete a trade deal with us? Of course not. It would be in their interest to drag things out, knowing that the backstop would remain in place.If the House of Commons votes for the House of Lords amendment to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU or to take no deal off the table, it will weaken Britain’s negotiating position still further.It will make it almost inevitable that the only deal Brussels is prepared to offer Britain would leave this country as, essentially, a non-voting member of the EU.The Government has made many mistakes in its handling of these negotiations. But this is no excuse for Parliament to compound these errors.MPs should reject these amendments today and the House of Lords should respect the will of the elected House of Commons when the bill returns to it.Then, the Government should get its act together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Brexit that leaves it half in, half out and subject to EU rules it has no say over would be a disaster but that’s what seeking a deal at any price will lead to.As one of Britain’s many friends abroad, please accept my assurance that you don’t need a customs union to prosper.Without being in a customs union with Europe, and without any free trade deal with it, Australia does nearly $100billion a year in trade with Europe.In the two years of my prime minister-ship, Australia finalised free trade deals with our three biggest export markets: China, Japan and South Korea.So my advice to Britain is: Stop fretting! It IS possible to trade successfully under the WTO rules which already govern 55 per cent of Britain’s exports and it IS possible to do good deals with your main trading partners once you are free to do so, as Australia’s experience abundantly demonstrates.Let’s say, out of spite, the EU refuses to offer Britain a satisfactory bargain.Britain already imports goods from Europe free of tariffs and quotas. Britain already recognises European standards and credentials. Just declare that you will continue to do so.Trade from Europe to Britain would be absolutely free. And even if the Europeans — in an attempt to hurt Britain that would actually damage them — apply the same tariffs to Britain as they do to the US, the fall in the Pound would make British exports at least as competitive in Europe as they are now.Britain should still be the best place from which to export to Europe or to service Europe — because it has the freest markets, a can-do culture and will no longer have EU officials trying to harmonise away its competitive advantage.No new Brussels directives will apply in the UK. British courts will no longer be subject to European ones. And Britain need no longer admit everyone with an EU passport.Importantly, Britain will be able to strike trade deals with anyone it chooses without waiting for 27 other countries to sign up too.The coming Britain-Australia Free Trade Agreement should mean a dramatic increase in trade opportunities between our two countries without disadvantaging anyone else.First, there should be no tariffs or quotas on any goods traded between our two countries — there should be no exceptions, no carve outs, nothing. And second, there should be full recognition of each country’s credentials and standards.Because Australia and Britain are like-minded countries with similar systems and comparable standards of living, there should be no need for tortuous negotiation and labyrinthine detail.After all, Brit and Australian workers enjoy similar protections in the workplace: So why should they need elaborate protections against each other?Britain and Australia have comparable attitudes to job qualifications and product and service standards, so why should British rules be insufficient for Australia and vice versa?And Britons and Australians already have more than 200 years’ experience of each other, so why not allow them more freely to travel and work in each other’s country?This could be a template for the trade deals Britain could swiftly do with New Zealand and Singapore.On a similar basis, Britain could seek to join NAFTA, (North American Free Trade Agreement) which could become the North Atlantic Free Trade Area — and perhaps open to other free market economies seeking to escape the regulatory restraints and statism of the EU.Brexit could begin a process leading to genuinely freer global trade, rather than protectionist trade blocs.Brexit is a wonderful opportunity for Britain and the wider world — if only British leaders are prepared to make the most of it.So go for it Britain, for all our sakes!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An endless, choking diet of documentaries, live events, lectures, news items and outright bollockings, from the BBC, all to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.Not one of which had as much impact as Love Island’s “Girl Power” task on ITV2, involving super-hero capes, bikinis, large items of fruit and narrator Iain Stirling explaining: “The girls will squish melons with their bums. Slowest girl to crush her melon is out of the contest.”Just part of the reason I adore a show which pricks pomposity and political correctness like ­nothing else on British television and is dedicated to no other purpose than entertaining its viewers. That’s the ideal, anyway.The reality’s been a bit more disappointing, so far, probably due to the excessive hype and sense of deja vu with contestants on either half of the gender divide.Both operate a squad rotation system, of course, but among the main players on the blokes’ side, we have painfully shy ­doctor Alex, with all the presence of a fire extinguisher, Jack who “got his teeth in Turkey”, possibly by ripping them from a feral mountain goat’s mouth, and this year’s comedy figure Niall, who’s “an investment for the future”, a bit like Betamax video tapes, and “multi-layered”, like a landfill site.Click here to play our Love Island games - and win a £10,000 holiday for you and three friendsThere’s the compulsory personal trainer, as well, of course — Adam, who seems to have the run of the females, plus strong silent type Wes and fluffy-haired Eyal, pronounced “Eeeeh-al”, “Oooh-all”, or just “Aaaah-sole”, if you prefer.Quite the ­profound one, is Eyal, forever banging on about “auras” and his spirituality while insisting: “I want to find someone here with depth.”A claim which, surely, represents the very height of human optimism given the most profound question all of the girls were asking last week was: “Where’s your head at?”In Kendall’s case, it was “literally all over the place”. One of her eyes was in Majorca, another in Ibiza and her ­forehead was somewhere in the Cote d’Azur. She’s gone though now, leaving, among significant others: Samira, Georgia, Rosie, super- manipulative Hayley and Laura, a former air stewardess who’s ­covered in more make-up than the giraffe in a theatre ­production of The Lion King.Most of the hype, however, has centred around the ­presence of Dani Dyer, the daughter of EastEnders actor Danny Dyer. But you knew that already, didn’t you, possibly because you read it in the paper and possibly because you saw her perform exactly the same big reveal on ITV2’s Survival Of The Fittest a couple of months ago. A doubling up that blows my mind, frankly.Because you expect hit shows to be copied by other fringe channels.What you don’t expect is ITV2 to abuse the basic law of ­supply and demand by copying its own format. A move that doesn’t help Love Island at all. It stops it being an event, in fact, and just makes viewers think this sort of crap is on all year.Personally, I think that’s a shame. Love Island genuinely deserves to be a huge success again. Not only is it one of the funniest and most UN-PC shows on TV, it’s also a series that can actually make you feel glad to be old and half-crippled by your medical complaints, rather than the youthful insecurity and stupidity which has gripped this bunch, who really did surpass themselves, on Friday.Georgia: “What do you think of Brexit?”Hayley: “What’s that?”“We’re leaving the EU so things like welfare and, like, things we trade with would all be cut down.”“So that means we wouldn’t have any trees?”“Cheese?” “No, trees.” “Oh.”Emmeline Pankhurst, your work here on Earth was not in vain.(Love Island, ITV2, 9pm).HAVING discovered Danny Dyer is the rightful heir to the English throne, BBC1 really should’ve knocked it on the head with Who Do You Think You Are?Until such time as one of the researchers can prove Danniella Westbrook is the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty and the Imperial Highness of all Russia.So they must have been flipping cartwheels at HQ when they discovered the great-great-grandmother of this week’s guest, ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan had her birth certificate signed by registrar Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes.A much greater honour, in the Beeb’s book, than three wise men and some shepherds turning up at your crib, but a detail that was probably as dull as ditch water for most viewers.The far more interesting thing to emerge during the hour, I thought, was Michelle’s own staggering ignorance of life, the world and everything.She had, for instance, no idea where Genoa was and gave a genuinely staggering response when a local historian told her: “By 1940 your family will have been torn apart, like every other family in Gibraltar, at the time.”“Why?”(Pause) “The Second World War.”You wondered then if the show would ever get round to revealing if the plank gene had entered her family tree through the maternal or paternal line.Then Michelle Skyped her mum and, waving a frothy cup of coffee at the screen, said: “Guess where I am. I’ll give you a clue, I’m drinking a cappuccino . . . ”“France?”Mystery solved.Loose Women, Russell Brand, with Janet Street-Porter: “Everyone is so beautiful here.”Good Morning Britain, roly-poly Piers Morgan: “When I grew up, I loved Frosties and it never did me any harm.”And Love Island, Samira: “I can sing, I can dance, I can act.” (Bursts into song).She can’t sing.NEVER, in all its ten-series history, has ITV’s love lift been quite as badly needed as it was on Saturday’s brilliant, one-off Take Me Out special for the “over-50s”.A slightly generous description, I thought, given the 30 game old birds looked like they had the combined age of the Pyramids.The fire still burns down below, though, evidently, as a queue of lights remained on for George, the midget Zumba teacher with the wooden teeth, Lawrence, the Billy Connolly lookalike from Ibiza, and even “bouncing Bill”, the ex-policeman, above, who emerged from Paddy McGuinness’s love lift gasping for breath and telling the women: “Every night, when I go to sleep, I like to think I’ve made someone’s life better. What would your motto be?”Fingers crossed, I’d imagine.Lee Dixon: “I like Alexander-Arnold because he gives you half a goal.”Ian Wright: “Harry Kane is still getting back to where he is.”And Glenn Hoddle: “By the time the World Cup starts, today will be history.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In 1883 which luxury train service ran between Paris and the city now called Istanbul?” Alice: “The Eurostar.”Ben Shephard: “The former Labour MP Ed Balls married which politician in 1998?” Phil: “Theresa May.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The plumage of what flightless bird was used as a medieval helmet decoration?” Geoff: “Eagle.”And Ben Shepherd: “How many of the eight planets in our solar system have the letter A in their name?”Harj: “I think the answer to that is one.

If youre looking for a watchdog, this is not the breed for you.A Malamutes size might scare off an intruder, but thats about the only protection youll get from them.They do best in situations in which they have plenty of room and opportunities to exercise so they dont become bored and restless.The twins will give you years of enjoyment as active playmates and companions who keep their puppy energy well into adult life. 2. Settling inJust like us, dogs can get scared or worried sometimes, especially in an unfamiliar new environment.If they had a favourite toy or blanket at the RSPCA centre, put that in there so they have at least one thing that smells familiar.Establishing a routine is key. Walks, feeding and bedtimes should be around the same time each day so they will know what to expect and build a trusting relationship with you.Take your time. Going from an RSPCA kennel to a new home can be overwhelming so just be patient, let them settle into the new home first and get to know you and the immediate family. Then gradually introduce them to new people and environments.3. Keep them happy and healthyDogs are intelligent and inquisitive so along with lots of exercise they’ll need toys and training activities to keep them entertained.They communicate through body language so owners need to learn to recognise what their signals mean so you can protect them from things that make them anxious or sad. Follow these tips and youll enjoy life with your new rescue dog and know that you’re giving a dog that may never have had a happy home a second chance at a happy life.Name: LillyLilly was taken into RSPCA care after her owner was made homeless and could no longer look after her.Like a lot of dogs who find themselves at the RSPCA, she has struggled to adapt to kennel life and is missing life as a beloved pet.Staff are keen to get her into a home as quickly as possible.She spends lots of time out walking with volunteers and absolutely adores people. Lilly thoroughly enjoys her walks and loves to investigate everything she is currently walked on harness and Gencon as she can be strong on lead so would suit a strong, active owner.She’s eager to please and will do anything for a stroke and a tummy tickle.She can be unsure of other dogs but enjoys walking with those she is familiar with. That said, she would be better suited to a single-dog household where she can have all the attentionShe has a lovely, gentle nature but can get very excited so would be best in a family home with older children from around age 12.The staff caring for her say she is a gorgeous girl with so much potential and will make a superb addition to a family.More info about LillyName: ChicoChico is a regal gent looking for his queen to guide him into his new life. Sadly, he came into care with a broken leg which has now fully healed.His previous history means he also prefers women to men but has formed good relationships with both.He has a gentle disposition and forms strong bonds with people.While hes only two years old, as a very young pup, he was not given the opportunity to experience the life and social skills he needed so he can sometimes become worried when he encounters busy or new experiences.His new owner will need to be prepared to spend time introducing him to new things and encourage him to not see them as a threat.Salukis are generally gentle and curious dogs and this brown and fawn pooch is just the same, with so much love to give.More info about Chico There will be an adoption fee to pay that goes towards helping the RSPCA continue rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming more dogs.These fees vary by centre from around £135 for adult dogs to £200 for puppies under six months.All RSPCA dogs are spayed, vaccinated and microchipped. And they come with free MORE TH\u0026gtN pet insurance for the first six weeks.Name: DaisyHomeless for: 5 months Daisy arrived at the RSPCA when she became extremely unsettled and unhappy after a family member moved out of the home.Daisy is an affectionate and friendly girl once she gets to know you but can be a little worried when meeting new people.She’d like a quiet, adult-only home where her new owners can continue to help her build in confidence.She’s very food orientated and absolutely loves her treats, which makes training much easier.However, her favourite thing of all is playing in a ball pit.The English bulldog has a sweet, gentle disposition and only needs 20 to 4o minutes of exercise a day.The breed usually have laid back temperaments, which makes them excellent companions, even in smaller households.More info about DaisyName: BenjaminMore info about BenjaminOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

although today they are among the estimated 500 British species which have become extinct in the past few thousand years.Here are 10 of the most surprising animals that once swam in our seas and roamed the landscape...The coypu - a giant rat-like creature weighing around 6kg - was first brought over to Britain from South America in 1929 and farmed for its fur.When many escaped from captivity at these farms, they took to the rivers and streams in Sussex, Hampshire, Norfolk and Devon.This was the perfect home for the semi-aquatic beasts and it wasnt long before they began breeding in the wild.But their grazing caused damage to habitats for local birds and plants, and well as to local agriculture, so it was decided that they needed to be culled and eradication was complete by 1989.The now extinct Great auk, a large bird resembling a penguin, lived across Great Britain up until 1844.As they couldnt fly and moved very slowly, they were hunted for their meat - a delicacy - and their feathers, used to make pillows.A Parliamentary Act that banned the killing of Great Auks for feathers was implemented as a last resort to save them in 1794 - but it was too late.Following their extinction, their skins and bones became expensive and sought after items.The UK holds the Guinness World Record for the largest number of specimens in the world - 15.This stunning butterfly, with a wingspan of up to three inches, was once commonly-seen in the woods of Southern England and Wales.However, in 1951 there were only 150 recorded large tortoiseshell sightings.Their demise has been put down to Dutch Elm disease -  a fungal infection spread by dark beetles - which killed off the insects main food source leaving only 1000 Elm trees growing in the UK to this day.The large tortoiseshell butterfly is still found in most of Europe, Northern Africa and Western Asia.One of the larger beasts thats hard to picture roving around the woods is the brown bear, which lived in UK forests in ancient and early Medieval times.They died out circa 1000AD after being over-hunted for their fur, but there have been recent suggestions to reintroduce them as they rarely attack humans - despite growing to 8ft tall.At present, they still roam free in Russia, Georgia and Armenia.A brown bear sanctuary is scheduled to open next year near Bristol - but unlike the bears from Medieval times, this family will be fenced in.Although a rumoured 100 remain in the Scottish Highlands, this once popular species died out in the rest of the UK in the 19th century.These creatures look very similar to tabby cats but have a larger and stockier build, and were often shot for their fur and by game hunters for fun, leading to their extinction.Sightings are very rare and conservationists say theyre often run-over and are still shot for fun by hunters.The magnificent mammoths - of which the closest living relatives are elephants - lived in the UK during prehistoric times but died out around 10,000 BC after the Ice Age.In 1986 woolly mammoth bones were discovered in a Shropshire gravel pit - and scientists believe they populated most areas of the UK.Red-backed Shrike migrated to Britain every year from Sub-Saharan Africa until 1945, when egg-collecting and destruction of their natural habitat wiped them out.By 1988 the red-backed shrike had only been seen in Breckland, a conservation area spanning Norfolk and Suffolk.A year later, they were declared extinct as there were no breeding pairs left.Many environmentalists are worried about the impact a declining bee population can have on the world -

Without that ultimate weapon we are certain to get a poor deal.The Prime Minister cannot accept what a small handful of Remainers determined to stop Brexit are demanding.As she has rightly said, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.The people said leave, not leave when the EU gives us permission.The EU Withdrawal Bill, which MPs voted on this week, is about ensuring legal certainty at our point of departure.Jeremy Corbyn voted against the Government on this key bill, cynically trying to frustrate the Brexit process for his own political ends.If Conservatives do not demonstrate discipline in support of Theresa May on this, then we risk letting him into power.The Government has already said the EU Withdrawal Bill can be framed so as to give Parliament a vote on the final outcome, but without blocking the UK’s departure even without a deal.The Bill will go back to the House of Lords on Monday, and is likely then to return to the House of Commons.We need to get this out of the way, because it is 14 months on from triggering Article 50 and we still have not discussed the vital trade relationship between the UK and the EU.This is because the EU Commission deliberately set out to ensnare the UK in a tortuous bureaucratic process designed to leave us in the weakest position, bound to the EU as some sort of vassal state — as a rule-taker.In this, the EU has been emboldened by the appalling behaviour of the unelected House of Lords, which made it clear they want to reverse the result of the referendum. One peer even spoke arrogantly of now bringing the British people to heel.You only need to have watched as the EU’s negotiators have gratuitously and remorselessly set out not just to be difficult but, it has become clear, to humiliate us.For example, their refusal to agree to our continuing involvement in the Galileo satellite project, despite the fact that we have invested heavily in it, demonstrates how their behaviour has been calculated to offend.Even the UK’s offer of defence intelligence co-operation, which the EU needs, was brushed aside.That the EU is now strutting like the school bully should not surprise us, because of its ideological commitment to the European project at all costs.Yet, for all their bluster, this masks a weakness.The EU is deeply worried the UK will leave the EU and become a serious trade competitor, thus not only damaging the EU’s trading position but encouraging those in the EU who oppose this centralised, protectionist behemoth.We have reached a critical moment in the Brexit process. Because of the EU’s inflexibility, the Government has been forced to make concessions in the hope of discussing that all-important trade relationship.This has left many of us concerned that the process has been too one-sided.The UK has been behaving as a friend who wants an amicable divorce, while the EU has behaved like an opponent who wishes to impose their will and force the UK to repent what they believe is the folly of Brexit.That is why the UK needs now to change its negotiating stance, once the Brexit bill is passed.Too often it seems as though it is the UK which negotiates as a supplicant — despite the reality that, as the EU’s largest trade partner and the fifth largest economy in the world, with the world’s fourth most potent defence forces, the UK is deserving of much more respect from the EU.After all, there is a great deal at stake for the EU if these negotiations go wrong.There are many among the EU 27 who, like us, are growing weary of the EU’s arrogance. After all, it is many of them who stand to lose jobs if we fail to reach a trade arrangement.The EU Council meeting later this month has now become critical. It is there we should say that, notwithstanding any ongoing issues concerning the Irish border, our requirement is we move now to negotiate our post-Brexit trade relationship.If they refuse, and want instead to continue their border demands, then we must have the resolve to leave the table.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So far all I’ve come up with is Iggle Piggle, from TV’s In The Night Garden.I think negotiating Brexit would be a stretch for the friendly blue woollen creature with the red Mohawk.But maybe I’ve got him wrong, underestimated his abilities. He has a bell in his left foot. Theresa May seems to have a brain in her left foot. Given the choice, maybe I’d take the kid with the bell.We are in chaos. Not because we voted for Brexit, far from it. The economy is doing well. The sky has not fallen in. Investment up, employment hitting record levels, inflation down.No, the problem is solely a consequence of our Government. Right now we don’t know exactly what deals have been done with the rump of Remainers within the Conservative Party.One moment we’re told the Prime Minister has caved in to their demands. Next minute she hasn’t. Nobody knows quite what to believe.She is tip-toeing between the two sides solely to stay in power. And she has to be told: It isn’t working. It sends out a message to the people we are negotiating with that we haven’t a clue what’s going on.That policy is formulated on the hoof. In fact, it’s not policy at all, just inept fire-fighting. Inept because the flames are spreading — and as a result, our negotiating position becomes weaker by the hour.Some will argue May can only play the cards she has been dealt. That she has a minority Government and a split in her own party.Well, sure. But then, to a considerable degree, she dealt the cards herself. She called an election a year ago expecting to get a huge majority.I could have told her she would lose, if she’d asked. But she didn’t ask me, she asked some other numbnuts instead. This holy mess is of her making.Britain voted to leave the EU. Not to stay in bits of it. Not to remain constrained by the EU’s regulations. The Remainers don’t like that?Don’t care. You lost the argument — so shut up for a while. Or work to get us the best deal we can, outside the customs union.We need to be clear to the EU negotiators that we will happily take a no deal Brexit. They don’t want that — and a tough line will make them respond. If it doesn’t — fine, no deal is still much better than a bad deal.The EU is falling apart, largely for the reasons that convinced us to leave. Bullying, dictatorial, corrupt, undemocratic.We need a leader who can exploit their manifest weaknesses. A lot — perhaps a majority — of European people are on our side.That leader isn’t Theresa May. It needs to be someone within the Tories who is A. a Leave voter and B. has a bit of charisma and nous.I don’t really care who, right now, David Davis, Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Michael Gove. But ABM — Anyone But May.It is not the EU that is hampering our exit strategy. It is our own Govern­ment. It’s time for Theresa to say: “That’s it: I’m out.”Now, quiz fans, here’s a question for you. What do Terry and Andraya possess that may have helped them come first and second?Jet-powered roller skates? Performance- enhancing drugs? Nope.They were both born with male bodies. And they both competed as boys until very recently.But according to the growing trend, they are now able to identify as girls without question. And so are allowed to compete against girls.And that’s what happens. They win because of biology.SHOULD the Royal Family be allowed to get their baps out? An important constitutional point.Meghan turned up for a royal engagement with her shoulders uncovered. And many people thought this was “inappropriate”. Only a matter of time before the female royals start trying to outdo each other.Kate in a glittery boob tube and Princess Anne in a leather basque with split-crotch undies.Bring it on.THE brilliant writer Lionel Shriver has been sacked as judge of a short story competition.This is because she objected to publishers having quotas that are supposed to “reflect diversity”.She said: “If an agent submits a manuscript written by a gay, ­trans- gender Caribbean who dropped out of school at seven and powers around town on a mobility scooter, it will be published.Whether or not . . . it is an incoherent, tedious, meandering and insensible pile of mixed- paper recycling.”The magazine that runs the competition sacked her for this.It said her comments were “not consistent” with its ethos.What it means is it disagrees with her.Freedom of speech, huh. Well done, Shriver.IN Cretins Corner this week are the libtards criticising President Trump for his attempts to make peace with North Korea.Six months ago these same people were screaming that Trump was leading us all to death and destruction by threatening Kim Jong-un.Now he’s accused of cosying up to a horrible dictator.Truth is, he’s played it brilliantly. Acting tough brought the porky dog-muncher to the negotiating table.And now we have at least a chance of peace in the world’s second most dangerous area (after the Middle East, natch).Barack Obama was bunged a Nobel Peace Prize for, essentially, doing nothing, by the liberals who run the awards.How about one for The Donald for actually achieving something?IS Sadiq Khan going mad?The Mayor of London has demanded that Wikipedia must “close the gender gap” on its entries. Just 17 per cent of biographies on Wiki are about women, apparently.What’s it got to do with you, you bumptious midget?As someone cleverly tweeted, just zero per cent of Imams at Britain’s mosques are female – perhaps they should close the gender gap a little too.Listen Sadiq, just build a few more homes in the capital and stop young ethnic minority people macheteing or machine gunning each other to death.When you’ve sorted that out, mate, then maybe you can start worrying about American online publications.Listen, mate. That’s our money you’re spending. He could have done that trip for sixty quid on the train.And we’d have thrown in a fiver for a packet of cashews and some Red Bull.APPARENTLY, young people are getting thicker.Their average IQ is declining year on year.If you follow the graph to its natural conclusion, by about 2028 they will have an IQ of zero.They’ll be like the Viz character Jellyhead, who had lime jelly between her ears and just lay on the floor all day.They’re already about the level of another Viz character, Terry F***witt.

So people will stand firm on this”.Tory Brexiteers hit back at the rebels to accuse them of a power grab and trying to rewrite Britain’s constitution.The boss of the hardline European Reform Group Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Sun: “If they want to mandate the PM to change her position they have to have a vote of confidence and get a new PM.“And that is the long established constitutional position.“I am keen for scrutiny but you need to observe the separation of powers between the executive and legislature.”Energy Minister Claire Perry tried to reassure the Tory rebels to insist Mrs May will not let them down.The minister said: “The Prime Minister is a woman who keeps her word”.As the EU looked on yesterday at the high stakes Commons drama, some of its leaders admitted they were struggling to keep up with its twists and turns.Dutch PM Mark Rutte confessed: “Of course, I’m a keen observer of what happens in London, so yes I’m following the votes.“I try to make sense of it, it’s not always easy.”Tory former minister Anna Soubry said she would also be voting for the EEA amendment.She told the Commons: “I will be voting for the EEA amendment because I believe, as I have said many, many times in this place, of the value of the single market.”Ms Soubry urged MPs to advocate the case for immigration and “suck it up”, saying: “Suck it up: there is no alternative that has been advanced in this place other than the customs union, the single market.“Let’s grab it, let’s do it and move on.”Last night local Tory association chiefs warned of repercussions if MPs defied Theresa May over the Brexit bill.One official in Jonathan Djanogly’s Huntingdon constituency — which voted 53.4 per cent to leave — said their members were torn over his Remainer stance.They described the situation as a “nightmare” saying there had been numerous calls for his deselection while he was branded a “liar” by angry party activists.However, the official said the constituency was split with many members and officials supportive of him after he increased his majority at last year’s General Election.In Heidi Allen’s South Cambridgeshire constituency — which voted 38.4 per cent to Leave — another party official said she was “assured” the MP had done what she “considered to be right” and there was unlikely to be consequences. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It wasnt meant that she was to die.He added that he deserved to die for what he had done, but a month before the confession both Trail and Boswell posted a video online denying their involvement.Trail and Boswell were quickly named as people of interest in the case and were arrested in late November in Branson, Missouri, on unrelated fraud charges.They have been held in the Saline County jail since then, though the charges in Loofes death werent announced until Monday.Authorities havent suggested a motive for the killing.The Nebraska Attorney Generals office, which is prosecuting the case, said it is considering seeking the death penalty."},{"url":null,"title":"woman head stuck exhaust pipe minnesota music festival","story":"Firefighters used a power saw to cut the tailpipe from the maroon-coloured vehicle and free the woman unharmed.The strange predicament happened at last weekends Winstock Music Festival in Winsted, near Minneapolis.Her rescue was filmed and uploaded to Facebook by a user called Billy Little, who wrote: How much alcohol does it take to get your head stuck in a diesel pickups exhaust tip?His post has already been shared more than two million times, much to everyone elses bemusement.She was identified by her local paper as 19-year-old Kaitlyn Strom, according to Mercury News.Kaitlyn told the Litchfield Independent Review: “We were just all having fun and I saw this big exhaust pipe and I was like, ‘Hey, my head could probably fit in that.’ So I tried it.”She claims she was stuck there for about 45 minutes before being cut free by fire crews.The woman apparently later posted a picture of herself posing next to the truck and the owner Tom Wold on Facebook.Smiling with her thumbs up, she wrote: Yeah Im the tail pipe girl, whatchu know about it? #winstock2k.The McLeod County Sheriffs Office says she was cited for underage drinking and escorted out."},{"url":null,"title":"takeaway driver removes christian cross front door southgate","story":"Georgia Savva, 48, a finance worker from north London, has reported the vandalism as an anti-religious hate crime.Georgia, who is Greek Orthodox, noticed the cross that had been on display by her front door for years had been ripped down and left scattered on her doormat when she left for work on Tuesday.Puzzled as to how it had ended up there, she asked her two teenage children to check the CCTV at their house to see what had happened.They were shocked when they watched it and saw the delivery driver grabbing the cross from the wall and ripping it in half before throwing it to the ground.Just seconds later the video showed the door opening and Georgia’s son handing the driver cash for the takeaway, including a tip.Georgia said she was devastated by what had happened.She said she’d been visiting the Romna Gate Tandoori in Southgate since she was a teenager, spending thousands of pounds and always tipping staff.The furious 48-year-old said: “I saw the broken cross on Tuesday and mentioned it to the children, who are at home revising for exams.“They told me to go to work and they would check the camera at the front of the house.“I assumed it would be a fox or something as the cross had been there for years, but they called me and said it was the delivery driver.“I called the restaurant and they ignored me and then I was so furious I went in there after work.“If you kicked over my plant pots I’d think you were a bit of a k**b, but what he did was really offensive.“It doesn’t matter what your personal view is, you do not treat people like that.

It was that feeling like when you are at the top of a roller coaster and youve just gone over the edge of the peak.It was an absolute sense of losing your stomach and that we were nosediving.The lady sitting next to me and I screamed and held hands and just waited but thought with absolute certainty that we were going to crash.Thankfully the pilot managed to regain control of the aircraft and nobody on the 484-seater aircraft was injured, news.au reported.QF94 took off from LA at 11.29pm, just two minutes behind QF12 which was headed for Sydney.It is thought the second place got caught in the first ones wingtip vortex, a circular pattern of rotating air the wings leave in their wake.These linger in the atmosphere long after the plane has moved on and can be a potential hazard to following jets, particularly light aircraft.The intensity of the vortex depends on size, speed and flap settings but unsurprisingly, the strongest ones are produced by heavier aircraft.A Qantas spokeswoman is reported to have said the two A380s were a safe distance apart: 20 nautical miles and 1000ft in ­altitude.There have been several incidents of wake vortexes causing serious injuries and even deaths after pilots lost control of the aircraft.In 1993, everyone on a domestic flight in the US died because plane was trailing a Boeing 757 too closely.More recently, an Air Canada Airbus A319 travelling over the north western United States encountered unexpected vortex turbulence from a Boeing 747 in 2008.The plane suddenly plunged 426m, sending cabin service carts flying wildly around the plane, seriously injuring several passengers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which is normally all about the bride - Meghan would have had to stop eating when the Queen did.The Queen is said to rigidly follow the tradition to the letter, but other members of her family - like Prince Charles -

The only tips we actually get are cash.I have just left this company as 70% of the card tips and 10% service charges go directly to the owners and are used to pay the salaried staff their wages.At the end of every night Albert’s take a percentage of our sales off us. Whether we have actually made the tips or not, they take a cut of everything we have sold from us that day. So theoretically we could end up paying out of our own pocket.“Then every fortnight we get a cheque showing us how much money we have made on card tips and then it shows the massive reduction that goes to ‘Albert’s house’ and the disheartening figure that we are actually coming away with.Payslips shared in the post show one example of £517.19 of tips earned in the financial year but £378.48 deducted to House Didsbury and another £75.70 to Kitchen Tip.Another employee, who wished to remain anonymous, provided a slip showing £138.30 of tips and deductions of £334.92 to House Didsbury and Kitchen Tip - resulting in take-home pay of £6.75 from £343.27 of earnings.James Ramsbottom, owner of Elle R Leisure who are behind Albert’s said today: “I cannot comment on specific allegations as that is now a legal matter.“However more than 90% of tips earned, go to staff on site.“Very occasionally, staff have been asked to contribute towards mistakes made but this has only amounted, in total, to £170 in the last 12 months. Again this system is in place to ensure good service.“If a server makes persistent errors, it can massively affect service, not just to the table in question, but the whole restaurant. However this is very rarely used and is at the discretion of the manager.”Tips are given voluntarily by customers to staff as a reward for the service theyve received.These tips can be kept by the employee, although technically they should be declared for income tax.If cash tips are placed into a central collection and distributed equally among staff, this should not be done by the employer.However, tips included in card payments are handled by the restaurant and can be pooled together and shared out among staff.Service charges are compulsory additions to a restaurant bill, typically for serving a large group, which are paid directly to the venue.With card payments and service charges there is no legal obligation for the restaurant to allocate a proportion of the service charge to employees. In August 2015, Elle R Leisure admitted that staff at Albert’s did not get all of their tips.The company said that some larger parties have a 10 per cent service charge added to the bill and part of that is kept by the company.They claimed this is used to pay for ‘staff welfare items’ - such as nights out, food and drinks and training for employees.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The kitchen is nicer than you would find in a lot of houses and its been finished to a really high standard.The estate agent continued: Its immaculate inside. You have got a big mezzanine floor with plenty of space for sleeping upstairs.It has a speaker system wired into the hut and its connected to the solar panels so you can keep track of your battery level and the intake of the solar panels.Theres LED lighting, a water heater, which is quite unusual to have in these huts, and it is one of the only ones I know that has a toilet, which is very handy in the middle of the night.Its all quite fancy and done very nicely. Its got everything you could want or need really.They continued: This one is on the harbour side, so youve got really nice harbour views and you get lovely sunsets there. Youve also got the added benefit you can have boats and kayaks in front of you and can launch straight onto the water from there.The huts at Mudeford are completely unique, theres nothing else like it I have seen anywhere in the country.

She said both royals wish her a happy birthday.As they went from one part of the county to another, there appeared to be some confusion over which car door Meghan should use, and whether the Queen should get into the car first or second.The royal pair then went on to Chester, 20 miles away, for further engagements. They attended the official opening of Storyhouse, a library, cinema and theatre complex, where they had a tour of the building.They met a Syrian settlement group engaged in craft work, and watched a performance by Fallen Angels, a dance theatre company for people who are recovering from addiction.In the theatre, they saw a medley of songs from Storyhouse\u0027s latest production, A Little Night Music. After their tour, they greeted the hundreds who had packed the streets outside, as they walked to the City Council, meeting with flag-waving royal fans, some of which went for an American flag in a nod to Meghan\u0027s heritage.She and the Queen spoke to several people during their walkabout and Meghan was spotted showing her wedding ring to one group.They collected dozens of floral bouquets and gifts.She told one person that Harry was the \"best husband\" and said married life was \"wonderful\". In her second balcony moment with the Queen, Meghan appeared on the Chester Town Hall terrace, alongside Lord Mayor of Chester, Councillor Alex Black, to deafening cheers from the crowds below.The Queen and Meghan had lunch at Chester Town Hall, as guests of the City Council, concluding their visit.Meghan married Prince Harry in Windsor in May and since then, has joined the royal family for Trooping the Colour, also known as the Queen\u0027s birthday parade, and has announced her first royal tour.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are to make an official visit to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and the Kingdom of Tonga in the autumn."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-rupert-everett-the-happy-prince_4336205.jpg?20180614163505 ","title":"rupert everett compares new film the happy prince to a long and agonising birth","story":"\"It was like a long labour\u0026#8230 agonising at times.\"It was always a question of taking one step forward and then two steps backwards, and it was demoralising, apart from the moments it went well.\"The actor, who became a household name after starring in My Best Friend\u0027s Wedding with Julia Roberts in 1997, said when he first wrote the script he had no idea how long it would take to go into production.After initially receiving a swift offer, Everett later refused the deal when it became clear one Hollywood producer wanted Philip Seymour Hoffman to play the role of Oscar Wilde instead of him.\"When I finished writing it Robert Fox, my producer, sent it to the greatest producer in America who\u0027s a guy called Scott Rudin, who really makes the best films in the states.\"He rang back the next day and said \u0027I love this film\u0027 and I was literally at that point making acceptance speeches in the mirror.\"But it was not to be so straightforward. \"The day after that -

The court heard that Louisa Jensen, 27, reportedly bit through the bone of the index finger on the left hand of the alleged victim Laura Gwin, 30, leaving her covered in blood.  The Liverpool Echo reports that Miss Gwin told the jury she lost almost the entire fingernail portion of the finger which was never recovered. After the alleged incident, which took place on 11th October last year, Miss Gwin told the jury she was forced to undergo surgery where the skin was pulled over the bloody stump to seal the wound. She told the court she is still unable to fully bend it. Jensen, of Tower Hill, Kirkby, admitted to Liverpool Crown Court that she banged on the front door of Miss Gwin but pleaded not guilty to unlawful wounding without intent. She denied biting her fingertip off and claims Miss Gwin attacked her first.  Kevin Slack, prosecuting, told the court the women had fallen out over rent that Miss Gwin owed to Jensen\u0027s aunt. It is claimed both women also made comments about each other to parents at their children\u0027s school. The jury heard that Miss Gwin was angry Jensen had been informed about the rent owed to her aunt. It is claimed she sent a message to the accused\u0027s aunt warning her she would rip Jensen\u0027s head off if she continued to contact her. On the day of the incident, the court heard that Jensen sent Miss Gwin angry Facebook messages telling her if she did not answer her phone “I will come to your door.” It is claimed Laura Gwin then sent a very angry message back to Jensen in which she used very unpleasant language.  Mr Slack said: “While the prosecution readily concede that the language used was unpleasant and unfortunate, the prosecution say that did not remotely justify what happened next.” Mr Slack said following the message, in which Miss Gwin called Jensen a “soft c****”, the complainant heard a loud bang on the front door. Miss Gwin, giving evidence, told the jury she answered the door to find Jensen stood in her front garden. Mr Slack asked: “When you opened the door, what if anything did she do?” Miss Gwin replied: “Lunged at me..she grabbed my hair and pulled me into the garden.” Mr Slack asked: “What if anything did you do?” The witness replied: “I fought back we were pulling each other\u0027s hair in the garden, stuff like that... “I had my hand in Louisa\u0027s face and she bit down on my finger... “At the time because we were fighting I didn\u0027t really feel the pain, it was only after.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit negotiations leave britain weak","story":"NewsBrexit negotiations leave Britain so weak it\u0027s like \u0027watching Jacob Rees-Mogg fight Anthony Joshua\u0027Labour\u0027s Carwyn Jones compared the talks between Britain and Brussels to a mismatched title fight - \"hot air versus tough reality\"\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor17:04, 14 JUN 2018NewsImagine Jacob Rees Mogg fighting Anthony Joshua.

Mocking the crunch negotiations, Labour grandee Carwyn Jones compared them to a fight between the posh Tory MP and the world heavyweight champion. And he rubbished mounting calls for a second referendum, claiming people would vote to Leave just “for the hell of it”. In a stinging attack on the state of the withdrawal talks, Mr Jones told the UK in a Changing Europe think tank: “It\u0027s been like watching Jacob Rees-Mogg square up to Anthony Joshua – hot air versus tough reality.  “Now there may be some interest in watching a Rees-Mogg versus Joshua bout, but there\u0027s no satisfaction for any of us in seeing the UK going through these Brexit humblings.”   He urged Theresa May to use a Government White Paper due to be published next month to switch her hard Brexit bid. Mr Jones called on the Prime Minister to “use this opportunity to come clean on Brexit, to erase the wobbly red lines and to get the country to a proper, Brexit-ready position”. Britain\u0027s ports, including in Wales, were unprepared for a hard EU withdrawal or crashing out of the bloc without a deal, he said in a speech at King\u0027s College London. “It\u0027s no good the Government blaming the ports for not spending money when this would be an outcome of the Government\u0027s making,” he said. “You can\u0027t switch the blame if that\u0027s what happens.” Mr Jones, who backed Remain in the 2016 vote, dealt a hammer blow to campaigners\u0027 calls for a second referendum.

Tom Watson said Unite general secretary Len McCluskey is now powerful enough to take me out as Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Number 2 man. The two men were once close friends - even sharing a flat together - but fell out amid Labour infighting and a no confidence vote in Mr Corbyn in 2016. Mr McCluskey is one of the Labour leader\u0027s most loyal backers, while Mr Watson was seen as turning against Mr Corbyn\u0027s leadership that summer. Members elected Mr Watson directly as Labour\u0027s deputy leader in 2015 and normally, he will hold on to the job until he stands down. But with enough political pressure, his critics could force a new contest if they win the backing of 20% of Labour MPs and MEPs. Speaking to the BBC\u0027s Nick Robinson for the Political Thinking podcast, Mr Watson insisted he will not be bullied.  Asked if he felt Mr McCluskey was coming for him, Mr Watson replied: Yes, he is coming for me. They\u0027re upping their delegates and all of that. What will be, will be. He\u0027s powerful enough, if he wants to take me out as deputy leader, he probably could, but that\u0027s up to him. I\u0027m just going to get on and try and bring everyone back together and do what I can as best I can. He added: It is very difficult that, because we were friends socially as well as understood each other politically. Sadly, we fell out over that week when Jeremy went into the second leadership election, and I\u0027ve not spoken to him since that week.   It is understood that Mr Watson came under pressure in the run-up to the 2016 leadership vote - when Owen Smith stood against Mr Corbyn - to denounce MPs who had backed a vote of no confidence in the Labour leader.

St Edmund Campion Catholic Primary School in Maidenhhead, Berkshire, has sent a desperate email to parents with a link to an Amazon ‘Wish List’ page, asking them to buy essential items. The 420-pupil school is struggling to balance its books and has turned to parents for urgent help. The Mirror revealed last year that rising numbers of head teachers were begging for cash from parents to offset Tory cuts - some asking for \u0026pound20 a month to buy basic teaching materials, such as textbooks. The school’s Wish List allows online shoppers using the retail giant to buy additional items when making purchases and send them to the school.  Among the 17 items on the list are toilet paper, which the school says “never ending supply required” and office and classroom supplies including pens, pencils, erasers and felt-tip pens. Parents are growing increasingly concerned and one says she was ‘shaken and nearly in tears’ after discovering the school is ‘begging for toilet paper’. Mrs May has represented the constituency of Maidenhead for 21 years. In March she told the House of Commons the Government was spending more on schools ‘than ever before’. One parent, Catherine del Campo, whose 10-year-old daughter attends the school, says she is worried about what the future holds for the school. She said: “I was shaken and nearly in tears, this is really desperate, the fact they are asking for office supplies and toilet paper. “As a parent, if the school is begging for toilet paper then it makes you wonder what’s next?” Ms del Campo says the new National Funding Formula, which was designed to iron out discrepancies in the way funding was applied to schools, is seriously underfunded if schools are begging for essential items.

Bike maintenance and accessories  Wheels Before setting off on a cycling trip, there are a number of things you need to check to keep things safe - starting with your wheels. If you haven\u0027t been out on the bike recently then the tyres may have deflated. To test them, inflate them, and check them after a few days. If they\u0027ve deflated, you might have a puncture. A tyre sealant, like Slime Bike Tyre Sealant , \u0026pound9.99, can help to prevent punctures. This liquid is pumped into the tyre to prevent future holes from causing a problem.  If you have a puncture, you\u0027ll need to remove the wheel to repair the puncture using Halfords Puncture Repair Kit, \u0026pound12. If you aren\u0027t sure where to start, Halfords offer a useful video guide to puncture repair. If you\u0027re planning a big family cycling trip then you\u0027ll also want to make sure you have a compact pump with you when you\u0027re out and about. Check out the Bikehut High Pressure Bike Pump (now \u0026pound15, save \u0026pound4). Chain  In the unlikely event that you suffer a broken chain, it\u0027s really worth having a repair kit with you, especially if you\u0027re mountain biking. Check out the Park Tool Mini Chain Brute Tool for just \u0026pound9.98, which is ideal if you need to repair a broken chain on the road. It\u0027s important to use chain oil or lubricant to keep the chain in good working order. The cheapest option is to use cycle oil - costing just \u0026pound4 - but you may choose to opt for a more expensive lubricant like Muc-Off , which is weather resistant. You should clean your chain before applying lubricant - there are special cleaners to help with this. Gears    The best way to keep your gears in check is with regular servicing, but if you do encounter a problem, it\u0027s best not to attempt to fix it yourself. Instead, get an in-store Halfords expert to help you get your gears working again. If your family does a lot of cycling, then taking out a Halfords Bike Care Plan is a worthwhile investment. These plans are a great way to leave the dirty work to someone else, as well as providing peace of mind that your bike is being looked after by Halfords\u0027 highly trained experts. Prices start from \u0026pound15 for kids\u0027 bikes and \u0026pound25 for adult bikes and include free fitting on parts and accessories bought from Halfords, as well as a free Silver Bike Service worth \u0026pound50. Brakes Every bike needs regular checks on its braking system, as you ride it\u0027s inevitable that cables stretch slightly and brake pads can wear down. It\u0027s another good reason to invest in a regular service at Halfords. But you can, and should, test them yourself as well to ensure they stop the wheels. Inspect the brake pads regularly to make sure they’re aligned with the rims.  Bolts    The last step for bike maintenance should be to check the bolts, like those on the wheels, are well tightened. There\u0027s no need to over-tighten, as this can cause problems too, but make sure nuts are all firmly secured. A spanner set or special bike tool will be needed, but the Halfords Basic 6 Piece Allen Key Set is just \u0026pound5.99 and should cover most bike nut sizes.  Lights   Make sure there are good lights attached to your bikes in case your cycle ride goes on later than planned! Halfords has a Silicone Light Set for just \u0026pound15 that attaches to pretty much any bike in seconds. If you\u0027re off on a cycling trip, the last thing you\u0027ll want to be doing is carting batteries around, so consider investing in a Rechargeable Bike Light Set, \u0026pound25. They recharge by USB, and feature high, low, and flashing modes. For little cyclists there are also a brightly-coloured Silicone Bike Light available for \u0026pound4 in blue, green and pink for all tastes. Cycling clothing   Like any sport, cycling involves wearing the right kit - both to keep you visible to other road users, and to keep you safe in the event of an accident. A well fitting helmet can seriously reduce the risk of a head injury, so you should get your kids in the habit of wearing one whenever they are out on their bikes. Halfords stock a range of fun designs like Paw Patrol and Disney Princesses , with prices starting at \u0026pound10, while older kids might like the Purple Swirls Kids Bike Helmet which looks cool and offers excellent protection. But the best way to encourage your kids to wear a helmet is to lead by example by wearing one yourself. The HardnutZ Stealth Hi Vis MTB Helmet is a good choice at \u0026pound35 (down from \u0026pound55), and is available in four colours. One of its key advantages is that its highly reflective under street lamps and car headlights.  Being seen is crucial for any cyclist, young or old. Grab a family pack of Halfords Hi Vis Vests for just \u0026pound11.99 and the four vests (two adult-sized and two kid-sized) will make everyone much more visible on the roads. Vests are also available individually .

Prince Georg-Constantin of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, 41, died during a race with his friend Jean Christophe Iseux, Baron von Pfetten. He was visiting his pal at his \u0026pound2.5million home, Aethorpe Palace, when the accident occured. The palace is the same location where he proposed to his wife Olivia Rachelle Page. Emergency services were called to the scene after someone placed a 999 call at 8.30pm on Saturday.  Prince Georg was later pronounced dead. Alexander Fiske-Harrison, who was friends with both the late prince and French diplomat Jean Christophe, revealed the prince died in the grounds of the palace. He said: From what I have been told from friends is that Con (Prince Georg-Constantin) was visiting Jean Christophe and they went out for a hack (horse ride). Con was a brilliant jockey, he raced at Cheltenham and wherever he went he rode. On Saturday he and Jean Christophe went for a ride. He was wearing a helmet and was riding in the grounds.  It was soft and flat and, from what I understand, was with Jean Christophe when he fell. I don\u0027t know the exact details of what happened. I understand his wife was not there at the time. Prince Georg-Constantin was successor to the House of Wettin and his family have links to a number of royal houses across Europe. A spokesman for Northamptonshire Police said: Police were called to reports of a sudden death in East Northamptonshire at about 9.25pm on Saturday, June 9.

Steve Job has has criticised the council for not giving enough support to separated parents, having tried for years to move from his two-bed maisonette in Longhill, east Hull. The 51-year-old, who works as an auxiliary nurse at Castle Hill Hospital, has had to give the biggest bedroom in his house to his four kids, made up of two 13-year-old twins and two boys aged 12 and 10. The boys spend three nights a week with their dad at his home but, with the twins set to soon become teens, tensions are mounting between the youngsters, Hull Live reports. “It’s a nightmare to be honest and I’m thinking about giving up my bedroom, putting two of them in there and putting up a sofa bed downstairs so I can split the kids up, but then I will have no space, Steve said.  MUM\u0027S HOUSING HELL AS HER COUNCIL HOME IS SO SMALL HER DAUGHTER \u0027HAS TO SLEEP IN A CUPBOARD\u0027      “They are always arguing with each other because there is just no room in their bedroom. “The twins are the eldest and they are getting to stage where adolescence is setting in and they are going to get quite emotional with puberty hitting. “The kids always want to bring their mates round but they just can’t because I haven’t got the space and we don’t even have our own garden for a barbecue. “It sometimes makes me feel down and sometimes I go to work for a rest from the kids. It sounds bad but it is a bit of a sanctuary.” Mr Job says the children are registered with their mother, who also rents a house from Hull City Council, and therefore he is technically registered as a single man, which does not make him a priority when it comes to finding a new property. “When me and my ex split up I registered with the council and got offered this place which I took straight away because I knew it could be waiting months to get anywhere else, he said.  “The kids are registered with their mum and for me to get a house with enough room for the kids they would have to be registered through me. “But if they were, their mum would not have a house so it’s a catch 22. It seems like only one of us can win and I daresay there are thousands of others in my situation. “I’ve looked into privately renting but it’s just not something I can do because they are all out of my price range. “I can’t afford a mortgage either so staying with the council is the only way for me to go.” After five years of struggling to manage his finances and the lack of space within his house, Mr Job is desperate to find a resolution. He has called on Hull City Council to help him and other single parents so they can give their children the best home life possible. “The kids would really benefit from having three bedrooms,” Mr Job said. “I would just like some help and for someone to look at the situation I’m in because at the moment it seems like no one is bothered.

The Duchess of Sussex wed Prince Harry last month and is clearly loving married life as she told well wishers her other half is the best husband ever. Former Suits actress Meghan was on a walkabout when onlookers asked how she\u0027s been enjoying married life. She described being married as wonderful before adding: I\u0027m really enjoying it. He\u0027s the best husband ever. The Duchess of Sussex smiled and charmed as she joined the Queen today at a host of engagements across Cheshire.  The pair travelled overnight on the royal train, a privilege normally only afforded to Her Majesty, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Camilla. As the pair disembarked from the train, they were greeted by the Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire, David Briggs, who told the Duchess: “I understand it is your first trip to the north of England.” She replied: “That’s correct. I’m very happy to be here.” After leaving Runcorn, the pair were driven to nearby Widnes so the Queen could officially open the new \u0026pound1.86 billion Mersey Gateway bridge over the Mersey.  The Queen, in a green Stewart Parvin outfit and Rachel Trevor Morgan hat, and Meghan, who was wearing a Givenchy dress, chatted to Halton Council officials, architects and engineers and others involved in the 25-year project to create the new toll bridge across the Mersey between Widnes and Runcorn. “It’s a magnificent bridge,” Meghan, 36, told them before joining the Queen on a stage to watch a dance performance by local schoolchildren celebrating 1,000 years of crossings across the river. The royal visitors lapped it up, smiling and chatting to each other and to dignitaries as they watched children dance to a seven-minute medley of music that included Edgar’s March Pomp and Circumstance and The Beatles’ Can’t Buy Me Love. Next stop was a visit to the new Storyhouse cultural centre in Chester. Moments after the Queen’s burgundy Bentley pulled up to huge cheers from the thousands who has gathered to catch a glimpse of the royals, the city stood still for a minute’s silence on the one year anniversary of the Grenfell fire. Onlookers speculated whether Her Majesty had purposely worn green - the colour displayed in tribute to the 72 people who tragically lost their lives in the blaze.  After watching a group of children from Ashgrove Farm day nursery took part in an enthusiastic rendition of The Wheels On The Bus before meeting a group of Syrian refugees engaged in a craft project. Just moments before the Queen and Duchess left the theatre, the dark grey clouds that had threatened to bring rain and had loomed overhead for the most part of the morning suddenly parted to reveal glorious sunshine. Her Majesty took no hesitation in walking straight up to well wishers who had pinned the security barriers a flag with her face centred upon the Union Jack. Alison Franklin, 68, said: “The Queen smiled broadly at us and we thanked her for coming. She said she had enjoyed her visit very much.” Meghan, slightly hesitant before joining in, delayed her first interaction with the crowd until a royal aide gestured her forward. Amid huge cheers, she was greeted by the Linforth family who had travelled from Oxten overnight and stayed in a camper van nearby, emerging at 7am to get the perfect spot to greet the royals.  Mum Clare beamed as her son Ben, eight and daughter Charlotte, nine, shook hands with the Duchess and welcomed her to the city. The children, who had been granted the day off school by their head teacher, handed Meghan a bouquet of flowers as the Duchess said: “Thank you so much”. Royal fan Jo Richards from Chester handed the Duchess a gift book of sketches by her friend depicting local landmarks before asking her about married life. She said: “Meghan looked simply perfect, she is actually jaw droppingly gorgeous. “I thanked her for coming to Chester and she sweetly said ‘You’re welcome, I’m very happy to be here’. “Then I asked her was she enjoying married life and she said ‘Harry is the best husband’, she was so sweet.”  Buoyed by her friend’s confidence, Sharon Briscoe, 61, from nearby Chirk asked to see Meghan’s wedding ring before remarking on Meghan’s stunning look at her Windsor wedding. Mrs Briscoe, said: “I was actually stunned by how beautiful she is in the flesh. I asked her how married life was and she said ‘wonderful’, and then I told her how gorgeous she looked at her wedding and that both her and Harry look made for each other to which she replied ‘Thank you, that means so much to us both’. “It was an unforgettable experience, just wonderful.” A group of school friends from Stockport in Manchester took the first train to Chester this morning to get in place outside the town hall to catch a glimpse of the Queen and Meghan. Daisy Johnson, 20, excitedly called out to the Duchess as she came by, attempting to usher her over to meet her friend, also called Meghan. Daisy said: “I got quite excited as she was getting nearer and I just blurted it out really, I called over to her ‘Excuse me Meghan, do you want to meet my friend Meghan?  “She turned to us straight away and walked over, smiled and said ‘Hello Meghan, lovely to meet you’.” Meghan Perry, 20, said: “I couldn’t believe it, she actually came over and said hello, it was really lovely.” A group of teenage girls bunked off from school to see the Queen and Meghan and ended speaking to both of them. Maryam Khan, 15, said: “We skived off school for this. We have been standing here for six hours. But it was completely worth it. ”It has brought diversity to the royal family, it shows that it is a modern age. She is a role model, she is a humanitarian.

The former actress is being considered for an Emmy Award for her portrayal of Rachel Zane in the American television show Suits , making her the first British royal to be submitted for Emmy consideration. The news was confirmed by a network representative on Wednesday. If the submission is successful, Meghan would be nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actress category for her final season of the legal drama.  None of the Suits cast members have managed to earn a nomination for the show during its first six seasons. However her co-star Patrick J. Adams did scoop a SAG award nomination for his role as her onscreen husband, Mike Ross, back in 2012. Adams has also been submitted for an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, along with Gabriel Macht. Rick Hoffman, Sarah Rafferty and Gina Torres are also being considered for Emmy awards in relation to the show.  This would be a last hurrah for Meghan\u0027s acting career, after the Duchess officially retired from the screen at the end of 2017 to focus on her royal duties. I don\u0027t see it as giving anything up. I just see it as a change, said Markle. It\u0027s a new chapter, right? And also, keep in mind, I\u0027ve been working on [Suits] for seven years. We were very, very fortunate to have that sort of longevity on a series...I\u0027ve ticked this box, and I feel very proud of the work I\u0027ve done there, and now it\u0027s time to work with [Harry] as a team.  Markle had a seven-year run on Suits, making her last appearance in April. Her final episode featured a spectacular wedding between her character and Adams\u0027 - and it aired just one month before her lavish wedding to Prince Harry.

The Duchess of Sussex visited the Cheshire town for a day of engagements - including the opening of the Mersey Gateway Bridge and Storyhouse in Chester - without Prince Harry. The royal duo arrived at Runcorn Station by Royal Train before departing by car for the bridge, where they were introduced to architects, planners and community representatives. Local schoolchildren performed \u0027Bringing Communities Together: Halton\u0027s river crossings over the ages\u0027 before the Queen unveiled a plaque marking the opening.

Children from local schools lined up in the street before the Queen made her way through, followed by Meghan. The Queen and Duchess of Sussex then departed by car to travel to Mersey Gateway Bridge, which the monarch is officially opening.  Her Majesty’s outfit is by Stewart Parvin and has previously been worn in France D Day and Ireland state visits. The Queen\u0027s hat by Rachel Trevor Morgan, while the Duchess’s outfit is by Givenchy. Birthday girl Abigail Grimes, aged five today, a pupil at Beechwood Primary School in Runcorn, was chosen to present the duchess with a posy of flowers, the royal visitors nodding and thanking the youngster for her gift.  Meanwhile the Queen was given a posy by Jack Jackson, aged 10, from St Michael\u0027s Catholic Primary School in Widnes. By mid morning, the Queen and Duchess had arrived at the Catalyst museum in Widnes. Schoolchildren and dignitaries gathered in the grounds of the museum on Spike Island.  Grange Hill and Brookside creator Phil Redmond and wife Alexis, the High Sheriff of Cheshire, were among those gathered to greet the royals. Mr Redmond joked he should have asked Meghan if she wanted a part in his soap Hollyoaks. He said: I didn\u0027t ask her, but there\u0027s still lunch yet. She\u0027ll have to go through the audition process like everybody else.    Mrs Redmond said: It\u0027s fantastic to have them here and it\u0027s a big day for Cheshire.

Claire Senior, 40, tried to surprise her sun-loving children with a jumbo-sized paddling pool to cool off in - but was shocked with what she unwrapped. Upon opening the pool, which Claire believed to be a ‘normal’ paddling pool size, she was shocked to find the pool was just the size of her shoe. However, despite the panic of not having a pool for summer setting in, Claire found herself in hysterics over the toy – which fit into her bin with ease.  Luckily the personal trainer then found a pool for the children later that day, and ensured that she checked the dimensions on the box. Claire, from Leeds, said: “Our other pool at home had broken and I knew that the children would want to play in it in the garden over the summer. “So I went out on a search for a pool and one of the shops on my high-street had this pool in, so I grabbed it and thought nothing of it. “It said on the packaging that it was a paddling pool and it gave me the dimensions, but I honestly just didn’t think to look into it.  “I assumed it would be a ‘normal’ paddling pool size – until I opened the package. “It’s now in the bin and luckily I managed to find the kids another pool that wasn’t pocked sized!” Despite Claire thinking the pricing of the pool was too good to be true, she still didn’t suspect it would be so tiny. However now she claims her mistakes were obvious, and vows to always check the packaging in future. She said: “I think it only cost \u0026pound1 for the pool, so I should have known it was too good to be true and would be rubbish!

Terry Loong, 40, opted for what is known as postpartum confinement – a practice she says is common in Asian culture, where a new mother does not leave the house, have visitors or, in some cases, bathe for a month following delivery.  The thinking behind it is that it helps protect both mum and baby from infections, gives the mother a chance to recover and recharge, and allows the two uninterrupted bonding time.  Aesthetic doctor Terry admitted she did smell of bodily fluids but she said she didn\u0027t care. She believes it helped her bond with little Matthew, free of any distractions, while giving her body the rest it desperately needed.  Terry, who is of Malaysian heritage and lives in Harrow, north west London, said: “I remember my mum having a period of confinement when I was little. I’m the oldest of five so I saw it a lot. “It is common in Asian culture. Some of my Chinese friends here in London have done it too but adapted it to what works for them, picking different parts of it. “I don’t know many people that did it fully, like me. The biggest thing is that people couldn’t believe I hadn’t showered. It wasn’t pretty, but it was important. If I had another baby, I would definitely do it again.” Following a textbook pregnancy, Terry went into labour with Matthew, now two, at just 37 weeks. Her contractions started as she was on a Skype call to a patient. Coincidentally, she had been due to throw a baby shower days later – but as her son arrived early she ended up holding it eight weeks after the birth instead. She continued: “I remember calling my friend who had organised the shower and saying ‘I don’t think I can make it – I’m having the baby now.’ “I got an Uber taxi to hospital and was in absolute agony, screaming the whole way. “Within three hours of that first contraction, I’d had my baby.”  After giving birth to Matthew naturally at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, south west London in April 2016, Terry said she felt “like she’d been hit by a bus”.   But despite experiencing a first degree tear, her baby was a healthy lad. Keen to give herself a proper chance to heal, she decided to try postpartum confinement. She explained: “It takes an enormous amount of energy to make, carry and deliver a baby. “The sheer exhaustion I felt was a shock to my body. I knew I needed to rest, so decided to try confinement as I thought it would give me a chance to heal properly and mentally rest so I could be the best mother possible.” So a day after the birth, Terry, who is married to 37-year-old business consultant Kurt, headed home without showering. She added: After the birth I had blood down below and was covered in sweat. My hair was really greasy to start with and I did smell of bodily fluids, but I didn\u0027t care. It was the most natural thing in the world. Because she had sutures (stitches) in following the birth, Terry ensured she maintained a level of hygiene by washing her intimate areas with a witch hazel solution. She also sprinkled baking powder into her hair to absorb the grease as it got dirtier. But, for a month she didn’t properly wash her hair or shower. She said: “I almost got used to it by the end, but I could tell I was smelly. I was committed to completing it though. “By the end of it, Kurt joked ‘Thank god you’re allowed to shower now’. So much dead skin came away in that first shower – it was almost like I had cocooned myself. We did wash the baby though as we wanted to keep him clean. There was more to confinement than not washing however, and Terry adhered to strict rules covering physical exertion and staying indoors. For 30 days she read books and spent time with her baby, but did not even open her windows or venture into the garden.

A jury also heard how Ian Robertson\u0027s nine-year-old son was upstairs while he carried out the brutal attack on Robert Sempey. Robertson had used a voice recorder on his mobile phone to capture himself asking the fatally wounded 37-year-old “how are you still alive?” after the frenzied attack at his home in Beilby Road, Haydock. Mr Sempey\u0027s family cried in Liverpool Crown Court as they heard how twisted Robertson asked his victim: “Do you want to tell your kids you love them?”  The court heard how Robertson later texted his boss asking for help burying the body, the Liverpool Echo reports.  Robertson, 33, has been jailed for life with a minimum of 21 years in prison at Liverpool Crown Court today after admitting murder.  The court heard his partner Kirsty Jervis, 31, who also lived in Beilby Road, helped the killer clean up after the murder and failed to raise the alarm. She was locked up for two years and eight months after admitting assisting an offender. The court heard “old friends” Robertson and Mr Sempey met at a pub in St Helens before returning to Robertson\u0027s home to continue drinking on the evening of January 19 this year. Christopher Tehrani, QC, prosecuting, said the pair had argued during the night and that witnessed described Robertson as “bullying” Mr Sempey, who was described as polite and friendly. At one point Robertson stabbed Mr Sempey in the arm and punched him, but even then the pair calmed down and continued to socialise. However Robertson\u0027s son saw them fighting again that night, with Mr Sempey holding a knife to defend himself, before being told to go to bed by his father. Judge Andrew Menary, QC, passing sentence, told Robertson: “I am sure that Robert Sempey was not then intent on causing you harm so much as attempting to defend himself from the threat posed by you. “Given the terrible injuries suffered by him and the complete lack of injury suffered by you, you must have quickly overpowered him, retrieved the knife and used it to butcher this man. “What you did then beggars belief.  Having fatally wounded him, but while he was apparently conscious, you used your mobile phone to record his last dying minutes.” Judge Menary said the recording was “too shocking” to be played in court but ordered that whenever Robertson\u0027s sentence is reviewed, decades from now, it should be heard by a Parole Board. He said: “On it you can be heard clearly and calmly talking to Mr Sempey, asking him with feigned incredulity why he was still alive despite what you had done to him. “Mockingly, you ask him if he wants to tell his children that he loves them you tell him he\u0027s like the Terminator while you hum the tune to the movie and ask him if he wants you to stab him in the throat again or in the heart.” The court heard between four and six “thuds”on the audio recording, consistent with further knife wounds being inflicted on Mr Sempey\u0027s chest. A post-mortem exam revealed a horrendous category of injuries, including around 12 knife wounds to the throat, chest and abdomen. The court heard Robertson enlisted the help of Jervis, who had been sitting upstairs with the children. She cleaned the house while at some point Robertson dragged Mr Sempey\u0027s mutilated body into the garden, where it was partially covered by two old doors. Shockingly, the court heard how his son heard him asking Jervis for help with the body. The following day Mr Sempey was reported missing by his sister and police attended.

Kyle Yule was murdered after being spotted sat alone in a silver Renault Clio when it was surrounded by the five thugs who smashed the windows and slashed a tyre .  New video which can only be shown for the first time today shows how they chased him down a street - before stabbing him to death. Kyle ran from the car to a friend’s house but as he banged on the door was knifed five times by the gang who ignored his pleas for mercy. A court heard how he was heard pleading with gang leader and pharmaceutical science student Victor Maibvisira, 19, known as Vee: “Vee stop, I’ve had enough. I get the point.” One of the knife blows from Maibvisira pieced his right armpit and severed an artery.  The hooded and masked teenagers then fled on foot or bikes, leaving Kyle bleeding to death in the front garden. He died on the operating table The murder in Gillingham in Kent last October was a culmination of a feud when the gang accused one of Kyle\u0027s friends of stealing a bike. Just five days before the murder CCTV captured Maibvisira, Ephrain Akinwunmi-Streets, 17, and Shezakia Daley, 18, attempted to attack two men outside a pub with machetes, knives and a belt. All five admitted being there but denied stabbing Kyle. Maibvisira and Daleywere were the only two to give evidence, each blaming the other for inflicting the fatal blow. But after a trial at Maidstone Crown Court all five were convicted of murder and sentenced today.  Maibvisira was handed the longest minimum sentence of 24 years while Akinwunmi-Streets, Daley, Tyler Ralph, 17, and Jordan Dania, 16, were given a minimum of 16 years. Kyle\u0027s mother Nikki Yule wept as she read out a moving victim impact statement to the packed court the murder of her eldest child of four was savage She told the five teenagers: The night you took the life of my beautiful loved son has ruined my family\u0027s life forever. Ms Yule said Kyle was looking forward to his 18th birthday in November last year, but never got to celebrate it.  He said “His funeral was two days after his birthday. To those involved in taking his life, how dare you sit there and look forward to your birthday? “He will never get to see another birthday or Christmas again. He will never get married, never have children, never have a chance to see his brothers and sisters grow up. She branded the five “cowards running around with knives” and added: Nobody has the right to take somebody else’s life. That night I have been told my son was screaming, begging you to stop, and you just carried on.  “He would not hurt anyone. He was not in a gang. He would not start a fight. I know my baby was petrified. He never stood a chance. Sentencing Judge Adele Williams said: This case illustrates the problems which occur when young men such as you carry knives and use knives. “You all had a fascination with knives. I have no doubt you all thought it was glamorous and macho to carry a knife. “You, Ephrain Akinwunmi-Streets, said in interview you all sometimes wore masks to scare people. You all though it would make people look up to you and to fear you. “You were all running out of control at this time. You believed the law did not apply to you. During the trial, you all sought to blame each other. “This was a revenge attack upon another group. “It was a senseless, ruthless and calculated killing, for which not one of you has at any stage shown any sign of remorse.” Maibvisira, of Gillingham, Akinwunmi-Streets, from Sittingbourne, Ralph, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Daley, 18, of Gillingham, and Dania, from Croydon, south London, all denied murder and violent disorder but were found guilty last week.

The fire was still burning. Just as it was dying down to black, acrid smoke, the wind would reignite it. Sheets of burned-out cladding lay in the road. There was no birdsong. The street was alive with people carrying boxes and dragging trolleys of water and blankets as the volunteer-led relief effort unfolded. Walking twice round the police cordon told me there was no one in charge. No one. Just the shattered silhouettes of firefighters going in again and again or resting briefly on the grass, heads in blackened hands. And something else struck you. This was an extraordinary community. The churches, mosques, community centres, everyday people who’d been volunteering all night.  We knew we were looking at a mass grave. “This is mass-murder,” people said. “We died in there because we don’t count. That cladding was put on to make the poorest place in Kensington look nicer for its rich neighbours.” Everyone was talking about resident Ed Daffern’s prophetic blog, that foretold this. As Ed says: “Everything that happened could have been prevented.”  I met a woman asking for news of her sister who had been on the 21st floor. Later, I saw her screaming and knew she had found her answer. That day, children I didn’t yet know were being brought down alive. One was Naila El Guenuni, now 12, who was on the 18th floor and spent weeks in a coma.

Megan, the Duchess of Sussex, and the Queen appeared to be getting on famously as they attended their first Royal engagement together in Chester on Thursday. The duo were seen smiling and laughing as they opened the new Mersey Gateway Bridge, a month after Meghan officially joined the family when she tied the knot with Prince Harry. And new footage shows the Queen helping Meghan when the former Suits actress asked who goes first? as they were about to get into their car.  The video shows the duo holding flowers as they left the bridge opening but as they approached their car Meghan was clearly confused about who should get in first. She turned to the Queen and said: Who goes first? The Queen then instructed her to get in first and she then followed into the plush motor.

Jen Phanomrat, of the YouTube channel Just Eat Life, shared the happy news with her 81,000 subscribers when her boyfriend of nine years Leo Samanamud finally proposed. After getting engaged, Jen posted a photo of her and Leo on her Instagram account, writing: Nine years later, I said YES to my best friend! While some fans were quick to congratulate the happy couple, Jen said she was shocked by the number of negative comments criticising the size and style of Jen\u0027s ring.  It just seems like he went into the store like show me the smallest ring ever made,\u0027 one wrote. I understand simplicity, but this is beyond my understanding why anyone would buy something that small. Another mocked Jen by asking: Where\u0027s the ring? while another added: So are we all just going to pretend like that ring isn\u0027t microscopically small? Another even went as far as to suggest that Leo hadn\u0027t bothered to find out her ring size and suggested the ring wasn\u0027t big enough for Jen\u0027s finger. It must suck to wait nine years for a ring that looks like that, one wrote.  However Jen refused to let the nasty comments dampen her engagement joy and told Yahoo News the ring was exactly what she would have chosen for herself. He knew exactly what type of ring I\u0027d love, she said. A delicate, hammered gold ring with a tiny pearl. I don\u0027t usually wear any jewellery, but when I do, it\u0027s simple and minimal. Jen said she was shocked that so many people leaving the negative comments were other women. I was shocked to see so many females wasting their time replying to each other to dampen our happy moment, she said. She explained that she had deleted many of the hateful comments but has since seen a meme using their photo which was shared on Instagram with the caption: Ladies, would you accept the ring and say yes? However the couple also received lots of positive comments congratulating them on their engagement.

Emma Pichl and Alex Lovine, both in their 20s, were horrified when Mr Ahmad El Boutari pulled over and kicked them out of the car after they had a peck on the lips. The couple were travelling from Brooklyn to Manhattan, America, on Saturday afternoon when the incident occured. After witnessing their kiss, the driver told them you should not do that.  He then pulled over and was recorded telling them: You can\u0027t do this in the car. Mr El Boutari\u0027s licence was suspended on Tuesday and Uber has launched an investigation into the incident. The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission said his behaviour was ridiculous while Uber said they do not tolerate discrimination. “It’s 2018 in New York City, and this isn’t the way we live anymore,” said Allen Fromberg, spokesman for the commission. Ms Lovine shared the video, which has been viewed 45,000 times, on Facebook and wrote: Tough experience yesterday. Help spread the word about this Uberdriver.  The footage shows the driver saying: You can\u0027t do this in the car. One of the women hits back: Kissing is not illegal but the drivers insists it is saying you\u0027re not allowed to do this.

Charlton players Reeco Hackett-Fairchild and Karlan Ahearne-Grant, both 20, were led into court in handcuffs. Dressed casually the pair kept their heads down and said nothing as they were led from a police car to the courthouse in Ibiza town. The pair were arrested early on Tuesday after a 19-year-old holidaymaker’s parents took her to police to lodge a formal complaint. A third man, not believed to be a footballer, has also been arrested in connection with the incident, but did not appear in court with the footballers.  The alleged sex attack, described locally as a rape, is believed to have taken place at a hotel Cala de Bou near San Antonio after the 19-year-old tourist and a female friend met the footballers at a bar on Monday and agreed to go back to their hotel with them. Detectives have been told one of the men forced himself on the holidaymaker while the other held her down and a third filmed what was happening on a mobile phone. The men, who were on holiday in Ibiza alongside fellow professionals and friends, were due to be quizzed by an investigating magistrate.  The hearing, which could conclude with the magistrate deciding to dismiss the case against them but is more likely to end with remands in custody or a bail release pending an ongoing criminal investigation, will be held in private as is normal in the early stages of a Spanish judicial probe. The third man is aged 26 and also a British national, Spanish police confirmed on Thursday as the two footballers appeared in court. A Spanish National Police spokesman said: “National Police officers arrested two English men on Tuesday in San Jose in Ibiza as the suspected authors of a sex attack. “The parents of the 19-year-old victim, who is also British, reported the incident to police.  “It would appear the victim and a female friend of hers who were on holiday in Ibiza with the victim’s parents, went to San Antonio on Monday afternoon and met several lads from a second division football team in the UK in a bar there. “Both women agreed to go back with the some of the men to the hotel they were staying at, in the municipality of San Jose. “Once they were in a room, one of the youngsters was allegedly sexually attacked by one of the players, while a second took hold of her and a third recorded her on a mobile phone. “After the incident, the visibly affected victim and her friend left the hotel to go back to the woman’s parents.  “The victim’s parents quickly suspected something was wrong and after discovering what had happened, went to speak to the National Police. “National Police officers went to the hotel where those allegedly responsible for the sex attack were staying, and subsequently arrested two men. “The police investigations are ongoing and further arrests in the coming hours have not been ruled out.” A Charlton Athletic spokesperson said: The club have been made aware and are looking into this matter. Due to the ongoing investigation we will not be commenting any further at this stage. Cala de Bou, which is in the municipality of San Jose, is a popular location for tourists looking to stay somewhere quieter than San Antonio but within easy reach of the brash party resort.

And now pop star Gebby Vesta is calling on clubs to better protect performers and says the attacker should not have been allowed to get so close. In the disturbing clip the artist is performing in a nightclub in Central Java, Indonesia, when she crouched down on the walkway. The man leant toward her but as Gebby pushed his hand away and went to stand up, he leered even closer and touched her between her legs. The 32-year-old singer and DJ dealt out her own swift punishment - using her high heeled leather boots to kick the man in the head.  He was quickly removed from the club and Gebby used the incident which took place in December to warn people not to assault women just because they are on stage. She said: I kicked his face and my heart was still not satisfied. What he did was not appropriate. Wearing sexy clothes is part of the job I do.

The computerised footage shows bombs exploding in and around the Olympic stadium in Sochi as an ISIS drone soars overhead.  The terror group - which issues threats before major sporting events and holidays - claims it has jihadists in Russia who are planning to carry out attacks. The video, released by an ISIS-linked propaganda channel, is the latest in a series of threats by the terrorists, who have also put out a number of mocked-up posters vowing a massacre like never seen before.  Sochi\u0027s waterfront Fisht Olympic stadium, which hosted the 2014 Winter Games, holds almost 48,000 fans. It will host four group stage matches, including Portugal v Spain on Friday night, and Monday\u0027s showdown between Belgium and Panama, who are in Group G with England. It is the venue for one round of 16 match and one quarter-final clash.    This summer\u0027s World Cup - which begins Thursday afternoon - is being staged under a heavy police and military presence to prevent terror attacks, violence or disorder. Russian officials have assured players, fans and others involved in the event that they have taken unprecedented security measures and prepared for a number of possible scenarios - including terror attacks and hostage takings - to keep everyone safe.  Despite being on the run in the Middle East, ISIS and its supporters have repeatedly threatened football players and fans - and vowed revenge on President Vladimir Putin for Russia\u0027s involvement in the war in Syria.   Mocked-up posters depict terrorists armed with assault rifles and wearing combat gear in and around stadiums. One of the sick images shows explosions inside the stadium and the caption: It will be a massacre that has never been seen in history before. Another depicts a masked ISIS executioner standing over Argentina and Barcelona star Lionel Messi on the pitch at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium, which hosts Thursday\u0027s opening match between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia, and the final on July 15.  The caption reads: So strike them upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip.” Another image takes direct aim at Putin, calling him a disbeliever. That poster features a bearded fighter holding an assault rifle, a packed stadium and smoke from an explosion.  It reads: Putin you disbeliever. You will pay the price for killing Muslims. ISIS has been on the run in the Middle East after being driven out of its strongholds in Iraq and Syria - where Russian forces have backed government troops. Special security regimes are in place at Russia\u0027s World Cup host cities and other venues, including team training bases.

Neil told us that if he thinks young players are good enough he’ll stick them in and he’s done that.“That’s great for us and a great selling point if we’re trying to convince kids to join us rather than somebody else because you can see the pathway.”The former Livi, Coventry and Hibs man has learned plenty – good and bad – from every coach he’s come across but very much plans to be his own man.“I’ve picked up lots from the managers I’ve worked under – Chris Coleman at Coventry was great and so have Paul Hartley and Neil McCann been at Dundee.“I try to get bits and pieces from all the coaches I see, whether it’s good, bad or indifferent, and mould it all into the way I want to coach.“Being able to text guys like Chris Coleman and pick their brains is fantastic.“I’ve also seen some very, very bad things over my career and want to do the opposite!“I’ve got my own take on how I want to go about it and the way I want the game played.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/794603-806x564.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds 25 mile rule worked for kids under jim mclean but might prove difficult attracting experienced pros","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWhen Dundee United chairman Mike Martin last week announced the club would restore a historic rule from Jim McLean’s era, it sparked a host of memories for former defender Jackie Copland.\u0026nbspThe ex-Terror, who played for the Tannadice club from 1970-76, was a defensive stalwart under McLean – who brought him to the club from Stranraer after a spell in the juniors with Beith.As a young player, Jackie was subject to McLean’s rule that players must reside in the Tayside area while playing for the club.Something not dissimilar to Martin’s vision of Csaba Laszlo’s squad living within a 25-mile radius of the city.Jackie, who started and finished his football career at boyhood heroes St Mirren, admits the move will have pros and cons for United.“When I first moved up to Dundee it was a rule that you had to stay within the local area,” he said.“The club had a hostel in Broughty Ferry for young players, the likes of Walter Smith stayed there.“He would stay there during the week and travel home to the west at the weekend, like a lot of boys did.“I think it was beneficial as it gave the manager a chance to assess the young players.“It was fine at first but when I became a senior player I wasn’t happy with it.“I spoke to Jim McLean and, eventually, made an agreement that I would travel up with Andy Gray from Glasgow every day.“Trying to get senior players to come through might, obviously, become an issue. However, a few guys like Alan Gordon would travel through from Edinburgh.“It may be difficult, now, to get experienced players to relocate with the commitments they have like young kids and houses – that could cause an issue for Csaba.“That’s before you even get to the problem of fighting other teams financially.”Jackie left the club to re-join the Buddies for a successful period in their history from 1976-1983 before moving into various administration roles at the club.Of the move back, Jackie added: “Initially it worked at United but then it became a bit difficult.“The manager understood that and he was really good about it before I moved to St Mirren.“I always lived locally and followed the team so it felt right to move back at that time.“It’s funny how you get an association with a club and have an affinity with it.“I enjoyed my time at Tannadice as much as I did my spell at St Mirren.“Obviously, I finished my career at St Mirren and became a bit of a club legend but I still miss the Dundee days. I’m coming up in November for a reunion with the 1973/74 Scottish Cup Final team so it will be nice to catch up with everyone.”Of his former sides’ recent history, Jackie has watched United flounder from afar as St Mirren won promotion to the Premiership last season under the now-Sunderland boss Jack Ross.“Dundee United is a great club and I hope it can be restored in the top league because the fans deserve it.“St Mirren were going good. It was nice to see them get back up to the top flight.“Jack did really well and getting an offer like that (to boss Sunderland) nobody could begrudge him taking it.“Hopefully, Alan Stubbs continues the work and does well next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united set to win race for defender frans","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are expected to make their sixth signing of the summer in the shape of centre-back Frederic Frans.The former Partick Thistle defender has been the subject of a three-way bid between the Tangerines, the Jags and Ross County.However, United are expected to win that race.The 29-year-old left Firhill in 2016 to return to his native Belgium as captain of his former youth team Lierse SK.This summer he’s a free agent, however, after the Belgian club went bankrupt.And he is expected to arrive at Tannadice over the coming days to try to help the Tangerines to promotion back to the Premiership next season.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee keeper malherbe secured move to greek super league","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee squad member Jeremy Malherbe has headed to Greece after signing for Panionios.The French goalkeeper was brought in to cover first-choice Elliott Parish at the start of January after the departure of Scott Bain.However, despite being at the Dark Blues for six months, Malherbe didn’t manage to make a single appearance as Development goalkeeper Calum Ferrie overtook him in the pecking order.The 27-year-old arrived in Dundee after leaving Dinamo Brest in Belarus and now heads for the Greek Super League.Panionios finished in seventh spot in Greece’s top flight last season, only five points off a Europa League place.Malherbe has signed a two-year deal.Meanwhile, the arrival of former Hearts goalie Jack Hamilton this summer may see Ferrie and fellow young keeper Kyle Gourlay head out on loan in the coming season to gain experience.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1e51507a3be-564x564.jpg ","title":"james mcpake hopes to plunder us for new dundee fc talent","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are planning to plunder the United States for top young talent to bolster their improving youth set-up.The Dundee Juniors of Central Texas has been a project running since American owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms took control of the club.The set-up in Austin has been steadily growing and Dark Blues coach and former skipper James McPake is out there right now working with the youngsters.Speaking to the Tele, McPake admits he’ll be “outside his comfort zone” as he puts the kids through their paces in the strong Texan sun.He is tasked with heading a training camp over there as well as picking out some players good enough to come across and join his U/18 squad over in Dundee.He said: “Last year I spent some time over here with Tim Keyes and John Nelms just having a look at things.“The club have held camps over here every year, certainly since Tim and John have been at the club.“This time it’s a bit different because it’s an ID camp – I’ll be doing some training sessions and, hopefully, we can pick a couple to come across to Dundee and train with our U/18s.“I went last year just to have a look at what goes on but this time I’ll be coaching.“The facilities are great over there, too, it’s a great place to go to – though I’ll be needing to put on factor 500 with the heat!“We’ll be coaching in about 42 degrees instead of the minus two at Riverside with the wind in your face.”It might seem strange to some to see a whole squad of youngsters all training in Dundee kit in the middle of Texas but McPake is delighted to help “spread the name” of the club as much as possible.“The kids are all kitted out in Dundee gear and they love it,” he added.“Being part of a big club like Dundee is something they really enjoy and the club have done it really well. It’s great for them to have the affiliation but it’s also great for the club to be able to spread the name of Dundee.“You see Celtic and Man U shirts all over so it’s good to see some Dundee ones as well.”McPake accepts this week will be a challenge for him to test his skills as a young coach – particularly his communication skills.“You couldn’t say football, or soccer as they call it, is the biggest sport out here but it is really growing,” he said.“The MLS is getting bigger all the time and the national team has been quite successful, though they’re not at the World Cup this year.“The kids who are starting to choose football as their sport really take it seriously and they are desperate to learn.“I’m really looking forward to it. It is a challenge for me to get the kids to understand what I’m trying to tell them.“It’s the same language – though I struggle to speak English sometimes! – but there’s a lot of different words and sayings.“It will be a wee test for me to get my point across and then see how the players react. I’ll be out of my comfort zone and that’ll be a challenge.“Last year, we went and watched some of the age groups in training and I was really impressed with the standard of players.“As a coach, its great to work with kids like this because they are so keen to learn.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"storm hector high winds closes tay road bridge to all vehicles other than cars","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMotorists in Dundee and Tayside have been urged to drive with caution as Storm Hector batters the area.Gusts exceeding 60mph have battered the area leading to the closure of the Tay Road Bridge to all vehicles \u0026#8211 other than cars.A 30mph speed limit is also in force.\u0026mdash Tay Road Bridge (@tay_road_bridge) June 14, 2018The Met Office has placed Dundee and the surounding area under a yellow \u0026#8216be alert\u0026#8217 warning for high winds.Bonnie Diamond, meteorologist at the national forecaster, said the gusts were the result of a low pressure system moving in, dispelling the mild and sunny conditions of recent times.She said: “We’re losing the high pressure we’ve been blessed with in the last few weeks.

People want it open more often and to accommodate all age groups. It could be based on water fountains/jets, as in an installation in Southend which includes colour changing lighting.Another option is to create a three-storey adjacent lido with open-air pool on the top floor and spa facilities on the first floor.A further option is to take over the nearby council-owned Nairn Leisure Centre pool, give it a glass roof and create a training and competition facility to complement a lido.The lido proposal was inspired by Bath\u0027 dramatic Thermae Spa.Lessees of the neighbouring links tearoom and James\u0026rsquo Caf\u0026eacute have put forward proposals to improve their facilities.Community leaders are excited but have urged sensitive handling of the initiative.Nairn River Community Council chairman Tommy Hogg said: \"That area is part of Nairn\u0027 heritage so they\u0026rsquove got to do it sympathetically or it\u0026rsquoll cause massive problems.\"A council consultation keen to include input from local schools and youth groups is expected to follow in August.Planning officers say \"the time is ripe for a development plan\".Their report suggests building on a trail around Nairn from the Links through Viewfield and along the riverside featuring various attractions for \"people to linger, to learn about Nairn, to take part in an activity and to enjoy their surroundings\".Each point would incorporate a theme and\u0026nbspa dolphin-inspired artwork has been mooted.A draft plan is currently evolving for Nairn\u0027 77-pontoon harbour and waterfront to improve the harbour basin, surrounding buildings and maximise its potential to boost Nairn\u0027 economy.Planned projects include expansion of the pontoon system, increasing capacity to 97 boats and to develop a watersports centre.Other than driving to the links, people generally walk there as there is no public transport to the beach area.The planners say \"there may be an opportunity to operate a land train type tourist train in the summer months, taking people round the links, the harbour, Viewfield and Fishertown.\"Alternatively, there may be potential to develop a miniature railway, of the type used at Whin Park in Inverness.\"Thursday 14 Jun 2018 6:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111982.jpg","title":"Stateside search for market dog answers","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED local historian is hoping a letter to America may finally solve the mystery of a faithful dog that died in a catastrophic fire in Inverness in the late 19th century.Norman Newton has been delving into the poignant tale of the canine superhero that refused to leave the butcher\u0027 shop it was guarding when the inferno destroyed what is now the Victorian Market in June 1889.The story will feature in a trailblazing digital project to be launched by Highland Council at the end of this month, bringing city legends and landmarks to life \u0026ndash but despite extensive research no one has been able to discover the dog\u0027 name.Undeterred, Mr Newton is pinning his last hopes on a Scottish-born woman now living in New York \u0026ndash the great-granddaughter of the butcher who owned the dog.\"She is perhaps the last possibility for more information about the fire and the dog through family stories,\" said Mr Newton, of Blackwell Road, Culloden.\"The rational part of me says it is unlikely.

They will write it, rehearse it and perform it at the end.“It means a lot to get this funding as it can be quite expensive to do anything with the creative arts such as hire tutors and we have never had the chance to do this before.“It will be the children’s first time to access anything like this. We have removed the barriers of funding and they are getting the opportunity to access things that children in other areas are maybe already accessing.“The kids will decide on the show when we meet up with the production company.“It will have both music and dance and I’m sure they will come up with something brilliant.” Jazz Scotland was also among the recipients, receiving £7,540 to stage a festival celebrating young jazz musicians.Finley Campbell, from the Aberdeen University Jazz organisation, said they were delighted to be running a festival in conjunction with Jazz Scotland.He said: “We were overjoyed to get the news and receive this funding boost.“We decided that we will run a festival to showcase young jazz musicians and we are really excited about that.“We will be putting on workshops and we are looking to do it in the next academic term. We will be planning this during the summer break.”The remaining budget will be given through the Year of Young People commission grants which will give up to £2,000 to people aged 16-25 to create five new artistic works.A sum of £5,500 is also being given towards a Year of Young People showcase event highlighting local talent in conjunction with the Youth Ambassadors.Councillor Lesley Dunbar, vice convener for education operational delivery, said: “We have had a phenomenal response to our £100,000 Year of Young People Creative Fund and we had, in fact, a total of 30 applications for funding support totalling £133,000.“We are delighted to be able to support 20 of those projects which were successful in their applications.“It was our young people themselves who were instrumental in choosing the successful projects which will benefit from £84,000 of funding.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"plans for 500 homes in north east could be approved next week","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans for 500 homes in a north-east village could be approved next week.Bancon Homes has applied for the development in Mintlaw that would include the houses, business and retail space and services for the elderly.The Buchan area committee has been asked to give the green light for planning permission in principle.If approved 125 affordable homes could be built.Director of infrastructure services Stephen Archer said: “It is considered that the proposed development complies with the policies and principles outlined in the Aberdeenshire Local Development Plan 2017.“The development would be in keeping with the site allocation.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cadets flag up lochgilpheads big day","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 14/06/18, 1:03 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAfter weeks of brilliant sunshine, the weather took a turn for the damp just in time for the flag raising ceremony.This annual midweek event marks the beginning of Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations, and cadets from D (Argyll) Company ignored the rain to perform the flag raising with their usual efficiency.\u0026nbspThe flag was saluted as it was raised accompanied by tunes from piper John Hunt, before Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day chairman Geordie Rhodick inspected the assembled cadets and thanked them for their attendance.Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day will take place on Saturday June 16, starting at midday with a march down Argyll Street from the Drill Hall, followed by a parade on the front green and an afternoon of fun activities for all the family.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12690657.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/lhr_ayp_060618abba_1.jpg","title":"abba tribute show set roll","story":"NewsABBA tribute show set to roll into Ayr and tickets are available NOWIf you Take A Chance On Me then you’ll surely be turning into a Dancing Queen and a Super Trouper.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:39, 12 JUN 2018NewsABBA Forever show in Ayr (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn upcoming show in town will have you saying Thank You For The Music.

The astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses. The council ARE pressing ahead with fees at a third Troon car park, at Bellevue in Prestwick and Ayr Blackburn. They argued the \u0026pound2 charge would destroy much-needed trade and lead to chaos in surrounding streets in Troon The U-turn was revealed by Councillor Craig Mackay at Troon Community Council last Tuesday. He managed to finally nail down an answer from his officials, admitting: “This issue has caused confusion within the council.” There will be no charges at the car park at the Walker Hall or the Italian Gardens.  But council officers are pressing ahead with a \u0026pound2 fee at the South Beach car park next to Royal Troon. This lead to anger from Community Councillor Robert Milligan, who said: “I suggest if you are going to charge for South Beach you actually need to provide loos, even temporary between May and September, to meet demand. If people are paying for parking the least we can do is to have toilet facilities without peeing in the dunes. “People are urinating in the sand dunes and residents can see it from their houses.” At the community council police revealed Troon only gets a traffic warden once every 2.8 days. And townspeople feared cars would be abandoned on the streets rather than pay for parking. The Ayrshire Post has led the way on the issue, revealing Troon has NEVER had to pay parking fees. Councillor Mackay said: “ We were working on the basis of parking charges being introduced to three car parks in Troon.  “I had a meeting with senior officers to discuss concerns of residents and businesses, in particular at the Walker Hall. “The knock-on conserquences are complex, particularly with displacement into residential streets.” He finally got an admission the council were axing the charges in a statement from SNP party colleague Ian Cochrane. Councillor Mackay added: “I was still struggling to get full clarity. “Traffic Orders are being progressed at Royal Troon, Belevue Road in Prestwick and Blackburn Road in Ayr. “It came as a surprise to me as the statement said no other parking charges are proposed at this time and that is quite a changes from what we were looking at.” Troon council vice-chairman Dougie Graham added: “We will wait to see what happens.” Five days after being asked for a comment on the U-turn, South Ayrshire Council would only say: “We’re currently finalising plans for the introduction of charges at Blackburn Road, Bellevue Road and Troon seafront car parks – all of which will require a new Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). We’ll soon be getting the TRO process underway, which will include a period of public consultation, and further details on this will be shared in due course.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club.

Stuart Laing gets a glittering OBE for nearly 50 years hard graft in the shiny world of jewellery. And Kirsty Letton is now an MBE after more than four decades of dedication to Scottish curling. That they live within 500 yards of each other in Troon is highly noteworthy in that NOBODY else who lives in mainland Ayrshire received anything this year. Stuart,68, has been honoured not just for running the family’s firm Laings, but his foundation of a UK consortium that allowed independents to flourish. He said: “I am thrilled and delighted to speak about it . . . this has been very difficult not to mention.  “I am proud and honoured, but also very humbled as well.” In 1970 he joined the family firm which was begun 130 years earlier. He expanded it to seven branches and started the Houlden (his mother’s maiden name) buying and professional services group for independent jewellers. Stuart remains active as executive chairman of Laings, though his son-in-law Joe Walsh is now chief executive. The father-of-three and now grandad-to-five has been such an influence in the jewellery market he’s regarded by the trade throughout the world. He said: “Strengthening and creating a strong, independent retail sector and giving the UK industry a global identity has been extremely rewarding.” “But this honour is for my entire family and colleagues as a lot of people have been with me on this journey.”  Stuart and his wife Lynda have three children - son Simon and daughters Susanna Laing, and Wendy Walsh. Stuart added: “I would like to pay tribute to my wife Lynda, she has been a wonderful support, a real rock. “We have travelled the globe together representing the UK trade.” He also created the ‘Jewellers of Excellence’ brand, which is a hallmark of trust within the industry. Stuart has been involved in all aspects of the industry and was the only UK Director of SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie), a renowned association of the best jewellers in the world, in co-operation with high-end watch houses. Curling champion and coach Kirsty Letton reckons her MBE is an accolade for the entire sport. She says: “Of course I am thrilled and proud. It was a big surprise, I must admit.”  And so are the family - husband Jimmy and children Avril, who now lives in Ascot, and Keith who is in Grenada. Superfit Kirsty - now a 77-year-old grandmother of three - is still playing on the rink as well as coaching at Ayr and manages to find the time to grab an oar for some coastal rowing. Last year she picked up a Sportscotland lifetime volunteering award. And although moving to Ayrshire 21 years ago and joining the Troon Portland club the link with her orginal Glasgow four has never been broken. The highlight of Kirsty’s playing career was winning senior silver in the World Championships in Finland in 2008. She is particularly proud of motivating South Ayrshire primary pupils to have fun on the ice, with 269 youngsters participating in her taster sessions last season.  As well as inspiring the stars of tomorrow, Kirsty instigated the strongly contested World Senior Curling Championships in 2000. She also set up the Glynhill Ladies Curling International event, which attracts world-class teams. Kirsty added: “I don’t know where I would be without curling. It has been a huge part of my life for 40 years. “Last week Ayr Curling Club got the active schools gold award for South Ayrshire and it is things like that which keep me going.” Ayrshire’s Lord-Lieutenant Iona McDonald congratulated the pair. She said: “They have made a considerable contribution to our communities and I am sure that this award comes as a great surprise, as many of them do not seek any recognition for the work that they do. •The Edinburgh-based business grandee Sir Brian Gammell Ivory, gets a CBE for his chairmanship role at Dumfries House.

Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”. An average of 11.7 days were lost to absence by local government employees (all staff bar teachers) in 2010. The revised figure stands at 10.06 days for 2017/18. A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Work to start on Traquair  39 s   200k footpath trails","story":"FUNDING for a \u0026pound200,000 project to create pathways in and around Traquair has been approved.\nAnd work on the links to Innerleithen and the Southern Upland Way are expected to start later this month.\nForestry Commission Scotland has agreed to back the plans which will see new routes developed between Innerleithen and both Traquair village and Traquair House, a new pathway from the town to the Mountain Bike car park, and also a new trail route connecting Traquair with the Southern Upland Way.\nA range of themed interpretation boards, picnic benches and perch benches will also be built as part of the project.\nIt is estimated that around 32 hectares of woodland will be made accessible with the new paths.\nCatherine Maxwell Stuart from Traquair House said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the path network is taking shape at last.\n\"It has been a long held desire to make Traquair more accessible by foot and particularly for local people to take advantage of the woodlands around Traquair which have previously been difficult to access.\n\"The new views that are being opened up with the new footpaths are really breath-taking.\n\"We are looking forward to making the dream become a reality.\nA community consultation exercise was held in November, 2016, by the Traquair House Charitable Trust, to gauge opinion on creating new pathways.\nMore than 60 members of the public gave their enthusiastic support for the multi-use paths through Traquair woodlands.\nOver the past 18 months a management plan was developed to produce an exciting combination of new access, interpretation and woodland management.\nAnd the submitted plans were this week approved by Forestry Commission Scotland.\nPreparatory work has already taken place over the last year in the woodlands through the approved Forest Design Plan with the felling of three woodlands and thinning of a further two woodlands to ensure work on the paths can be started straight away.\nEach individual access route will be opened when completed over the next 18 months.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"A7 driver was almost five times the legal limit","story":"A MOTORIST who was almost five times the legal alcohol limit while driving on the A7 has been banned from the road for 14 months at Selkirk Sheriff Court.\nHeather Condon had a breath/alcohol count of 103 microgrammes - the legal limit being 22 - after police caught up with her at Heriot on March 9 last year.\nThe 42-year-old of Moss Place, Livingston, had denied the offence but was found guilty after a trial.\nIn addition to the disqualification period, she was fined \u0026pound400.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Lowood Bridge closure  SBC release update","story":"GOOD news for motorists - council bosses have confirmed that works to Lowood Bridge are set to be complete in time for Melrose Festival Week.\nThe project is in its final stages and remains on schedule to be completed by Monday, June 18, the day of the Melrosian Rideout.\nSo far, the temporary scaffolding has been removed, which means works on the bridge deck area can start.\nRepairs to the bridge\u0027s stonework are now complete, as well as resurfacing of the Waverley Road/Lowood Road junction.

reinstate a full-time service in the town.\nIn February 2017, the Border  and Peeblesshire News reported that the concession within the Daymart Newsagents on the town\u0026rsquos High Street had closed.\nThis sparked a six-week consultation by the Post Office on proposals to operate a one-day mobile service in the town.\nThe consultation was met with a huge backlash from local politicians and residents, who set up a petition to restore full Post Office services in Innerleithen and the launch of an appeal for local businesses to come forward to take on a concession within their stores.\nJust weeks after the announcement, local businessman Andrew Caldwell, of Caldwell\u0026rsquos Ices, came up with a plan to open the service within his store.\nBut a row over the opening hours with Post Office bosses soon put a stop to the idea.\nWhile the town has been without a permanent service, a mobile service has operated for several hours each Friday in Innerleithen, forcing residents who urgently need to make postal deliveries to travel east to Walkerburn, or west to Peebles to do so.\nA spokesperson from the Post Office told us that, while plans are yet to be finalised, further details about the reopening, including information about the range of services that will be on offer to customers, will be released in due course.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Work to begin on

months to gain permission to repair several memorials in the village graveyard.\nAnd now they have also received \u0026pound15,000 of funding from the Toddleburn (Parish of Stow) Wind Farm Community Fund to help with the work.\nThe graveyard, which contains the remains of Stow\u0026rsquos Auld Kirk as well as memorials dating back to the 17th century, has been in need of repair for decades.\nStow and Fountainhall Community Council worked with Scottish Borders Council and Historic Environment Scotland to gain the required permissions as the Auld Kirk is a scheduled monument.\nThe Auld Kirk, which was consecrated in 1242, has previously been painstakingly restored by local resident Robin McMillan.\nAnd the restoration of the graveyard will complete his work to showcase part of the fascinating medieval history of Stow.\nAlistair Riddell of Stow and Fountainhall Community Council told the Border : \u0026ldquoThe repairs to the graveyard have long been a priority for the local community and it is great to finally get the first grant of money to allow these works to go ahead.\n\"There is a lot of specialist work to be undertaken and the repairs may take several years to complete.\n\"However, once finished the old graveyard will become a real focus for locals and visitors alike.\nStow\u0027s history includes a visit in 1142 by King David I, a visit in 1297 by William Wallace and a visit in 1513 by Queen Margaret Tudor, wife of James IV, prior to the battle of Flodden.\nThe restoration, which is widely supported across the local community, will commence this summer with the repair of an iconic monument, after the required funding was donated by residents of Stow.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Mum and baby left shaken after crossing near miss in

Immediately Jewson Campbeltown chipped in for a couple, leaving 13 up for grabs.CDJFA said a small part of this will help towards the running costs of the festival. The remainder will purchase new equipment.In June 2012, what started out as a return exchange with Lochgilphead resulted in CDJFA\u0026#8217s idea for an annual football festival. Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter how dare you laugh","story":"Perhaps you shouldn’t read this. It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans.

Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.

He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road. Mr Dickie said \u0026ldquoother retailers were interested in that site and they were looking to progress plans \u0026ldquorelatively quickly."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7919368.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Call for community to invest in Humbie wind farm","story":"              A COMMUNITY energy project is urging investors to back a project which will operate 12 wind turbines near Humbie and help tackle fuel poverty.  The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7868119.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"12 new rules the council is making over selfish parking in Musselburgh","story":"              A RAFT of traffic restrictions are to be introduced in Musselburgh to control inconsiderate parking.

The Prime Minister saw off defeat on the EU Withdrawal Bill at the last minute on Tuesday by persuading rebels that she would offer concessions to address their concerns about being given a truly \u0026ldquomeaningful vote on the final Brexit deal.  But an amendment tabled by Brexit Secretary David Davis on Thursday gives MPs no chance to block a \u0026ldquono deal EU withdrawal if agreement has not been reached with Brussels by January 21 next year.  Instead, MPs would be allowed to vote only on a \u0026ldquoneutral motion, confirming that they have considered a statement by a minister on the issue. And crucially, the statement would be unamendable.  Leading pro-EU Conservative Dominic Grieve told the Press Association: \u0026ldquoIt is unacceptable in my view. It is not in accordance with the normal procedures of the House of Commons and it totally negates the point of the amendment, which was to give MPs a say.  Mr Grieve indicated that the final text of the amendment tabled in the House of Lords at the last possible moment on Thursday had been changed from the wording which he believed had been agreed earlier in the day.  He told PA: \u0026ldquoAfter what had\u0026nbsp been a very sensible negotiation, I thought we had an agreement, and at the last moment, part of the text was changed to make the final motion unamendable if there isn\u0026rsquot a deal by the end of January 21.  \u0026ldquoI think it is unacceptable because it seems to me to be contrary to what the whole intention was behind this whole amendment.  Mr Grieve previously tabled his own proposals, which would have allowed Parliament to dictate the next steps the Government should take if no deal was reached by the end of February. This was seen as a means for MPs to ensure that the UK did not crash out of the EU without a deal.  However, the Grieve amendment was not put to a vote on Tuesday, after would-be rebels accepted \u0026ldquopersonal assurances from the PM that a compromise would be found.  Instead, the majority of the pro-EU Tories backed the Government in voting down a Lords amendment to give them the power to tell ministers to go back to Brussels and renegotiate.  Now Conservative peer Viscount Hailsham has re-tabled Mr Grieve\u0026rsquos amendment in the House of Lords, setting the scene for a fresh Government defeat when the Bill returns to the Second Chamber on Monday.

Pro-EU Tories were quick to voice their anger.  Shortly before the text of the amendment was tabled, former minister Anna Soubry tweeted to say that \u0026ldquodeal or no deal Parliament will have a meaningful vote and \u0026hellip there will be no hard Brexit.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.

A new survey found one in four Scottish pupils from a services background attended at least seven schools as a result of parents being posted to different locations across the UK and beyond.  In one extreme case a pupil had been to 27 different schools between starting nursery and leaving secondary.  As a result of the disruption some 70 per cent said they lacked confidence, 71 per cent had experienced anxiety and 60 per cent said they had found studying difficult.  In addition, one in five said they had experienced difficulties with friendships and 44 per cent said they had felt isolated.  The Royal Caledonian Education Trust (RCET), a 200-year-old charity for armed forces children, said pupils from a military background were one third less likely to go to university than their civilian peers.  Moira Leslie, education manager at RCET, said children from such backgrounds should be considered alongside other groups who face disadvantages when they apply to higher education.  Currently, universities give preferential treatment to pupils from the poorest backgrounds to recognise the impact of poverty on attainment.  Mrs Leslie said: \u0026ldquoNot everyone is affected, but as our survey shows there can be significant disruption to the education of pupils from armed forces families, she said.  \u0026ldquoPupils in this situation can find it difficult to study, particularly if a parent or parents are serving in an active situation or because they are absent.  \u0026ldquoIf pupils have moved between schools they can find it difficult to settle in a new environment and there may be differences in the coursework or teaching they experience.  \u0026ldquoWhere they can also find it difficult is when they have an established group of friends that they have to leave behind and start all over again.  Mrs Leslie said RCET was concerned pupils who would potentially thrive at university were being denied the opportunity.  \u0026ldquoBecause of these experiences they should be encouraged and supported to include that in personal statements when they apply to university.  \u0026ldquoThere should also be a way for universities to identify these applications so they can make allowances.  Five years ago a study of Scottish children who had parents serving in Afghanistan found their levels of stress were particularly high in the build up to their deployment with their worst fears being that their father or mother would be injured or killed.  Academics from City University London, who interviewed more than 50 Scottish pupils, also found they felt apprehensive when their parents were away from home and had difficulty sleeping. Children between the ages of eight and 11 were particularly affected.  The issue was discussed at the Scotland\u0026rsquos Fair Access Conference in Perth, organised by the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).  The event focused on the mental health and wellbeing of college and university students.  A key theme was how to improve support for the increasing number of students with caring responsibilities.  Shirley-Anne Somerville, the Higher Education Secretary, said every student should have an equal chance to fulfil their potential.  \u0026ldquoAs well as supporting access to courses, it is essential colleges and universities provide appropriate support for students\u0026rsquo health and wellbeing, she said.  Luke Humberstone, president of student body NUS Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe need to see institutions acknowledging and tackling the barriers that prospective students can face.  Mike Cantlay, chairman of the SFC, said: \u0026ldquoThis important national event will be a catalyst for better understanding and faster progress."},{"url":null,"title":"SNP MSP accused of  unreliable  evidence in defamation race case","story":"              COURT evidence given by an SNP MSP under oath has been labelled \u0026ldquounreliable, self-serving and evasive in the closing submission of a \u0026pound100,000 defamation case.

Ms McAnulty denies making the remark.

She initially said the conversation was in late May 2015, but it later emerged she and Ms McAnulty were in her car on 20 June.  Steven Bonnar, a current SNP councillor in North Lanarkshire, testified he was in the car on that date with the two women, and heard no racist remarks being made.  After four days of evidence in April, the case resumed - and concluded - yesterday.  The court previously heard Ms McAnulty and Ms McCulloch were on rival sides of a \u0026ldquotoxic turf war within the local SNP, with two camps vying for dominance.  Ms McAnulty was allied to former Coatbridge MP Phil Boswell, who wanted reform, while Ms McCulloch was allied to Mr Lyle, whose group wanted to maintain their grip on power.

A Daily Record story three days later led to Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos suspension by the SNP.  In his submission to Lord Uist, Mr McBrearty said Mr Lyle, who was not present in court, had been a \u0026ldquobit part player.  However he criticised his evidence, including his attempt to \u0026ldquodissociate himself from the feuding, and his claim he knew nothing about the racism complaint for three days, despite his childhood friend and employee sending it from his office.  He said it was \u0026ldquocompletely implausible that Mr Lyle, who previously denied any \u0026ldquoinput to the complaint or giving misleading evidence, had been unaware of it until it appeared in the Record.  Mr McBrearty said the email was part of a targeted campaign against Ms McAnulty that including two other damaging Daily Record stories about her and race in previous weeks.  He said Ms McCulloch could not credibly explain why she emailed 13 people, only three of whom dealt with party discipline, nor explain why she waited until February.

Mr McBrearty said it would make no sense for Mr Bonnar, who told the court he \u0026ldquoabhors racism, to concoct a story about being in Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos car to help a racist.  Calling his evidence \u0026ldquostraight-forward and compelling, he asked: \u0026ldquoWhy would Mr Bonnar risk everything in giving evidence in support of someone who has made racist statements?  He said it was very difficult to think Mr Bonnar could be mistaken about being in the car, not least because the day in question was the launch of his successful by-election campaign.  However he said some of Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos witnesses, who said Mr Bonnar may have been in a different car, were understandably mistaken in recalling small events from 2015.  Summing up, he invited Lord Uist to find Ms McAnulty did not make the remark attributed to her, and that Ms McCulloch knew the allegation to be untruthful.

He suggested compensatory damages be set at \u0026pound100,000 if Lord Uist accepted Ms McCulloch intended the complaint to leak to the press, or would have expected it to leak, causing Ms McAnulty greater damage and upset, or at around \u0026pound40,000 otherwise.  In his submission, Mr Dunlop attacked Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos evidence, saying problems with in it cast doubt on her whole case.  He said that at an SNP meeting in 2012 she was \u0026ldquoheedless of racial sensitivities by questioning whether a senior Asian member, Dr Imtiaz Majid, later an SNP councillor, directed the votes of other Asian members.  He said Ms McAnulty was also prepared to \u0026ldquosully the reputation of other witnesses by accusing them of perjury, fabrication and attempting to pervert the course of justice.  He said her \u0026ldquodemonstrable mendacity\u0026hellip taints her evidence irretrievably.

He also said Mr Bonnar had been \u0026ldquolying about being in the car, and that there had been no room in it for him as the back seat was full of campaign materials, and that his evidence conflicted with there being child locks on the back door.  He said it was \u0026ldquoremarkable he had waited \u0026ldquomonths after the Daily Record story about the racism complaint to tell SNP HQ that he had been in the vehicle.  He said the evidence demonstrated convincingly that Mr Bonnar had not been in the car, and that was \u0026ldquofatal to Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos case.  He said Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos evidence had been \u0026ldquocredible and \u0026ldquoreliable, and it made no sense for her to concoct a lie about a talk in a car if Mr Bonnar had been there too and could simply contradict her.  Mr McBrearty said that assumed Ms McCulloch was a \u0026ldquogood liar, not a bad one.  He also rejected Mr Dunlop\u0026rsquos assertion that Ms McAnulty made a racist remark in 2012, merely an ambiguous one, and denied she lied under oath in court.

Scotland\u0026rsquos information watchdog found evidence journalists have been \u0026ldquosignificantly less likely to receive information in previous years, with \u0026ldquounjustifiable, significant delays and disregard for legal timescales.  It comes amid on ongoing row over the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos handling of FoI requests and the involvement of special advisers.  Critics branded the findings \"outrageous\", and accused the SNP of meddling in the FoI process to \"stop bad news happening\".  In a\u0026nbsphumiliating intervention, the Scottish Information Commissioner Daren Fitzhenry called on the Government to end its practice of\u0026nbsptreating journalists, MSPs and political researchers differently \u0026ldquobecause of who or what they are.  His report found: \u0026ldquoJournalists, together with MSPs and political researchers, are expressly made subject to a different process for clearance than other requester groups.  \u0026ldquoThis is inconsistent with the applicant-blind principle of FoI legislation. Their requests are almost invariably subjected to an additional layer of clearance which is likely to delay consideration of the case.  In 2015/16, only 27 per cent of media requests were met with full disclosure, compared with 42 per cent of FoIs submitted by others.  When she took office, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon vowed to lead the most open and accessible government ever.  But Scottish Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins insisted the report \u0026ldquoexposes Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos secret Scotland.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt reveals an SNP government which not only deliberately stands in the way of legally-binding FoI requests made by the media, but goes to great lengths to delay or influence what information is provided.  \u0026ldquoThat is completely contrary to Scotland\u0026rsquos FoI legislation. People will see this report and conclude the SNP government is trying to stop bad news happening, and its woeful performance being publicised, by meddling in this process.  \u0026ldquoThat is outrageous, and all cabinet ministers involved, and indeed the First Minister, have urgent questions to answer.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos parliamentary business manager Rhoda Grant called on Ms Sturgeon to \u0026ldquoaddress the findings of this report and apologise for bending the law to suit her narrow political interests.  Scottish Green MSP Andy Wightman said: \u0026ldquoThis is a damning report, and vindicates the complaints of many journalists and researchers that Scottish ministers are slow and inconsistent in how they release information that the public are entitled to.  Mr Fitzhenry launched his formal investigation at Holyrood\u0027s request after a series of complaints were raised by journalists last year.  He said that by singling journalists and researchers out, SNP ministers were offending the spirit of FoI legislation and potentially damaging trust.  The Scottish Government said it would accept the findings of the report in full, and confirmed\u0026nbspits internal guidance will be updated with immediate effect.  Joe Fitzpatrick, minister for parliamentary business Joe Fitzpatrick, said: \u0026ldquoBeing open and transparent is a priority set out in our current Programme for Government.  \u0026ldquoWe welcomed and cooperated fully with the Scottish Information Commissioner\u0026rsquos review and are happy to accept his recommendations in full to support our continued improvement.  \u0026ldquoAs the report highlights, we have already implemented a number of changes that have resulted in significant improvements to our FoI performance.  \"In the first five months of 2018 we responded to 93 per cent of FoI requests on time, exceeding the 90 per cent target set by the Information Commissioner and a 10% increase on last year.  \u0026ldquoOutside the FoI process, last year the Scottish Government responded to over 5,000 queries from journalists in a matter of hours."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7919182.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Watch  Ian Blackford leads dramatic SNP walk-out from Commons","story":"              THE SNP has staged a dramatic walk-out in the House of Commons after Ian Blackford its Westminster leader defied the Speaker, insisting the UK Government had shown total disrespect and discourtesy to Scotland by its actions over the Brexit Bill.  The Conservatives, he later suggested, had returned to the days of Margaret Thatcher and were acting in an \u0026ldquoanti-Scottish way.  In developments that stunned MPs during Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, the Nationalist leader attacked the Conservative Government, which he said was implementing, through its legislation, a power-grab against Holyrood and had not even given Scottish MPs the chance to debate it during Tuesday\u0026rsquos consideration of the Bill.    Using a rare parliamentary device, he called for a \u0026ldquoprivate sitting of Parliament, which would have removed the public from the chamber\u0026rsquos gallery.  The move appeared to take John Bercow, the Speaker, Theresa May, and others totally by surprise.  As the chamber descended into confusion, Mr Bercow hurriedly consulted the Commons lawyers and suggested a vote on Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos request be taken after PMQs. But the Highland MP insisted he wanted an immediate vote, declaring: \u0026ldquoI beg to move.  At which point as Nationalist MPs cheered, Opposition MPs jeered. The Speaker took more advice, repeating that the vote should take place at the end of PMQs. \u0026ldquoThat is the end of the matter, declared Mr Bercow, calling the PM to respond.  But Mr Blackford continued to stand as the Speaker urged him amid the roar of the chamber to sit down, insisting: \u0026ldquoNo, you\u0026rsquore not moving anything.    As the volume in the chamber rose further on all sides, Labour frontbenchers were engaged in hurried private conversations.  As the Speaker again insisted a vote could take place at the end of PMQs, SNP backbencher David Linden shouted: \u0026ldquoNow!  Mr Bercow responded by telling the Glasgow MP: \u0026ldquoI say to you in the kindest possible spirit, don\u0026rsquot tell me what the procedures of this House are. I\u0026rsquom telling you there can be a vote at the end of this session and not now.  As Mr Blackford rose again to applause from some of his SNP colleagues, the Speaker shouted: \u0026ldquoOrder. Resume your seat Mr Blackford! He then said in light of the party leader\u0026rsquos refusal to resume his seat, he ordered him to leave the chamber immediately.  At first, the Highland MP did not go. As MPs continued to shout, Mr Bercow could he heard saying to colleagues: \u0026ldquoHe won\u0026rsquot, so we\u0026rsquoll have to have the vote.  At one point, Joanna Cherry, the Nationalist MP, could be seen shouting at the Tory benches before Mr Blackford dramatically walked out followed by his SNP colleagues. Ms Cherry as she left waved to the Speaker, saying: \u0026ldquoGoodbye.  As the noise level began to subside, Mr Bercow said it was a pity as Nationalist MPs had questions down on the Order Paper.                         .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default .vjs-tech { position: static !important }                       .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default { height: auto !important width: 100% !important}                       .vjs-playlist-description { display: none }                       .vjs-big-play-button { top: 0pxleft: 0pxright: 0pxbottom: 0pxmargin: auto }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist { background-color: #f7f4f1color: #000min-width: auto }                       .vjs-playlist cite { overflow: initialtext-overflow: initialwhite-space: initialfont-weight: 600font-size: 16px }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist time { color: #fff }                       cite.vjs-playlist-name { text-align: left }                       .story-credits { margin-top: 20px }                       #liveMultiHide .vjs-dock-description { display: none }                       .vjs-playlist-thumbnail { margin-right: 10px !IMPORTANT }                        /* Style the overlay */                        /* Hide the overlay */                        .hide-countdown {                            display: none                        }                        .hide-overlay {                            display: none                        }                        /* Style the overlay */                        .vjs-overlay,                        .vjs-overlay.vjs-overlay-top {                            position: absolute                            top: 0px                            left: 0px                        }                        .vjs-overlay p {                            width: 100px                            background-color: #000000                            color: #fff                            padding: 10px                            margin: 0                            margin-bottom: 0                            border-radius: 0px                            text-align: left                        }                                               width=\"100%\"                            data-account=\"64298557001\"                            data-player=\"rkgvgWjWCG\"                            data-embed=\"default\"                            data-video-id=\"5797134990001\"                            class=\"video-js\"                            playsinline                            data-random-id=\"1055702881\"                            controls  Earlier, in Commons exchanges, the SNP leader had pointed out that despite the declaration that Scotland would be a partner of equals in the UK, the Tory Government had pressed ahead with a \u0026ldquopower-grab in direct opposition to Scotland\u0026rsquos Parliament and had \u0026ldquosilenced Scotland\u0026rsquos voice.

Pointing to how there was just 15 minutes on Tuesday night for debate on the Scottish clause to the EU Withdrawal Bill, the PM blamed Labour for using \u0026ldquoprocedural manoeuvres in calling unnecessary votes.  Mr Blackford replied that the reality was powers enshrined under the 1998 Scotland Act were being \u0026ldquograbbed back by Whitehall and Scottish MPs were \u0026ldquonot given the courtesy of even debating it last night it\u0026rsquos a democratic outrage. The people of Scotland will not be disrespected by this Parliament.  Outside the chamber, the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not prepared to stand back and see Westminster engage in a power-grab against the Scottish Parliament and to do so on a basis that Scotland\u0026rsquos parliamentarians have not been given the opportunity to debate what this Parliament is doing. It\u0026rsquos an outrage.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWe are going to make sure we will be robust in using parliamentary devices to make sure we can hold this Government to account. We are in a situation that the Westminster Government has shown utter disrespect to the Scottish Parliament and the people of Scotland by wilfully ignoring that the fact that the Scottish Parliament has refused to give a consent motion.    \u0026ldquoThey are now acting outwith the support of the Scottish people. The Conservatives have returned to where they were before in acting in a manner that is anti-Scottish. We are not having it.  But Scottish Conservative MP Kirstene Hair decried the SNP\u0026rsquos actions.  \"This rehearsed move just demonstrated that the SNP care more about headlines than actually achieving anything for Scotland.  \"They are the masters of manufactured grievance and the people of Scotland are sick of it.  \"The SNP have played games with the constitution, played games with Brexit and now are playing games with Parliament.

Meanwhile in the chamber, Mr Bercow at the end of PMqs looked up and praised a baby in the public gallery, who, he said, had been \"a model of impeccable behaviour\" despite the \"turbulence\" of the proceedings."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7919173.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Scots call time on traditional opening hours","story":"              SCOTS are calling time on traditional opening hours because they no longer fit in with their busy lives, new research has found.  The decline of traditional nine-to-five jobs and the rise of flexible working and 24-hour shift patterns has led to calls for businesses to provide more services outside of the \u0027normal\u0027 working day.\u0026nbsp  The changing way people spent their leisure time was reflected in a study by Barclays which found that they want services to be available round-the-clock.  Calls were made for museums to stay open late into the evening and for cinemas to show films into the early hours of the morning.  People also want to see takeaway hours extended through the night so they can pick up a meal until 5am.  But while habits are changing, the report found that only a quarter of UK hospitality and leisure businesses recognise this growing demand, and said that opening hours are not keeping up with changes to modern working lives.    Jamie Grant, Head of Corporate Banking for Barclays in Scotland, believes that businesses were losing out by not responding to the dawning of 24-hour culture.  He said: \u0026ldquoAdapting to the changing consumer demand presents a substantial opportunity for Scottish businesses.\u0026nbsp  \"Our research has shown that leisure operators across the country could access a staggering \u0026pound6.75bn per annum by accommodating their customers\u0026rsquo evolving needs which have been brought on by changing working patterns.\u0026nbsp  \"While that may be a challenge for some providers, understanding the value of the opportunity makes the prize more tangible.\"\u0026nbsp  The new Barclays Corporate Banking Hospitality and Leisure report, Open All Hours? found that only a quarter of Scots now work traditional 9-5 hours, with nearly a one-in-five saying they need different opening hours.\u0026nbsp  More than one in ten Scots now expect hospitality services to be available 24-hours, and may be disappointed if they aren\u0027t.\u0026nbsp  The study concluded that by responding to this demand, Scotland\u0026rsquos restaurants could benefit by \u0026pound126m each year, takeaways by \u0026pound144m, and pubs, bars and clubs could benefit the most by accessing a market worth almost \u0026pound100 million each.  One sector identified to be rising to the challenge of changing work patterns the country\u0027s gyms, with some allowing PIN-controlled access systems, smart lighting, temperature controls and extensive video monitoring to overcome the staffing issues that deter some businesses from after-hours opening.\u0026nbsp    Mr Grant added: \u0026ldquoThe current leisure environment does present a number of challenges for the sector\u0026rsquos businesses the labour supply is challenged by Brexit, rent increases and food inflation are all set within the context of an incredibly competitive market which is already heavily discounting. \u0026nbsp  \"However, those that don\u0026rsquot adapt to this type of newly developing consumer demand risk being left behind and in this ever-competitive environment, businesses need to weigh up the value of the long-term opportunity over the cost of the short-term investment.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Parents and teachers blamed for  obsession  with university education","story":"              PARENTS and teachers pressurise pupils to go to university without knowing whether it is the best option for them, a leading industrialist has claimed.  Sir Ian Wood, the former Wood Group chief executive and philanthropist, said the pervasive culture that higher education was \"the be all and end all\" was damaging to the large proportion of pupils who were not academically minded.  And he called for a greater focus on the importance of vocational qualifications - as well as a campaign to highlight successful and lucrative careers outside the traditional professions.  Sir Ian was giving evidence to the Scottish Parliament\u0027s education committee, which is looking at the options available to pupils when they leave school.  He said: \"There is a real cultural thing about university being the be all and end all and therefore anything that is not university frankly tends to get secondary consideration. Parents are at fault, teachers are at fault, some schools are at fault.  \"We are trying to change a long embedded view that somehow the really worthwhile thing in life is to go to university and so many parents have got that as the aspiration for the youngster.  \"Parents are the root of the problem, but teachers are the next stage up because a lot of teachers believe that their success is based on how many Highers their children get.\"  Sir Ian told the committee apprenticeships and trades occupations should be made more respectable and highlighted the fact many pupils who had a technical education earned higher salaries than those who went to university.  He added: \"Because of the culture issue a lot of people go to university because their parents want them to go to university ... but they come out and they are still not sure what they want to do and the qualification hasn\u0027t really helped them an awful lot.\"  Joanna Murphy, chairwoman of the National Parent Forum of Scotland, said pupils could be \"negatively influenced\" by parents, but this was often due to a lack of understanding of the alternative opportunities.  She said: \"Although career opportunities are being highlighted more frequently in schools, particularly the promotion of apprenticeships, this tends to be focused in fifth and sixth year which is far too late for parents.\"  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect Scotland, said many parents got the message \"loud and clear\" from schools that university was the desirable next step.  She said: \"Since it is well recognised that most parents receive their information about education from their child\u0026rsquos school we can\u0026rsquot be surprised at the result.  \"Parents tell us that they feel they receive little information about diverse routes both in and after school, and they often feel frustrated that their child is being ignored in a system which focusses on higher education if their child is not academically minded.  \"Some parents have a clear vision of what they want for their child based on their experience and often family tradition and it is up to schools to help families and young people see the value of wider approaches.\"  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, said it was not teachers, but the Scottish Government and schools quango Education Scotland who \"obsessed\" about the number of Higher passes. And he also argued business had \"raised the stakes\" by making more jobs degree level entry only.  He said: \"I think teachers will bridle at his dismissal of their efforts to encourage vocational pathways. We have been arguing constantly that senior school has been overly focused on qualifications for the past four years.\"  A spokesman for Universities Scotland said: \"We have been absolutely clear that we need to a conversation about getting parents and schools to recognise that the best outcome for young people is the outcome that allows the young person to fulfil their potential.  \"We are also clear that for many people university is the right option for them later in life and we need diverse routes to success for diverse individuals.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Glasgow  is clogged with roads  traffic and pollution ","story":"              It is universally known as the Dear Green Place due to the number of parks and open spaces where the residents could enjoy some leisure time.

A key problem, according to the report, is Glasgow\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquogrid system layout which it says hands significantly more space over to roads than other UK cities, despite it having one of the lowest car ownership levels.  Some 25 per cent of land in the city centre is covered by roads, while pavements take up just eight per cent.  In Edinburgh, however, there is a more equal balance, with roads using just 12% of space, while pavements have 10%.  The commission\u0026rsquos report also points to a rise in goods vehicles \u0026ndash such as home delivery services \u0026ndash and private-hire taxis which could be adding to congestion problems.  The independent commission was established by Glasgow Council leader Susan Aitken with a remit to rethink the city centre as a business, retail and leisure destination.  It is spearheaded by former government transport adviser Professor David Begg.  He said: \u0026ldquoA generation ago Glasgow  led the way across the UK towards  what was seen as a modernised transport system built for the car.  \u0026ldquoNow, with rapidly changing demands and a trend towards low-carbon infrastructure, the priorities of people have changed quite dramatically.  \u0026ldquoThe dominance of the road is being questioned not only in social terms  with its negative impact on air quality and road safety, but also economically as its rival European cities transform their environments in favour of pedestrians, cyclists and integrated public transport.  It pointed to a dramatic decline in bus use which has seen passenger numbers slump by 40% in the past decade. In the past four years, First Bus has lost 27 million passengers \u0026ndash a markedly worse decline than any other UK city.  Despite the introduction of cycle lanes and better walkways, evidence to the commission from SPT had shown  journeys by bike had increased by 3%  in the decade to 2016, and the proportion of journeys on foot had fallen from  15% to 11%.  The findings pointed to research that showed large increases in city-centre employment in Manchester and Leeds occurring at the same time as a population boom. Many new residents were young professionals attracted by job prospects and amenities.  Ms Aitken said: \u0026ldquoDavid Begg\u0026rsquos expertise and knowledge speaks for itself. I gave him and his commissioners a very broad remit \u0026ndash linked to improving the city centre experience supporting the local economy, and ensuring all of Glasgow\u0026rsquos people can share in the prosperity it creates.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom pleased to see them really take that challenge on and it is clear the commission has already gathered some very significant and sometimes uncomfortable evidence.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to try to second-guess what their final recommendations are going to be, but I\u0026rsquom convinced they will present a healthy challenge to the city and to members of all parties on the council.  The commission will produce its final report and recommendations in November."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7922625.jpg?type=article-full","title":"  Get into the summer spirit with these great Scottish gins","story":"              SCOTLAND\u0027S\u0026nbsplove of gin continues to evolve in new and interesting ways.  The juniper berry based spirit is being developed across the country with many craft distilleries popping up offering a new twist on the refreshing and versatile drink. Gin makes the ideal summer drink no matter the setting.  Below we have listed some of the finest concoctions of Scottish gins currently on the market\u0026hellip  Verdant Dry Gin  As winners of the Scottish Gin of the Year Award, their full flavour, no fuss approach, has gained Verdant Dry Gin widespread acclaim. Smooth and sophisticated, it has gained wide appeal thanks to its classic taste and style. Distilled in small batches from the highest quality ingredients in a 500 litre pot still named \u0026ldquoLittle Eddie after the old jute mill where it is made, Verdant Gin is the first and only gin distilled in Dundee. \u0027    Juniper-led, the spirit displays fresh notes of citrus from Spain, coriander from India balanced with warm, earthy undertones of spice. This carefully curated blend of botanicals was inspired by Dundee\u0026rsquos rich trading history and reflects the routes once sailed by traders to and from the city.  At just over a year old, the spirit is already packing a punch in the world of Scottish gins, beating off some stiff competition. Seeking to produce a modern yet classic gin, they have successfully created a rounded spirit with that can be enjoyed on its own, with tonic or in a cocktail.    They recommend Verdant Gin be served neat (on the rocks or not) or as a G\u0026ampT with your favourite tonic. Bottled at 43% ABV, it also has plenty of character to hold its own when used in the skilled mixologist\u0026rsquos hands, adding depth and vitality to new and traditional cocktail creations.

The still was made locally in Elgin by highly skilled craftsmen who carefully shaped copper sheets into a traditional 250l copper still making the micro-distillery one of the smallest in the region.    Gin enthusiasts will be given a rare insight into this Elgin based distillery as they open their doors with an upcoming special two day event. On Saturday 7 and Sunday 8 July, you will have the chance to join a small group for an intimate tour of the facility. During the open days you can taste their popular range of Avva Scottish Gins, along with their sister brand Berry Good Liqueurs.  Avva Scottish Gin was launched in 2016, with strong links to surrounding Elgin. The ethos behind the company is history, provenance and family, made evident through the personal details all intrinsically linked to the name, the design, the still, botanical selection, the Speyside region and the distillers\u0026rsquo family.    Jill Brown, the founder and owner of Moray Distillery, said: \u0026ldquoThe distillery is not normally open to the public, so we\u0026rsquore excited to host another open day. It\u0026rsquos a great activity for people to experience around the area, and something a little different, especially for anyone looking to have a day out and explore Elgin.  \u0026ldquoIt was important for us to create a product with links to our history and culture. Our still is called Jessie Jean- named after both my grandmothers, and Avva actually means respected grandmother. The \u0026lsquorose window\u0026rsquo design on each bottle was created to represent what it was thought the Elgin Cathedral window looked like.  \u0026ldquoThe feedback we\u0026rsquove had since the launch has been immense\u0026hellip I\u0026rsquom really proud of our gin.

As trains pass overhead on their way south from Glasgow Central station, Darran is busy distilling Illicit Gin using traditional methods. Botanicals infuse in a\u0026nbsp copper pot still over a naked flame, the process is truly small batch and each bottle is hand-filled and labelled on site.    With their first product launching in April this year Illicit Gin aims to take gin back to its roots, the way gin should be \u0026ndash with juniper firmly at the forefront. Other botanicals including liquorice, clove, cinnamon and nutmeg \u0026ndash which contribute a sweet, earthy flavour \u0026ndash along with perfumed notes from the likes of cardamom and orange and lemon peels provide citrus freshness.  The short, squat nature of the still used at Illicit Spirits helps produce spirits which are full-bodied, flavourful in character, and rich in texture. A spirit of this kind deserves to be enjoyed simply, neat over ice, or served with a premium tonic, slice of orange peel and a bruised cardamom pod.    \u0026nbspIllicit Gin is currently stocked in a small selection of independent bars and off-licences throughout Glasgow and beyond, and will be moving into UK-wide distribution later in the year.  en-gb.facebook/illicitspiritsco  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Isle of Skye Distillers  Isle of Skye Distillers\u0026rsquo story began in 2016, when brothers Alistair and Thomas Wilson combined their experience in the hospitality and construction industries and completed their vision: to build the first gin distillery on the Isle of Skye.    At Isle of Skye Distillers, provenance is everything. The distillery is proud to use locally foraged juniper berries and clear spring water from the Storr Lochs to create their small-batch spirits: Misty Isle Gin, and Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin, both infused with a true taste of Skye. Every part of the production process is carried out at the distillery in Portree, right down to hand-numbering and signing each bottle.  Alongside these locally grown juniper berries, Misty Isle Gin is distilled with a precise balance of botanicals, including coriander, grains of paradise, orris root, liquorice root, black cubebs, angelica root, lemon peel, lemon verbena, cassia bark, and another secret ingredient, which can only be found at high altitude on the Isle of Skye. Still crafted according to the original recipe first developed by Thomas and Alistair during the distillery\u0026rsquos creation, Misty Isle Gin is juniper-heavy with earthy undertones, a hint of spice, and best enjoyed with a Scottish tonic water and a twist of orange peel.  Distilled alongside Misty Isle Gin is Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin, which was created in memory of Alistair and Thomas\u0026rsquo late father, Tommy Wilson, who served in the Suez invasion. \u0026lsquoTommy\u0026rsquo is also a generic name and term of endearment for a soldier. For every bottle of Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin sold, a donation is made to local military charities.    Crafted with botanicals including poppy seed, coriander, liquorice root, blaeberry and sweet orange, Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin is best served with fresh Scottish blaeberries and garnished with a twist of lemon peel.  Pick up a bottle of Misty Isle Gin (RRP \u0026pound34) or Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin (RRP \u0026pound39.95) from Isle of Skye Distillers\u0026rsquo shop in Portree, from an independent spirits retailer, or order a bottle online.\u0026nbsp  For more information, a full list of stockists and to browse the distillery\u0026rsquos online shop, please visit www.isleofskyedistillers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  McQueen Gin  Dale and Vicky McQueen, a husband and wife with a passion for gin and adventure, decided to embark on the McQueen Gin journey in 2015 after leaving their careers as a mechanical engineer and master baker and chef respectively. In the work they do (and have done!), Dale and Vicky have always focused on creating the purest, best possible standard of end product. The precision of an engineer and the taste of perfection from a master baker and chef made the perfect blend for the development of this award winning gin brand.    McQueen Gin is a true craft spirit gin brand, which shares Dale and Vicky\u0026rsquos taste of adventure. They are fulfilling their dream by creating a product made using the purest and most authentic of methods and sharing it with the increasing population of gin lovers. The McQueen gins are infused with natural notes of hand-selected botanicals during distillation, with no flavour elements added after it leaves their much-loved still named \u0026lsquoLittle Maggie\u0026rsquo. This trademark distillation method means that each unique flavour is pure and perfectly balanced, allowing the adventurous gin drinker an experience that is absolutely unrivalled.    Based at their much-loved distillery in Callander, Scotland they introduced true craft spirits with flavour profiles such as smokey chilli, mocha, mint chocolate and sweet citrus, with something for every occasion and flavour profiles that true craft gin drinkers can\u0026rsquot wait to try. The strong belief in their philosophy of bringing customers a taste of adventure and discovery, married with their unique distillation method, is what makes the product so unique. Craft gin drinkers increasingly want provenance and true hand-crafted products, something McQueen ensures. When developing the product, the team spent 6 months working on over 100 iterations to develop the initial product range which was a world first at the time.  At McQueen Gin, they continue to explore new innovative methods to ensure that their pure and exciting products deliver on all levels. This includes the imminent introduction of a stylish new glass version of their award-winning ceramic bottle and the build of a new and improved distillery on their land in Callander, which has recently got underway.

Each of our spirits is characterised by our use of locally grown botanicals, including a variety of Norse Angelica brought to the islands by seafarers centuries ago. We grow these botanicals in partnership with the Orkney Agronomy Institute in Kirkwall, ensuring consistent quality throughout the harvest.  If you\u0026rsquove not already experienced our gins, please allow us to share the highlights.  Firstly, we have our acclaimed Norse inspired signature gin, Kirkjuvagr, evoking the freshness of the Orkney seas and the purity of our island environment.  For the bold, we offer a 57% ABV, Storm Strength Arkh-Angell gin, which adds new depths to the renowned flavour profile of its elder spirit.  And, finally, we have our newest release, Harpa, a light and fruity gin that takes Kirkjuvagr\u0026rsquos character in a new direction for the long days of summer.  It\u0026rsquos a range that offers something for all occasions and every season.  This summer sees Orkney Distilling move to a permanent new home on the shores of Kirkwall Bay, representing the latest chapter in our saga.                         .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default .vjs-tech { position: static !important }                       .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default { height: auto !important width: 100% !important}                       .vjs-playlist-description { display: none }                       .vjs-big-play-button { top: 0pxleft: 0pxright: 0pxbottom: 0pxmargin: auto }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist { background-color: #f7f4f1color: #000min-width: auto }                       .vjs-playlist cite { overflow: initialtext-overflow: initialwhite-space: initialfont-weight: 600font-size: 16px }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist time { color: #fff }                       cite.vjs-playlist-name { text-align: left }                       .story-credits { margin-top: 20px }                       #liveMultiHide .vjs-dock-description { display: none }                       .vjs-playlist-thumbnail { margin-right: 10px !IMPORTANT }                        /* Style the overlay */                        /* Hide the overlay */                        .hide-countdown {                            display: none                        }                        .hide-overlay {                            display: none                        }                        /* Style the overlay */                        .vjs-overlay,                        .vjs-overlay.vjs-overlay-top {                            position: absolute                            top: 0px                            left: 0px                        }                        .vjs-overlay p {                            width: 100px                            background-color: #000000                            color: #fff                            padding: 10px                            margin: 0                            margin-bottom: 0                            border-radius: 0px                            text-align: left                        }                                               width=\"100%\"                            data-account=\"64298557001\"                            data-player=\"rkgvgWjWCG\"                            data-embed=\"default\"                            data-video-id=\"5797498382001\"                            class=\"video-js\"                            playsinline                            data-random-id=\"721790244\"                            controls  We\u0026rsquove approached the creation of our new distillery and visitor centre with the same attention to detail that we apply to our gin production.

One of the few craft distilleries to be awarded brown sign status, it has been publicly recognised as a star-rated destination on the Scottish tourist map.  The stables-turned-distillery \u0026ndash which was voted Most Promising New Business at the Perthshire Chamber of Commerce Star Awards \u0026ndash is where Persie gin is hand-crafted in small batches. There are three richly aromatic expressions: Zesty Citrus Herby and Sweet \u0026amp Nutty Old Tom.    The three expressions were developed by the man behind Scotland\u0026rsquos first touring gin enterprise. Founded in 2013, Gin Club Scotland was launched with the sole purpose of hearing the voice of the customer and using these insights to make a home-grown Scottish gin that hit the spot. It worked like a charm: in under a year, Simon Fairclough had visited every Scottish region and heard from over 2,000 gin-lovers about what appealed to their taste buds, pocket and sense of style. He harvested this feedback and found out two things. Firstly, for cracking gin, you need more than a nice taste: you need aroma. With over 75% of flavour down to smell, the perfect interplay of aroma and taste is the single biggest influence among Scots for liking each gin. And, secondly, three profiles proved most popular at tastings by a wide margin \u0026ndash fruity, savoury and sweet.    The result is that Persie Gin taps right into that \u0026ndash with a family of three distinct styles of aromatic gin. Each gin is made with carefully chosen botanicals to evoke an emotive and comforting scent: Zesty Citrus is sharply fruity, chock-full of limes and oranges Herby \u0026amp Aromatic is dry and savoury, with fragrant rosemary and basil and Sweet \u0026amp Nutty is full-bodied and creamy,\u0026nbspwith fresh\u0026nbspvanilla pods, almonds and a hint of root ginger.  All three gins scooped awards in the first year of trading. Zesty Citrus was voted Best Gin in Scotland Under \u0026pound35 by Scottish Field magazine Herby \u0026amp Aromatic was awarded a Silver Outstanding for Gin \u0026amp Tonic by the International Wine \u0026amp Spirits Competition and Sweet \u0026amp Nutty Old Tom was awarded a Silver Medal in the Speciality Gin category at the Scottish Gin Awards.  The distillery is open to the public for drop-ins, tours and tastings.  www.persiedistillery  snifter@persiedistillery  @persiegin  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Porter\u0027s Gin  Founders Ben, Josh and Alex turned the basement of their award winning Aberdeen cocktail bar, Orchid, into a micro-distillery. They focus on modern gin recipes that pay respect to tradition.\u0026nbsp      The result is a modern classic gin with a punchy juniper and a unique citrus flavour profile. The fresh, light and clean flavour from the cold-distilled botanicals make this a perfect gin for long refreshing summer drinks.

The expansive ocean surrounding the beautiful Isle of Barra has inspired the island-born couple\u0026rsquos adventure into the world of distilling.    With many goals set for the future of the Isle of Barra Distillers, it is the deep sense of duty that drives the team on. With a firm belief of giving something back to the community and at the same time building something that will one day outlive anyone that walks through the doors.  Michael feels that \u0026ldquoabove everything else that we can achieve from this journey, it is the thought of both giving something back to this beautiful island and also putting the Isle of Barra on the \u0026lsquogin map\u0026rsquo that drives us forward. We feel we owe it to the island and its people - we have the opportunity to do something great and something great is what we are going to do.    The key botanical in Barra gin is sourced naturally from the crystal clear, pure shallows that surround the remotre isle of Barra.  Every piece of edible carrageen seaweed is meticulously selected and handpicked by us on Barra\u0027s beautiful beaches to provide the distinctive flavour of our unique gin.  The carrageen, also known by its scientific name Chondrus Crispus, is a species of red algae native to the cool Atlantic waters skirting Europe\u0026rsquos rocky coastlines, including our beautiful Isle of Barra. Like many of the other seaweed varieties found on the Scottish coast, carrageen is harvested after the spring tides, when the water is furthest from the shore.  It\u0026rsquos this passion and belief that must surely make the story of the Isle of Barra Distillers one to remember.  www.isleofbarradistillers\u0026nbsp  www.facebook/barradistillers  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Teasmith Gin  The Teasmith Gin creators Nick and Emma Smalley have created something truly special - the first Scottish Gin distilled with hand-picked tea. \u0026nbspWhy? Because Scotland has many historical links with the tea trade with several stemming from Aberdeenshire which is where the Founders are based. \u0026nbsp    When they discovered the story of James Taylor \u0026ndash a young man from the area - who grew the very first commercial tea plantation in British Ceylon, they worked with tea consultant Beverly Wainwright to source a special loose leaf tea from the Amba Estate in Sri Lanka.\u0026nbsp It is both hand-picked and hand-rolled \u0026ndash much in the same way Taylor produced his first batches 150 years ago on the island. \u0026nbsp  When distilled, the tea provides fabulous citrus notes of blood orange along with a minty sweetness. \u0026nbspThese flavours are paired with more classic gin botanicals such as juniper, coriander seed, dried orange peel, angelica and orris root and a sprinkle of rose petals to create a smooth and fresh juniper-led gin with a citrusy lingering sweetness\u0026nbsp  Finalists in three categories at the 2017 Scottish Gin Awards and racking up 5 awards for brand design already, this gin doesn\u0026rsquot disappoint. A truly smooth gin packaged in a beautifully simple bottle with lots of hidden hand-finishes \u0026ndash it ticks all the boxes.    Serve this gin with copious ice, a premium quality tonic and sprig of fresh mint for a truly crisp and refreshing G\u0026ampT. \u0026nbspOr as a cocktail suggestion, The Teasmith Southside is a really simple drink that you can make at home.  The Teasmith Gin is available through The Teasmith Gin\u0026rsquos website for \u0026pound38.95 or through the Master of Malt. \u0026nbspAvailable in store at Valhalla\u0026rsquos Goat (Glasgow) and The Gin Company (Edinburgh) and many other stockists listed on their website.

The development and refinement of the gin began when Cameron took it upon himself to install in the family kitchen a micro still named Jinty\u0027. He then spent six months distilling and experimenting with around 60 different botanicals in various forms.    The McCann\u0027s then enlisted the help of several Stirling residents / gin enthusiasts by creating a tasting panel whom tested and validated the gin.  The final six botanicals used today Juniper, Angelica, Lemon Peel, Orange Peel and the most unique being fresh hand-picked Stirlingshire Nettles and Basil which give an amazing clean green fresh flavour allowing you to sip Stirling Gin straight over ice or as a classic G\u0026ampT with a garnish of orange zest \u0026amp basil.  It also lends itself very well in numerous cocktails, especially the \u0027Bloody Scotland\u0027.  Since it went into full production Stirling Gin has gone from strength to strength, with it being listed across the the UK in specialist independent shops, bars \u0026amp restaurants. It\u0027s now listed with all major wholesalers.    Not wanting to sit back Stirling Gin is certainly putting Stirling on the Gin map with the impending purchase of a building at the top of Stirling near the historic Castle. This will operate as a distillery and visitor centre.

MSPs looked up cursorily at the delegation in headphones next to the translator\u0026rsquos box.  Tory leader Ruth Davidson started moaning ritually about lags with tags. The SNP was planning \u0026ldquoto release more criminals back into communities, she said, and didn\u0026rsquot care if the blighters cut off their curfew anklets.  \u0026ldquoI certainly hope that the parliamentary authorities allow more than 15 minutes debate for those important issues, she quipped.  So far, so standard. The next 40 minutes stretched agonisingly over the horizon.  And then Richard Leonard showed us just what he\u0026rsquos made of. It was extraordinary. It was a revelation. It was truly the Scottish Labour leader at the peak of his powers  \u0026ldquoCan the First Minister give us another word for a hummingbird\u0026rsquos beak? he asked.  Now, you\u0026rsquore probably thinking I just made that up. But no. I\u0026rsquom a journalist not a surrealist.  \u0026ldquoEh, not immediately, no, replied the First Minister warily, groping for the security alarm under her desk.  The chamber fell silent. The tension crackled. The Ukrainian delegation stirred nervously. Hearts went out to the bloke in the translator\u0026rsquos box tasked with conveying that one to the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada.  \u0026lsquoComrade Sturgeon, please to describe the mouth of a tiny chicken,\u0026rsquo he whimpered.  Mr Leonard said the FM\u0026rsquos reply was \u0026ldquounfortunate as the fabled \u0026ldquohummingbird\u0026rsquos beak question was one of the government\u0026rsquos standardised test posers for five-year-olds.  \u0026ldquoLittle wonder that Scotland\u0026rsquos teachers have told me how young and confident children are crushed by these tests, he said, miming the crushing of a five-year-old in a car compactor.  \u0026ldquoThere have been reports of children being driven to tears! he went on. \u0026ldquoTears!  One educational charity had even likened the tests to a traumatic \u0026ldquoadverse childhood experience, he said, conjuring up the image of a hummingbird silhouette slashing at a shower curtain with its hooter.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know what Richard Leonard was doing yesterday, sneered Ms Sturgeon in a tone strongly suggesting she thought it involved concussion.  \u0026ldquoBut I talked to a range of primary school children, including some five-year-olds. I did not meet any who were in tears or see any who looked crushed. I saw confident, bright and enthusiastic young people.  Beaky Leonard reckoned that sounded thoroughly improbable. Standardised tests were flawed and had to stop, he said.  \u0026ldquoFM, will you stop standardised testing for five-year-olds now and put pupils first?  Ms Sturgeon said she would always listen to feedback from teachers - but not Labour.  As for the answer to Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos question? He managed to cock even that up.  It later emerged the test is actually a multiple choice that runs: \u0026ldquoThe hummingbird has a thin beak. What is another word for beak?  Kids, crushed and otherwise, are then asked to choose between skin, bill and body.  Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos choices, meanwhile, appear destined to stay ridicule, failure and obscurity."},{"url":null,"title":"Thousands join SNP after party  39 s dramatic Westminster walk-out","story":"              THOUSANDS of new members have signed up to the SNP in the wake of the party\u0026rsquos dramatic Westminster walk-out.  Nationalist MPs stormed out of the Commons after their Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, was ordered to leave the chamber following a row with the Speaker.  Since then, the SNP said its membership has surged by 5,085 in just 24 hours \u0026ndash putting it on the cusp of being the second largest party in the UK, ahead of the Conservatives.  Deputy leader Keith Brown said the SNP was \u0026ldquothe only party standing up for Scotland and doing all we can to defend the powers of our Parliament.  Mr Blackford was ordered to leave during Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions after clashing with Commons Speaker John Bercow.  The SNP Westminster leader had accused the UK Government of plunging Scotland into a \u0026ldquoconstitutional crisis over its decision to push on with its Brexit Bill despite Holyrood withholding consent.  He attempted to use a parliamentary device by calling for an immediate vote on turning PMQs into a private session. But after repeatedly refusing to sit down, Mr Blackford was ordered to leave the Commons \u0026ndash with the rest of his party\u0026rsquos MPs quickly following suit.  Mr Brown said: \u0026ldquoThe Tories think they can do what they want to Scotland and get away with it, but Scotland has told the Tories loudly and clearly \u0026ndash hands off our parliament.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos no wonder people are joining the SNP in their droves \u0026ndash we are the only party standing up for Scotland and doing all we can to defend the powers of our Parliament. That is why 5,085 people have joined the party in the last 24 hours.  \u0026ldquoAs the SNP made clear at PMQs yesterday, this Tory power grab will not be tolerated and we will fight tooth and nail to defend the powers that are rightly held by Holyrood.  It is understood around 50-100 normally join or rejoin the SNP on any given day.  It comes as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned the Tories will pay \"a very, very heavy political price\" for their handling of the Brexit Bill.  Ms Sturgeon said Theresa May\u0027s party had effectively \"ripped up\" the convention underpinning devolution, and \"hoped that nobody would notice\".  Speaking at First Minister\u0027s Questions, she said events at Westminster this week were \"the most clear and powerful evidence so far\" that the system does not work for Scotland.  She addressed MSPs shortly after crowds gathered outside Holyrood to protest against what the SNP claims is a \"Westminster power grab\".  The party\u0027s MPs were left outraged on Tuesday evening when amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill affecting Scotland were passed after less than 20 minutes of debate, with the only speech being from Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.  Mr Blackford has warned the SNP will now take \"whatever action is necessary\" to press its case, and will work to \"frustrate\" Theresa May\u0027s administration."},{"url":null,"title":"Primary teachers   39 losing 70 hours a week  39  to new standardised testing","story":"              PRIMARY teachers are losing around two weeks-worth of classroom time trying to oversee new tests for five-year-olds, it has been claimed.  One teacher in Edinburgh said they had spent around 70 hours administering the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos standardised tests on their school\u0026rsquos 54 primary one pupils.  It comes as ministers came under increasing pressure to scrap the assessments amid claims some children have been reduced to tears.  In an email sent to Scottish Labour MSP Iain Gray, the Edinburgh primary teacher said they had overseen 30 hours of testing for numeracy and 40 for literacy.  They added: \u0026ldquoThe amount of progress that could have been delivered if those hours were used for effective teaching is significant and instead we were required to use that time to run testing which\u0026hellipis problematic in almost every regard.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the new tests last year as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  But critics insist testing pupils in the first year of primary \u0026ndash as well as in P4, P7 and S3 \u0026ndash piles too much pressure on children and teachers.  Raising the issue at First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said teachers had told him that young, confident children had been \u0026ldquocrushed by the assessments.  Calling for them to be scrapped, he said: \u0026ldquoAt SNP conference John Swinney claimed that we are seeing the start of a renaissance in Scottish education. This \u0026lsquorenaissance\u0026rsquo is driving primary school children to tears.  \u0026ldquoThese tests have been flawed from the very start. Delivered late, \u0026pound2 million over budget and have led to weeks of valuable teaching time lost.  In their email, the Edinburgh teacher \u0026ndash whose identity has been kept anonymous to protect their job \u0026ndash also raised a number of issues with the design and wording of the tests.  They wrote: \u0026ldquoMany of the questions in the tests are very poorly phrased \u0026ndash often at best they are ambiguous and at worst they are so badly written that they are actually misleading.  In one example, children were presented with the problem: \u0026ldquoJane had six grapes on her plate, she ate three of them, choose Jane\u0026rsquos plate.  The teacher said the phrasing of the question made it unclear whether pupils should choose the half-eaten plate, or the original.  They also noted that out of the 54 pupils tested, \u0026ldquonot one child came out as low on the numeracy test, even though some of them only gave a handful of correct answers.  They added: \u0026ldquoThe only conclusion I can reach having watched this process from beginning to end is that these tests have been set up to give a deliberately vague picture which broadly supports the idea that the attainment gap is closing.  \u0026ldquoI cannot use the data from these tests to support my teaching in any way. It does not provide reliable information on any aspect of my children\u0026rsquos learning or development.  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teaching union, said many of the concerns raised by the teacher had also been brought up by other members.  He said primary teachers faced a logistical challenge as they administered the tests, which require pupils to have access to computers.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe had people at the [latest] conference talking about children being distressed."},{"url":null,"title":"animal welfare charity welcomes new addition","story":"\t\tA foal has been born at the Scottish SPCA\u0027s Aberdeen Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre.\t\t\t\tScotland’s animal welfare charity welcomed the healthy colt into the world at 7.30am yesterday (Tuesday, June 12).
