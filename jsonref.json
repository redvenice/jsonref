Reflecting on the year, Lisa said she\u0027s glad she did it but \u0027it\u0027s really, really hard work.\u0027\u0027Balancing jobs on top of it all was stressful and we couldn\u0027t do it permanently,\u0027 Lisa said. She also says that more pressure should be put on businesses to reduce their waste instead of putting all the onus on iniduals to make these changes.She added: \u0027We can\u0027t do it by ourselves - it has to be done on a much larger scale with more companies looking at their waste. For us it\u0027s taught us so much about how much waste we use and how much small things can build up.\u0027Lisa says she would recommend anyone to do it, even if it\u0027s not for a year.\u0027Even if it\u0027s just for a month or two, it can really make a difference,\u0027 said Lisa. But she added: \u0027It\u0027s important not to feel guilty about buying packaged foods - everyone has different circumstances and you just do what you can, really. If everyone just does what they can manage, that\u0027s all you can ask.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Driver gets SUV stuck barriers middle M3 rush hour","story":"Share this article The shocked music teacher, from Southampton, Hampshire, was travelling home from work when she noticed the vehicle on the southern section of the M3 where it splits into the M27. She added: \u0027I can only imagine he tried to change lanes late or was forced over and ended up mounting the central barrier at the point where it originally rose from the ground.          The motorist is left stranded on central reservation in their black Toyota Rav 4 along the motorway         Bemused drivers pass by as the driver is left stick in the car almost a metre off the ground near Eastleigh, Hampshire\u0027He must have travelled some distance along it.

Mnuchin, though, disputes whether green measures can really be priced.We don’t know how to price the risk of climate change, so we’re over-estimating the cost, he claims.If you want to introduce a carbon tax, then “go ahead” adds the Treasury secretary, adding that a carbon tax is “a tax on hard-working people”.The panel moves onto climate... and Steve Mnuchin says it is only one of several important issues.He cites health (topical, given the coronavirus crisis) and the Middle East -- Iran can’t be allowed to get a nuclear weapon, he insists.Mnuchin says Donald Trump does care about clean air and water. He left the Paris Agreement because he felt it wasn’t fair.There’s way too many people in the developing world who do not have access to electricity.As much as we want to talk about the environmental issues ...we need to work very hard to create an environment for these people where they have better lives.Germany’s finance minister, Olaf Scholz, tells Davos that his country won’t take an economic hit from Brexit.It will be harder for the UK, though, Scholz warns -- warning that the City of London will be less important after Brexit.It will still be important, but the situation will be different, he says.Speaking on today’s panel on the global economic outlook, Scholz warns that a country simply cannot have all the advantages of being a member of the EU while also enjoying the advantage of being outside as well.I think we will find solutions, Scholz continues, but he adds that there might not be a “special, competitive advantage of being outside” the EU.On trade, Steve Mnuchin says the UK will be at the top of the list for a free trade deal, after Brexit.Asked about the United States’ trade deal plan this year, the Treasury Secretary:We’ve already started the conversions with the EU. We look forward to making progress with them.On the UK, the president has been clear going back to the election that the UK is our number one ally and will be at the top of the list of trade agreements.We look forward to getting that done this year.We’re encouraged. We know they also have to get a deal with the EU.ECB chief Christine Lagarde fears that Europe faces a Brexit “cliff edge” at the end of this year.She tells Davos that there some positive signs surrounding the global economy - with employment very low, and trade tensions easing.But the negotiations over Britain’s future relationship with the EU is a concern.Brexit is a little bit less uncertain, but we still have that possible cliff edge in December of 2020.We don’t’ know exactly what the trade relationship will be.And it’s a big partner for the euro area, so that’s certainly a question mark.Earlier this week, UK chancellor Sajid Javid told the World Economic Forum that a comprehensive deal can be reached by December.But it’s going to be tough. Yesterday, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte told Ed Conway of Sky News it was a 50:50 chance.....US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who took that nasty potshot at Thunberg yesterday, has told Davos that US government spending needs to be reined in.We look at a very robust economic outcome through 2020, Mnuchin predicted.He’s sitting alongside Zhu Min, Olaf Scholz, Kristalina Georgieva, Haruhiko Kuroda, and Christine Lagarde here at WEF.Mnuchin adds that “fiscal policy has worked”, and predicts that Donald Trump’s tax cuts will pay for themselves over 10 years (some economists disagree about this, but we’ll see).But looking ahead, Mnuchin says “we need to slow down the rate of growth of government spending, and lower it as a ratio basis.”That might worry Americans who depend on welfare, for example.Back in the Davos congress hall, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva is talking about the global economy.We are in a better place in January 2020 than we were in October 2019.The IM wants to see more aggressive fiscal policy, and structural reforms to create dynamism.Greta Thunberg, and her fellow activists are now going to march down the icy pavements of Davos, to conduct their regular School Strike for the climate emergency.That will allow them to lobby Davos delegates as they leave WEF and head for the railway station (although the global elite typically travel by chauffeur-driven cars).Luisa Neubauer says there is “less climate denial, but more climate action denial.” (hardly progress!)There is no point waiting for the crisis to come up before acting - the crisis is here now.Neubauer reiterates that she met with Siemens CEO Joe Kaiser at Davos this week, to pressure him to ditch the Adani coalmine contract (to provide rail signalling technology).We had a very good discussion here at Davos, so the dialogue is still going on.She then urges all investors, and all companies responsible for making fossil fuel projects, to heed the crisis.Our message to Joe Kaiser, and other business leaders, is that if you add up all the contracts that have been signed today on fossil fuel projects, we will be far beyond keeping temperature rises below two degrees C, she says.Some, or all, of those projects need to be cancelled if we are to achieve the Paris Agreement goals.This is not a radical demand, this is a rational demand.Vanessa Nakate says she believes the leaders at Davos have heard the message from climate activists - but they’re choosing to ignore it.Nakate also explains how social media has helped the climate activist movement -- by letting her get her message out across Uganda.Climate activists will continue to lobby Siemens over its involvement in the Adani coalmine in Australia, says Luisa Neubauer.Neubauer says activists have met with Siemens CEO Joe Kaiser, and explained why the mine will threaten any hopes of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees.We plan to speak at the Siemens AGM in February, Neubauer says.Kaiser has written about the struggle he had about whether to pull out of the project, before deciding not to (a good example of the problem)Q: How do you move the Davos community on, to a low-carbon future?Isabelle Axelsson says it shouldn’t be up to the climate activists to find the solutions.Politicians need to listen to the science, get a plan down on paper, and implement it, she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f50177628f1fb2744cb20bf3191e43297b752ef6/0_220_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=073e395a0fcfffbd32cc0188da0116a3","title":"apple dongles eu electronic waste pollution","story":"About 50m metric tons of e-waste are generated annually. But Apple says efforts to regulate mobile devices to reduce waste stifle ‘innovation’Do all cables matter?I found myself asking this deeply cursed question as I read a report commissioned by Apple on the European Commission’s plan to require mobile device makers to adopt a standard charger. The report runs 92-pages, features a cover photo of the three types of charging ports (USB-C, Micro-USB, and Lightning) nestled lovingly together like mama, papa and baby bear, and is titled United in Diversity.Reader, I choked.Apple’s current dedication to a ersity of dongles follows a renewed effort by the EU to enact regulations requiring all mobile devices to use a common charger. Standardizing charging cords would reduce waste and be consumer friendly, proponents of the regulations argue.This isn’t the EU’s first run at the problem: in 2009, phone companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) committing to working toward a common charger under threat of regulation from the European Commission. Most companies followed through, reducing the number of chargers in the non-Apple market from more than 30 to just two. But Apple used a loophole in the MOU to forge its own path, introducing the Lightning cord in 2012 and complying with the agreement by also producing (another) adaptor.“We are drowning in an ocean of electronic waste,” the Polish MEP Róża Thun und Hohenstein argued before the European Parliament last week. Approximately 50m metric tons of e-waste are generated annually, including 16.6kg per European, according to the Global E-waste Monitor. Apple responded to the EU on Thursday, arguing that the proposed regulation “stifles innovation rather than encouraging it”. “Legislation would have a direct negative impact by disrupting the hundreds of millions of active devices and accessories used by our European customers … creating an unprecedented volume of electronic waste and greatly inconveniencing users,” the company said in a statement.The United in Diversity report argues further that the environmental benefits of a common charger are relatively small – €13m compared to €1.5bn in “innovation harm”.I for one would like to see some ersity in the bad faith arguments that trillion dollar companies come up with as excuses for customer- and environment-unfriendly choices. Innovation just isn’t what it used to be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bca19f62dd501ef57a39ff0f67b928146508ad7f/0_50_1939_1163/master/1939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e561ca78c73adc693098d9c04e87b911","title":"brexit wetherspoons 31 january leave eu","story":"I’m not sure what I’ll be doing on 31 January, when the UK officially leaves the EU at midnight – Brussels time (just in case you thought things were going to be on our terms, now). Marching feels inappropriate and possibly dangerous. Spelling out an “SOS” that is visible from space would be logistically challenging. Maybe, as on the day after the referendum result, I’ll head to my local cheap and cheerful Italian for a Birra Moretti and some clam spaghetti and sit there, miserably, to a soundtrack of Andrea Bocelli like the filthy, sentimental remainer I am. Maybe I’ll get completely off my face. All I know is that I definitely won’t be in Wetherspoons, which is cutting its drinks prices to celebrate, in a campaign it is calling “Let’s stay friends”.In the past four years there hasn’t been a company that has championed Brexit more than Wetherspoons and its chairman, Tim Martin. The chain of pubs has produced millions of pro-Brexit beermats– prompting concerns about corporate governance – and a special Brexit-themed edition of Wetherspoons News. It has removed European beers from its menu, replaced Jägermeister with an English equivalent to create the “Brexit bomb”, and ditched champagne and prosecco in favour of English, New Zealand and Australian wines. I’ve drunk buckets of wine in Wetherspoons pubs – some of it from a tap – and honestly, it could have come from the lush vineyards of Scunthorpe for all I cared. Let’s just say that terroir was not my overriding concern in those days. And yet, it all rankles.I’ve fallen out of love with Wetherspoons, you see. Ours was a dirty love, all-consuming through my teenage years, then later underpinned by a fond nostalgia, as though for an ex who never left your hometown. I may have moved to London and become a bit gastro, but the appeal of a quick one never faded. It was cheap, and a bit filthy. It did the job. It felt like home.When I was in my mid-to-late teens there was an established routine. Our parents would drop us off in the car park round the back. There, we would consume a bottle of Aldi’s finest Badger’s Creek wine, before stashing the other bottle in our favoured shrub and heading inside, where everyone from school would be waiting. The Wetherspoons was in an old Catholic church. I have dim memories of going to see the priest there with a friend and her mother when I was very young: the spartan, dusty living quarters, the echoing emptiness of the place. When it became a pub it was full, jubilant. We sang our hymns at fever pitch and gave confession while nursing comically large fonts of sauv blanc. Repented upstairs in the loos, speaking to God down the big, white porcelain telephones.Later, when my brother moved to a care home, we’d take him out to Wetherspoons. He’d have fish and chips, or a burger. Sometimes he would hoot with excitement, and flap his hands – all symptoms of his autism. I was always struck by how no one batted an eyelid. Wetherspoons has seen it all. In fact, it was one of the few places where you’d often see people with disabilities. Lots of older people too, and people who clearly didn’t have much cash. Wetherspoons’ prices have kept it inclusive, like an informal community centre.I’ve always vociferously defended Wetherspoons against perceived snobbery, as when the Sunday Times restaurant critic Marina O’Loughlin ate in one for the first time in October 2017. She described the scampi, which my mum usually orders, as “stiff orange coffins emitting an ooze of vaguely fishy goo. Their peas somehow have a haunting backnote of fag ash” – she’s a brilliant writer. Yet I was irked by her review because it felt like she was implying something negative about my family and our tastes, our lack of money, possibly our class. As my husband says when MasterChef is on: “Chill out, it’s just a bit of dinner.” But in this country, it never is.I don’t think Marina was necessarily wrong about the food, and she certainly didn’t deserve the abuse that ensued. I’m curious as to why so many of us imbue a chain of cheapo pubs with such sentimental significance, to the point where even the carpets are fetishised. Wetherspoons seems to have become another front for a proxy culture war that’s about so much more than just Brexit. It’s infused with our ideas about social class and belonging, and who we ultimately are.Since the referendum, I haven’t felt like going in, much. It hasn’t been a conscious boycott unfortunately, it’s coincided with my brother struggling with public spaces. Unlike some remainers, I don’t have a list of Brexit-backing companies I refuse to do business with. But Martin’s rabidly pro-Brexit stance has alienated me, and it feels weird giving him my money. I still think Brexit is colossally stupid, and often underpinned by bigotry (it should be noted, by the by, that Martin says he is pro-immigration and in 2016 one in 10 Wetherspoons staff was from overseas). At the same time, I’ve done enough research into how the referendum has ided families, and spoken to enough Brexit voters, to know that isolating ourselves from the rest of society is not going to heal the deep isions in this country. You can’t escape where you are from, though at times I’ve tried. It’s true that I live in a bubble, surrounded by remainers. Yet I knew enough of my brother’s North Wales constituency to understand that it would switch from red to blue in the general election. To have seen the dying high street: Wetherspoons being one of the few thriving businesses.So, while I won’t be in there on the 31st, necking a Brexit bomb and singing Rule Britannia, it won’t be long, I’m sure, until I’m back in the Coronet on Holloway Road – a beautiful cinema with art nouveau ironwork – worshipping at the altar of cheap G\u0026ampT and trying, again, to love my neighbour, despite everything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ff9858790b0e8dcb45707d915d32b26329aef7d/0_203_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=560ddd6c666935a1a3ac16220bfb5495","title":"rising tide female gamblers help","story":"A couple of clicks to bet on the football: a win. Little did I know that in such a short space of time those clicks would lead me to losing my home and my job. I started gambling during a period of intense loneliness in my life. I was in an abusive relationship and my self-esteem was at an all-time low.My partner introduced me to online gambling in passing, sitting on the sofa one evening. It didn’t feel like a big deal, just something to do on your phone while the TV played in the background. I won the very first time I made a bet. It gave me an instant buzz – a feeling of gratification I think I had been missing in my life.This first win would come to shape the way I viewed gambling. It hooked me in, and I gradually spent more and more time over the following months chasing that initial high. Many others are like me, seeking a buzz that they don’t find in other places. For other women, it’s not a buzz but a numbness they seek from being in the gambling “bubble”. Gambling can sometimes be a reaction to depression or anxiety in other cases it may be a cause. More often than not, it’s the people who are already struggling who are most at risk of developing an addiction.Gambling was something I never sought out: I’d never been in a betting shop, casino or arcade. Instead, through apps on my smartphone, gambling came to me. My experience isn’t unique – more and more women who would never think to enter the all-male spaces of high-street bookies are finding themselves using online gambling sites and apps. Gambling online allowed my addiction to escalate. If you can hide the screen, you can hide the problem.It seemed as if by hitting a few buttons I could “make money”. This promised to become the answer to my debts – another issue I was struggling with at the time. I thought I could win millions and escape somewhere. But the more I chased this hope, the worse the problems I was trying to escape from became. The longer you gamble, the more you lose the more you lose, the more you gamble.The debts began to rack up – to the point that I lost not only my job but my home. That was when I reached rock bottom. The companies I was gambling with didn’t question where I was finding the money. I was never offered a deposit limit that would restrict the amount of money I could spend, self-exclusion for a period of time or support when I began to realise I was struggling with an addiction.I almost lost everything, including my life at my lowest point. As a woman, it somehow felt harder to ask for help: I worried I’d be judged for not being able to cope. Women are usually the ones who hold everything together, and I felt embarrassed that I wasn’t able to. Gambling addiction is still seen as an issue that only affects men. The reality is more and more women are gambling, and we need to raise awareness so they can access support. Specialist services available across the UK aren’t gender specific, they’re available to everyone and most importantly they’re provided for free.At the time, not knowing where to go, I reached out to my GP and was referred to GamCare. Through them I accessed therapy and support that helped me make positive changes to my life. I was able to view my situation from a different perspective, and to understand the aspects of my life that made gambling so attractive. I can now recognise what might trigger me to want to gamble, so I can make a healthier choice for me and my family.There is light at the end of the tunnel if we talk. Talk to one another, talk to your GP, talk to your therapist and talk to an adviser on the national gambling helpline. Rebuilding my life has been tough, but now I have a lovely home again, and I’m the happiest I’ve been in a long time.

South Africa’s Durban delivers 320 days of sunshine every year, as well as surfing, foodie adventures and sensational land and sea safariOnce seen as the quiet cousin of cosmopolitan Cape Town and fast-paced Johannesburg, the natural wonders and cultural charms of Durban and its surrounds put it firmly on South Africa’s must-see map. Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.The best place for a first-look at “Durbs” – as the locals call it – is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.Shimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world’s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.With miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa’s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade – try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf – will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.From May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde’s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn’t enough, you can often spot dolphins ing in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time’s environmental research.Oceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you’ll find a neat cross section of the city’s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha’s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.But when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don’t leave without braving the famous “bunny chow”: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You’ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (£4.19).It’s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It’s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.There’s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.A 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You’ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers’ market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa’s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views – of breaching whales and the ocean – but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there’s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.Another 30 minutes’ drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort’s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.South Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours’ drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.Or head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.So now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing’s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.How to bookWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The official UK government statement on the summit and a press release failed to mention these, citing only the far smaller support for clean energy. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said the “hypocrisy of the government’s position is breath-taking”.Johnson also announced that UK taxpayers’ money would no longer support overseas coal-fired power plants and coal mining. Yet MPs on the environmental select committee reported in 2019 that “UK Export Finance (UKEF) has not supported a coal project since 2002”. A report by Greenpeace and Newsnight also found that UKEF spent billions of pounds abroad supporting fossil fuel projects that will emit an estimated 69 million tonnes of carbon a year.The UK will host a critical UN climate summit in Glasgow in November, at which nations must dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions to avoid a disastrous 3o-4oC rise in global temperatures.Before the summit, Lucas asked ministers which companies would attend, but the Department of Trade refused to reveal the names, citing “commercial interests”.“Now we know why the government was so secretive,” said Lucas. “The hypocrisy of the government’s position is breathtaking. It boasts of its green credentials one minute, and then hosts an investment summit which sees billions being invested in carbon-intensive industries in Africa. This government’s promises on climate action are completely hollow.“As hosts of this year’s UN climate summit, the UK needs to show international leadership and bring other countries with us. We can’t do that while UK money and business is supporting dirty energy around the world.”At the summit, Johnson said the UK would help African nations “extract and use oil and gas in the cleanest, greenest way possible”, while also delivering “an electro-convulsive lightning bolt through our renewables industry”.Other deals struck at the summit included a total of £170m for aircraft and airports and £224m for a new Kenyan gold mine. The biggest deal was £3.2bn for Bombardier to construct and operate two monorail lines in Cairo, Egypt.The UK taxpayer is directly funding £50m of clean energy projects, including energy storage batteries and energy-efficient housing. “The government is stepping up our offer to work with African countries to unlock their massive renewable energy potential,” said the DIT spokesman.Nick Dearden, director of campaign group Global Justice Now, said: “The supposedly transformative £6.5bn UK investment in Africa includes oil, gas, gold mining and airlines. So much for fostering ‘climate-friendly’ development.“In the 19th century, the ‘scramble for Africa’ was carefully disguised as a humanitarian project. Now, 150 years later, what we saw at the UK-Africa summit was a desperate and unseemly grab for markets, dressed up as ‘development’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1a68aeceafded4e55b50249f7a56b81a4615525/0_11_800_480/master/800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e41eb309a23f74003ca95e2ff010751","title":"ants run secret farms on english oak trees photographer discovers","story":"Brown ants herd and milk giant pale aphids, building barns for them from beetle exoskeletonBritain has a new farmed animal, which is kept in barns, milked and moved between high and low pastures – but not by humans.The giant pale aphid, Stomaphis wojciechowskii, has lived undiscovered for thousands of years on English oak trees, where it has been looked after by brown ants.In return for plentiful supplies of honeydew – the sugary water excreted by the aphid – the ants herd the aphids, keeping them safe in “barns” they build on tree trunks from mosses, lichens and the exoskeletons of beetles.“It’s beautifully complex,” said Matt Shardlow, the chief executive of Buglife. “It is farming – they are milking the animals, moving them from high to low pastures and building shelters for them when there’s not enough protection.”The giant aphid – its lance-like mouth is up to twice as long as its 5-7mm body – has remained unnoticed for so long because it is mostly nocturnal and so well protected by the brown ant, Lasius brunneus.If the aphids are disturbed at one of their tree-trunk shelters, the ants immediately evacuate their “flock”, carrying the smallest iniduals in their jaws and hustling the larger aphids down to the ants’ underground shelters.The ants keep the aphids underground during severe weather. In summer, when the sap rises, the ants march the aphids up the tree trunk to ensure they are well-fed and can provide the ants with sweet honeydew.Britain has two other species of giant aphid but the giant pale aphid was not expected to be found here after it was identified as a new species in central and eastern Europe by mitochondrial DNA analysis in 2012.But photographer and naturalist Julian Hodgson spotted the unusual creature accompanied by several brown ant bodyguards while searching for barkflies in Monks Wood national nature reserve, an ancient woodland near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. Specimens were identified by entomologists in Poland and at the Natural History Museum.Stomaphis wojciechowskii has since been found at five other sites in north-west Cambridgeshire, including Woodwalton Fen and Holme Fen nature reserves.Further analysis suggests the giant aphid is not a new arrival but erged from its central European relatives 30,000 years ago.In the paper reporting its discovery in the British Journal of Entomology and Natural History, Hodgson and his co-authors said it was “short-sighted” that no aphid species had been given formal conservation status or protection in Britain.Shardlow said further work needed to be done to establish the giant aphid’s distribution but it was likely to be rare because the brown ant upon which it is completely dependent is “nationally notable”.“These types of giant aphid are all very special and are rarely seen,” said Shardlow. “Their life history is inspiring and we do need more people to study wild aphids so that we can understand which species are threatened and endangered.“Just because something is an aphid doesn’t mean it can’t be a conservation priority.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/406873aa6b0ee6d3a9725b48470cef51d2b4c932/708_86_2270_1362/master/2270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f8dbec49b5be33ce5fe4c0152d796f6","title":"come as your are cardigan returns to mens fashion fray","story":"Forget Mr Rodgers, the garment has left its clean-cut, geeky origins behind for a more ‘super chic realm’Hanks, playing the postwar children’s TV presenter Fred Rogers, wears a post box red cardigan, in a preppy cut. The cardigan became part of Rogers’ clean cut image, in the lineage of a certain type of family-friendly entertainer, such as Pat Boone or Val Doonican. With its layers of torso-concealing wool, the cardigan was never edgy. But that’s all changing.“The stigma surrounding cardigans has completely gone,” says Zak Maoui of GQ magazine. “In a similar vein to a socks and sandals combo, the cardigan has left its geek origins behind, moving instead to a super chic realm.”This “super chic” realm has been defined by Alessandro Michele, who has arguably helped modernise men’s style more than any other designer. In Milan a fortnight ago, he appeared after his Gucci show in an oversize, carrot coloured cardigan. But Michele had anointed the garment years before.The cardigan has been cult before: think Starsky \u0026amp Hutch’s Paul Michael Glaser in a double-knit wool, cerillo and merino knit, with belt, or Jeff Bridges as “the Dude” in a Native American-inspired Westerley cardigan in The Big Lebowski. But the garment has never been taken seriously until now.“It is being treated slightly differently,” says Damien Paul, the head of menswear at Matchesfashion. “The notion of the cardigan as a stuffy piece of knitwear is old-fashioned and it’s now a statement in itself.”There are several styles of cardigan which serve different purposes, and men’s high fashion has embraced them all wholeheartedly. Big and chunky thin, worn as a layer under a piece bright and statement-like, contrasting massively with the rest of your get up.“Just look at the recent AW 2020 menswear collections there were so many fantastic cardigans, the variety was quite impressive,” says the stylist Matthew Marden. “Loewe, DSquared, Bode, Isabel Marant, Sacai, all had amazing options. Cardigans have always been much more exciting than they are often given credit for.”The rise of the cardigan seems to also tie into another trend: the growing importance of coziness for consumers. With the bedding and sleep industries estimated to be worth billions a year, feeling comfortable is big business. As Michael Janiak, a co-founder of the branding agency Pattern, told the US news website Vox: “Right now people just want to feel safe,. The world’s kind of fucked up and it feels crazy. When that happens people tend to pull in, pull their social circle in and retreat into their homes a little bit, and it affects consumer behaviour and perception.”It’s something that the Hanks cardigan feeds into. Roger’s mother, Nancy, made the first cardigan her son wore on TV, the film’s costume designer told the Hollywood Reporter. “I think there was a comfort to that cardigan.“A lot of things he did were to draw audiences in and make them believe it was a safe place. There is a very deliberate gentility and comfort you can’t get with another garment.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c914f5fd44504dd37ec18c3d28f2484d09df5681/871_1102_2904_1743/master/2904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94c72c9b875d410b9541be80e889193c","title":"how to dress walk life balance jess cartner morley","story":"It’s an outfit that can deal with January realities – the walk to the station, the chance of rain – but that doesn’t look as if you have given upYou know what work-life balance is, right? Whether or not you have it, I’m guessing you are familiar with the concept. So allow me to introduce you to my new daytime dressing philosophy of walk-life balance. Work-life balance, but make it fashion.Walk-life balance means an outfit that you can do the hard yards of your day in (that’s the walk part) but which also makes you feel like you have a life. An outfit that can deal with January realities – the walk to the station, the ever-present possibility of rain, that really unattractive weird thing that skin does in the winter of crumbling to dust unseen under jumpers – but which doesn’t make you feel like you have completely given up.It is very important to look a tiny bit fabulous on run-of-the-mill days. Much more important, actually, than for special occasions, because tea-bath-bed days are when you need the lift. I don’t mean a ballgown at the bus stop, although be my guest if you can be bothered. I mean the feel of a nice blouse against your skin, the glint of a pair of earrings, a shot of colour added to your look. These are tiny talismans to help you keep faith with joy and fun when high days and holidays feel a long way away.The walk part starts with your shoes. A comfortable, closed-toe, puddle-proof mid-heeled shoe is a wardrobe treasure to be cherished. (These Tommy Hilfiger loafers, worn in to perfection, have been resoled several times.) Don’t get me wrong, trainers are great, but even a tiny heel gives you a psychological boost, as well as a vertical one. A couple of inches of height also tends to make trousers more flattering (always cheering) and avoids soggy hems (always dispiriting).The life element of the balancing act means adding some fashion content, which doesn’t have to be sequins or slogans.The decentred silhouette of the shirt I’m wearing here adds interest without being tricky to wear. If you can’t face the day in anything but a crew neck sweater, layer a shirt underneath in a bright colour and pull the cuffs out to make a feature of them. Tie a silk scarf around your ponytail or cinch your blazer with a belt.It can – it should – be simple. This is about real life, so just keep it real.

More than 30 years on, male wish-fulfilment still comes with those facilely superior Schwarzenegger features attached. His son, Patrick, plays the childhood imaginary friend who comes to the aid of a depressed student photographer in the new mental health-themed psychodrama Daniel Isn’t Real. At first, Daniel is egging on beleaguered Luke (Miles Robbins) to play the sensitive artist for the ladies next thing, the alter ego is hijacking Luke’s body to engage in rough sex in underground tunnels and murdering his therapist.Adam Egypt Mortimer’s film is good unclean fun, Luke’s psychological meltdown slathered all over in gooey effects. But, as you are probably gathering, it’s not the most sensitive depiction of mental illness ever made. It seems to pick up where Joker, another showboating work about a toxic proxy, left off. Medical professionals rounded on Todd Phillips’s film, accusing it of perpetuating “the hackneyed association between serious mental illness and extreme violence”. Into the same discourse, which is demanding greater care in terms of how mental health is represented on screen, swaggers Daniel Isn’t Real. It will face the same question: is this outré, batshit-crazy approach still acceptable?Perhaps unsurprisingly, the upswell of public discussion around mental illness hasn’t resulted in a sudden increase in films about the subject. It’s a complex topic, rarely box-office gold. But the acknowledgement that mentally ill characters shouldn’t be consigned to the asylum of the criminally insane, like Psycho’s Norman Bates, dates back some time now. From One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) to A Beautiful Mind (2001) to Silver Linings Playbook (2012), there has been more of a consensus that the mentally ill are protagonists, not villains, and deserve a sympathetic hearing. We are them, they are us.But, despite this, the less restrained school of mental-health portrayal gallivants down the staircase. Joker’s perceived insensitivities haven’t stopped it raking in more than $1bn (£750m). Darren Aronofsky’s Black Swan (2010), with Natalie Portman plucking hallucinatory feathers from her goose pimples, doesn’t exactly take the documentary approach to the quest for artistic perfection.Ditto Donnie Darko (2001) regarding teen alienation, with its interdimensional rabbit envoy, Frank. Steven Soderbergh’s wide lens-induced delirium in 2018’s Unsane was the digital-era equivalent of the Dutch angle, the off-kilter camera position habitually used to signify being in the presence of someone of unsound mind (Cesar Romero’s TV Joker often got the treatment).With some of Joker’s defenders claiming it validated their experience as people with mental-health difficulties, as outsiders, it raises the question: what does an authentic approach to mental illness on screen entail? Maybe there are two broad approaches to the subject: an interior, realistic approach attuned to the detail of inner psychological shifts and an exterior one, such as in Joker, writing mental-health conditions large with lurid storylines and flamboyant visuals. But cinema – which lacks the novel’s privileged access to the mind – has a tendency to drift towards exteriorising: the easy visual, the dramatic flourish. Even films that are otherwise exemplary models of realism do this, such as Girl, Interrupted. Angelina Jolie’s Lisa is a kind of rock’n’roll wish-fulfilment figure for Winona Ryder’s narrator, not so different from Schwarzenegger Jr in Daniel Isn’t Real.The exterior approach to mental health isn’t necessarily, as Joker’s critics might have it, the less authentic one. The visual vocabulary used by the likes of Shutter Island and Unsane – the deranged camera angles, high-contrast lighting – is derived from the German expressionism of 1920s, which had a hotline to the psychological forces bubbling beneath society. The jagged, distorted sets of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari either climb inside the head of the film’s hypnotist mastermind, or convey the dissociative state Conrad Veidt’s murderous sleepwalker falls into the central gimmick of The Hands of Orlac – a concert pianist acquires a murderer’s hands in a transplant operation – is both totally ridiculous and a brilliant expression of suppressed rage.In its intimate knowledge and fascination with extreme mental states, German expressionism was the inheritor of the gothic tradition. Joker follows this lineage explicitly: his iconic rictus is taken from The Man Who Laughs, a 1928 film by German expressionist Paul Leni, an adaptation of Victor Hugo’s gothic-tinged novel. The underlying idea – the horror of being unable to convey your inner feelings – is updated by Phillips in the light of today’s mental health epidemic.We should bear this tradition in mind when we are presented with mental-health-related films on the more colourful end of the spectrum. Maybe realism isn’t important these are the fantasies we are watching, the interior made exterior. The figure of the alter ego, that gothic favourite, is particularly important on this score. It’s amazing how often it crops up in some form in mental-health cinema, as a mouthpiece for the protagonist’s desires, sporting the badge of the id – from figments such as in Daniel Isn’t Real and Tyler Durden in Fight Club, to a person who becomes a vehicle for projected emotions such as in Girl, Interrupted and Black Swan, in which Portman obsesses over a rival ballerina.It’s as if these old expressionist mechanisms mirror the way a mind under pressure can flex and distort reality. This is one place fiction flows out of. So this approach is powerful when precisely deployed. It’s true that Joker is undisciplined about how it blurs the lines between Arthur Fleck’s inner life and the real world, giving licence to those who believe it both dangerously indulges the character and is irresponsible on the mental-health front. (The accusation is doubly true compared with its source film The King of Comedy, which draws clear moral lines around Rupert Pupkin’s delusional behaviour.) But Joker’s reckless approach is thankfully grounded in Joaquin Phoenix’s all-in performance, which suggests second-by-second lived understanding of mental instability.Of course, the expressionist mental-health movie shouldn’t be the orthodoxy. There is a need for nuanced explorations of the topic – and those films do get made, though probably not frequently enough. But it would be a shame if the current call for respectful depictions ruled out an approach that can cleave the knot of the subject with splendid indelicacy. Depression and writer’s block doesn’t inevitably lead to an axe-murder spree, à la The Shining, but the film quickly captures a level of pent-up frustration most writers (and maybe some janitors) will understand.The OTT approach doesn’t have to be taken literally, or some definitive statement that people with mental-health problems are dangerous. Fantasy is empowering too, in the right doses, in the right places.

It’s NEVER going to end!” That’s a cop, locked up in a secure psychiatric facility after shooting half his face off, ranting about the curse that drove him insane. His words may also be a healthy response to news that Sam Raimi has rebooted The Grudge haunted-house franchise. (Brief history: Takashi Shimizu directed the decent original and a sequel in Japan and made two out of three of the subpar Hollywood follow-ons.) Raimi produces here while directing duties pass to 30-year-old American Nicolas Pesce, who has come up with this franchise oddity: a mainstream horror movie with arthouse sensibilities, a potentially interesting streak of bleak realism and naturalistic performances – but zero scares. Forget about chilling to the bone, The Grudge barely drops below room temperature.Pesce does solid work piecing together several story strands within a fragmented time structure. Andrea Riseborough gives a grounded naturalistic performance as Detective Muldoon, a cop grieving her husband’s death, which deserves a better film. Muldoon’s investigation into the death of a woman in some woods leads her to a string of gruesomely senseless murders, all connected to one suburban house. The owner, Fiona Landers (Tara Westwood), has recently returned from Tokyo and seems to have transported the curse from the earlier movies in her hand luggage. Bad news for Fiona and anyone who sets foot in her house: they’re all lumbered with the murderous wrath of the demon with the long black hair and croaky death rattle (Junko Bailey).There are scenes here that should be scary but fall flat. A woman chews at the bloodied stumps of her own fingers. Nope. Maggots crawl into the nasal cavities of a decaying corpse. Nothing. The Grudge never gets going. And while Pesce doesn’t go overboard plundering the original films, the scares that he does resurrect – what’s that lurking under the surface of the scummy bath water? – are so well-parodied by now that they’re not creepy any more. Is there a ravenous fanbase demanding more of this? The Grudge may well be back for two or three more films, but I can’t help praying it stays dead and buried.

The good-natured sledging in the stands will doubtless amuse but the oddity of the game represents another desperately sad marker in Coventry’s odyssey from Sixfields to St Andrew’s.In June Coventry struck a groundshare agreement with Birmingham for this season after failing to agree a deal to stay at the Ricoh Arena, the purpose-built stadium into which they moved from Highfield Road in 2005. But Coventry’s volatile relationship with the Ricoh, which was sold to the Premiership rugby club Wasps six years ago, has long been a source of frustration, the club having previously ground-shared with Northampton in 2013-14.As much as Coventry are grateful for Birmingham’s help while they floundered in search of viable alternatives to the Ricoh, and a unique atmosphere is inevitable, the novelty factor cannot mask the painful reality of another kick in the teeth for a suffering fanbase.“They are providing us with a home that we didn’t have, and they have probably kept the club alive by giving us a stadium, but this should not be some sort of strange love-in or a kind of party atmosphere,” says Neil White, a board member of the Sky Blues Trust who is into his 52nd year supporting Coventry. “We cannot make this out as a fun day because we do not want this to be our future. Football binds family and friends and a city’s team should be at the heart of its community, not a travelling circus.”After securing a point in the Championship at Middlesbrough on Tuesday, Pep Clotet’s Birmingham side will return to familiar surroundings – albeit as the away team. The squad will board the team coach at their training ground on the outskirts of the city before making the 10-mile journey to St Andrew’s, where they will occupy the away dressing room. Birmingham have sold out their away allocation of 9,260 tickets. The Tilton End – where the seats spell out Birmingham’s nickname, the Blues, in block capitals – will be home to Sky Blues for the day.As strange as Saturday will be, it is not the first time tenants have played host to their landlords. The first groundshare agreement in the Football League was between Charlton and Crystal Palace, after the former left the Valley in 1985 before returning to the site in 1992, and Wimbledon spent 12 seasons ground-sharing with Palace at Selhurst Park, during which time Palace were the visitors to their own stadium on nine occasions, notably in a League Cup victory in October 1994, before relocating to Milton Keynes.“They got in your minds, got in your heads and it was the weirdest thing going into the away dressing room at your home stadium, and at Selhurst it is literally a 20x20m box with some showers and a toilet. Once you get out there you just have to shut all that out and get on with it, but it did ultimately feel like playing away from home.”It was a peculiar state of play for both parties. “We were conditioned by our environment,” explains the former Wimbledon defender John Scales. “Our training ground was down on the A3, the legendary transport cafe there with Frank, the guy behind the counter, and everybody coming in from the lorries for breakfast and him putting his finger through the bread rolls. Plough Lane was an intricate part of that, where famously Viv Anderson and Fash clashed. That was in that corridor leading out to the tunnel, which is about 3ft wide, with a couple of the lights flickering away and it had a dirty, wet floor, which was one of the key psychological levellers for us. Suddenly we find ourselves at Selhurst Park and it was difficult, it was odd. Awkward.”Scales adds: “Fundamentally it is not nice not having your own ground – you feel like a team that has lost a big chunk of its identity without having its own ground and therefore you feel a little bit nomadic and the outside guest at a party when you’re there. It is an awkward feeling but by and large you don’t really think about it and you get used to the routine very quickly. That whole move from Plough Lane was very detrimental to Wimbledon as a club.We know the hoo-ha with the ground being sold and what happened but I think that was so much the beginning of the end, the move away to Selhurst.”Coventry-Birmingham has never been the fiercest of rivalries – they share a mutual dislike for Aston Villa – and relations between the clubs have understandably blossomed, particularly at boardroom level. Before kick-off several pubs will be open to both sets of supporters and, at half-time, the clubs’ community trusts will do battle in a five-aside game.The match, including mandatory segregation, is expected to be a sellout, meaning the attendance will comfortably be Coventry’s biggest at the stadium this season, more than double the 8,085 that attended their League One match against Ipswich in December. Home crowds struggled to surpass the 2,000 mark during 2013-14 at Sixfields but this season, undoubtedly aided by the impressive strides the team have made under the manager, Mark Robins, they have averaged around 6,000, with a healthy number of Coventry fans regularly making the 22-mile pilgrimage.There is also a hint of irony in Coventry, homeless following a messy orce from the Ricohthat included a protracted legal row, playing host at a stadium that Birmingham sold to their owner Paul Suen Cho Hung’s parent company for £22.8m to reduce losses with the Football League’s financial fair play rules in mind.Coventry are fourth in the league and unbeaten in seven matches but how many fans would they attract to Birmingham if they were rock bottom? “Robins is, in my opinion, the best manager we have had since we won the FA Cup in 1987,” says White. “But we need to be clear that the owners of the Ricoh, Wasps, and the owners of Coventry, Sisu, need to get together to do a deal to bring us back to the city. We are the only team in the Football League where, frankly, we don’t know where we are playing next season.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e41961fb4acbc400dce80388c0165c46c28196f2/1188_0_3080_1848/master/3080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f45a414b07534b7b34c8e6a53bc04a5","title":"transfer news and fa cup previews weekend football countdown live","story":"Wycombe striker Scott Kashket has been banned from all football-related activity for six months, with four months suspended, for betting breaches, the FA has announced.Kashket’s betting activity took place between the period of September 2014 and August 2016, when he played for Leyton Orient.

About 5.5 million people in rural Zimbabwe face starvation.According to Reuters, Zimbabwe’s agriculture minister, Perrance Shiri, said this week that the country has less than 100,000 tonnes of grain in its strategic reserves. The grain reserve has a 500,000-tonne capacity, but has been run down after a poor harvest. Zimbabwe consumes 80,000 tonnes of maize every month.The World Food Programme says it needs a further $200m (£152m) to meet hunger needs in the country.The report’s authors called on the country to adopt policies such as feeding programmes and food aid.With households fast running out of food, most children of school age are in danger of starvation. Schoolchildren often faint during class, according to humanitarian organisations, heightening calls for food aid in schools.“As children grow, the consequences of poverty are compounded, taking an enormous toll on their wellbeing – and their ability to build a better future for themselves, their families and their communities.”“This is of great concern to Unicef, and it is our hope that as we come together on agenda 2030, serious consideration is made … to ensure that children do not bear a disproportionate burden of the impact on poverty,” said Moshiri.The surge in poverty has been attributed to acute food shortages as a result of the current economic crisis and the crippling effects of the El Niño-induced drought on agricultural productivity. Hilal Elver, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, last year warned that Zimbabwe was on the verge of manmade starvation, adding that children would be the most affected as s fail to provide a balanced diet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d77c9a350bd77478321525a09eed8cc6af38f3/0_517_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcc7368196d4b681607e118575c12f79","title":"how has your workplace treated bereaved parents","story":"As paid leave for bereaved parents is being introduced under Jack’s Law, we want to hear what parents experienced at work after they lost a childBereaved parents are now entitled to two weeks’ paid leave from work under the new Jack’s Law.We want to hear from bereaved parents who had to juggle the grief, trauma and practicalities of their child’s death with the demands of their employers.

Maybe a guy with a long scarf bicycles past with a pile of books and an oar on each shoulder. Inside, we find a black woman attempting to report a crime to a police inspector, who is theatrically banging his head on the desk and shouting: “Bo-ring!” Could she just tell him about how – . No, she couldn’t, he says, because this is a lovely country, so her experience simply hasn’t happened. He wants us to come together. Why doesn’t she? She needs to stop being the – what’s the expression? Fly in the ointment? Skeleton in the closet? It’s on the tip of his tongue. In fact, if anything, says the inspector, he has been the victim of a crime. Warming to his theme, he rules that the real criminal is her for raising it.Cue opening titles of ITV’s big new Sunday night detective drama: HATHAWAY.In any sane world – I know, right? – this show would already be in production, because that’s the way it has always been, meaning it’s the RIGHT way. First, there was Inspector Morse, starring Inspector Morse, and he was deferentially assisted by Sergeant Lewis. Then, when Morse went to the great whodunnit in the sky, Sergeant Lewis made inspector and, in due course, he got his own show: Lewis. Inspector Lewis was in turn deferentially assisted by Sergeant Hathaway, who I assumed was real, but was apparently played by the actor, musician and thought leader Laurence Fox. In due course, Inspector Lewis himself bowed out, by which point Hathaway had been promoted to inspector.And yet: no eponymous Sunday night show of his own. No deferential sergeant of his own. It’s a scandal. This was the way things were – but now they are not. Similarly, just as there had always been iconic roles for James Fox back in the day, so there would surely always be the same for his son Laurence.But now, evidently, there aren’t. So I want you to forget everything you think you know about what happened since Laurence went on Question Time last week and told a mixed-race audience member she was being racist to him by making boring charges of racism. Tempting as it might be to misdiagnose, this is not just the sort of midlife crisis you would expect from one of the lesser telly chefs.No, THIS is the reality: Laurence’s story is a tale from acting’s rust belt, about the hollowing out of the theatrical heartlands, where the job and dignity your father could count on have been stolen. By whom? I don’t know. Sikhs maybe? We’ll get onto that later. For now, it is increasingly clear that the old certainties have evaporated. And there are some people who are going to feel very, very left behind. We should listen to these actors.Indeed, this is why Laurence could be found on Julia Hartley-Brewer’s TalkRadio show by Monday morning, expanding on his QT rant, going: “We lay all our troubles on the working man. And the working man has had enough of it.”Damn straight. I’ve always felt Laurence has huge second-toughest-at-Rada energy to him. And just like him, I’m sick of these elites who have never done a tough day down t’acting pit. The hardscrabble truth is that the theatrical economy no longer works in the way it did for your daddy or his daddy before him. Or, to put it more specifically re Laurence’s situation: how come HE’S not admiring Hitler in Remains of the Day, while Tony Hopkins has to miss his own dad’s death because he’s got the dinner to serve? Instead, Laurence feels as if his only choice is going on James Delingpole’s podcast to lose his shit that there’s a Sikh in Sam Mendes’s 1917 movie. I mean, I guess it’s zeitgeisty. But set against his dad’s zeitgeisty stuff, it’s not exactly sharing some acid and a French chick with Mick Jagger in Performance, is it?And, of course, when hope moves out, Trump moves in. I think this is why Laurence recently announced that he put on a Maga hat and walked round wherever he lives in south London. He says one woman told him he was crazy. A bit like that scene in Die Hard 3 where Bruce Willis has to stand in Harlem wearing a racist sign or everyone’s going to get blown up by villain Jeremy Irons. (Sidenote: a contempo version of that is exactly the sort of part Laurence should have had. But they have skipped him and gone straight for Tom Hiddleston, haven’t they? The shits.)As for what attracted Fox to Trump, maybe it was the president’s deathless comment: “I love the poorly educated.” And putting my own public school heritage to use, I want to attain the levels of empathy Laurence rose to on Question Time. So I’ll just inform him definitively that a huge amount of his bitterness springs from the fact he went to a minor public school. (Harrow. I will not be taking letters on this classification thank you.)Certainly his outsider shtick is my favourite since Jacob Rees-Mogg (who didn’t go to a minor public school) told last year’s Conservative party conference: “But as I grew up in the British establishment, I know how awful it is. I see its faults perhaps more clearly than most do, and its determination, its anti-democratic wish to cling to its power come what may.” Then again, I think we all have to make a lot of time for the latest effusion from Lily Allen (Bedales), who reacted to Laurence’s nonsense by announcing she was “sick to death of luvvies forcing their opinions on everybody else” and advising him to “stick to acting”. Say what you like about this story, but it really has brought all the preposterous pricks to the yard – and yes, I certainly count myself in that.As for where Laurence could have gone after QT, I suppose he could have donned the Black Poloneck of Poorly Essayed Contrition. I refer of course to the night that Dapper Laughs opted to become Dapper Tears, and appeared on Newsnight to apologise for “pushing the boundaries”.Instead, Fox decided to double down, telling Delingpole of the “oddness” of casting a Sikh in 1917. “It is kind of racist,” he honked, “if you talk about institutional racism, which is what everyone loves to go on about, which I’m not a believer in, there is something institutionally racist about forcing ersity on people in that way.”When the contribution of Sikh soldiers to the first world war was later mentioned to him, he replied: “I’m not a historian.” But luv: you don’t NEED to be a historian. You honestly just need access to the website google. Because if you search the words “Sikhs” and “first world war”, every single result from the very first one down will tell you how Sikh soldiers arrived on the Western front from 1914, how they were instrumental at Ypres, and so on for miles and miles. It literally couldn’t be easier to find out about. But you see, basic investigations aren’t the Hathaway MO. The Hathaway MO is to be profoundly incurious, to not ask any questions at all, or attempt to learn anything, or to think that people with different experiences may have a different point to make from yours. You just accuse the Sikh of ruining the movie.As for where people of colour go after their latest tedious schooling, perhaps they could take #inspo from Laurence himself. After all, this is a man who has repeatedly hawked his orce experiences round the TV interview sofas, in return for the show plugging his band or whatever – yet who begrudges people of colour having the temerity to have their own problems.Yet again, I think the conclusion is that people of colour need to be EVEN more creative in the way they talk about their experiences to snowflakes like Laurence. Just spitballing here, but would it help if they got caught up in a celebrity orce, then had a crap album to promote? Because I feel like then it might finally be permissible for them to speak. Until then, his message is clear: you’re still doing it wrong, guys!

In reality, however, you are either pressed up against a metal barrier as beer (you hope it’s beer) rains down on your head, or stuck at the back, desperately trying to make out the tiny figures on stage. But, presented with ever-higher ticket prices, music fans have become more demanding hence a rise in immersive, Secret Cinema-style gigs.Last year, Skepta’s Dystopia987 in Manchester was billed as “a waking dream that presents Skepta’s singular vision of the future”. Part gig, part theatre, the location was revealed via SMS on the day (phones were then banned during the show), with the audience escorted by masked actors to an industrial warehouse. Tokens could be exchanged for flashing LED strips to glue to your face, because why not?Meanwhile, at Travis Scott’s second annual Astroworld festival – inspired by his youth spent at Houston’s original Astroworld theme park – guests could ride ferris wheels and carousels surrounded by roaming performers and a 35ft-high planetarium projecting lasers. The rapid growth of technology has made ever more ridiculous ideas possible. Where Skepta banned phones, the sci-fi and tech-loving US rock band Starset embrace them, with augmented reality allowing a huge virtual spaceship to land on the stage.But immersive does not have to mean futuristic. Last year’s Legitimate Peaky Blinders festival saw the streets of Digbeth transformed into a fully realised 1920s experience with live music, performance, poetry, theatre and flat caps. This May, there is Human Traffic.Live, a “theatrical rave show” based on the 1999 cult film, featuring actors, breakdancers and trampolinists (not on pingers, we hope). And the only way you can hear Yasiin Bey’s first album in a decade will be at a museum, while nodding thoughtfully at murals by contemporary artists. If those are not to your taste, what about the Willy Wonka-meets-electronic music of Unusual Ingredients, where sound artists will pair honey, coffee and seaweed with specially composed pieces of music?Are these shows a glimpse of what gigs could be or something of a fad? Skepta’s show, for example, met with criticism for being an airbrushed approximation of a rave. But really, if songs are about telling a story, it is natural that pop stars might want to showcase theirs in the most all-encompassing way. If they get it right, it could be incredible. Imagine a fully immersive version of Beyoncé’s Lemonade with Jay-Z begging for forgiveness in a secret room, or a multisensory version of Slowthai’s Nothing Great About Britain with all the sights, smells and … Oh, OK, maybe not.

I found myself entertaining a recurring daydream of escaping from time. I would be hustling my son out the door to get him to school, or walking briskly to work on the day of a deadline, or castigating myself for being online when I should have been methodically and efficiently putting words on paper, and I would have this vision of myself as a character in a video game discovering a secret level. This vision was informed by the platform games I loved as a child – Super Mario Bros, Sonic the Hedgehog and so on – in which the character you controlled moved across the screen from left to right through a scrolling landscape, encountering obstacles and adversaries as you progressed to the end of the level. In this daydream, I would see myself pushing against a wall or lowering myself down the yawning mouth of a pipe, and thereby discovering this secret level, this hidden chamber where I could exist for a time outside of time, where the clock was not forever running down to zero.My relationship with time had always been characterised by a certain baleful anxiety, but as I approached the start of the decade in which I would have no choice but to think of myself as middle-aged, this anxiety intensified. I was always in the middle of some calculation or quantification with respect to time, and such thoughts were always predicated on an understanding of it as a precious and limited resource. What time was it right now? How much time was left for me to do the thing I was doing, and when would I have to stop doing it to do the next thing?This resource being as limited as it was, should I not be doing something better with it, something more urgent or interesting or authentic? At some point in my late 30s, I recognised the paradoxical source of this anxiety: that every single thing in life took much longer than I expected it to, except for life itself, which went much faster, and would be over before I knew where I was.Much of this had to do with being a parent. Having two young children had radically altered my relationship with the days and hours of my life. Almost every moment was accounted for in a way that it had never been before. But it was also the sheer velocity of change, the state of growth and flux in which my children existed, and the constant small adjustments that were necessary to accommodate these changes. I would realise that my son no longer mispronounced a particular word in that adorable way he once had, or that his baby sister had stopped doing that thing of nodding very seriously and emphatically when she heard a song she liked – that she was, in fact, no longer a baby at all – and that those eras had now passed for good, along with countless others that would pass unnoticed and unremembered, and I would feel sad and remorseful about not having lived more fully in those moments, not having stopped or at least slowed the flow of time. And when I felt this way, I would succumb to the daydream of the video game, the secret level, the escape from time itself.My son turned six around then, itself a significant milestone in that he was, for the first time, at an age I myself could dimly remember being. And with this new phase of parenthood, I began to think how strange it was, given how precious those early years now seemed to me, that I spent so little time thinking about my own childhood, the lost civilisation on which my adult self now stood. The motion of the video game unfurled rightward, and I had no choice but to follow its motion towards the future, towards the completion of the game itself.And then one day, about a week and a half before I turned 40, I found myself alone in a forest in Devon, where I discovered this secret level of my daydreams.Here is how I did it: I came to a clearing in a forest by a riverbank in Dartmoor national park, far enough from any trail that it seemed unlikely I would encounter anyone while I was there. I gathered some loose branches and stones and arranged them in a circle of about 10 metres in diameter, and then I walked into the circle and did not leave it until the same time the following day.The short version of this story is that nothing happened in that time: that I did nothing and witnessed nothing, experienced only the passage of the hours and minutes, and the languid dynamics of my own boredom. The long version isn’t exactly The Iliad, either, but in that version something could be said to have happened. Because by the time I walked out of that circle the following afternoon, I’d had an entirely unexpected and intensely cathartic encounter with the passage of time, and with my own mortality.This is a practice commonly referred to as a “wilderness solo”. The basic principle is that you go out into nature, the wilder and more remote the better, and confine yourself to one very small area for a set period – a day, two days, three days, sometimes longer. During this period, you forego anything that might come between yourself and your own solitude. No phone. No books or other reading material. You don’t build a fire, because building a fire is a way to keep yourself busy, watching the dance of its flames a primitive entertainment. Most participants choose not to bring food, because when you have got nothing to do for a day and a night, the prospect of eating a sandwich can easily become an all-encompassing preoccupation, undermining the entire project of unmediated communion with nature. After that period of immersion, you step outside of your circle, and you re-enter the world.Until fairly recently, I was not a person who had a lot of time for nature. I wished it well in all its dealings, and was glad to take its side in any quarrel with the forces arrayed against it, but my regard for it was essentially abstract, and I would just as soon have left it to its own devices. Nature was something I encountered as scenery, an experience to be consumed before getting back in the car and continuing on my way. But about the middle of 2016, amid the endlessly unfurling horrors of that year’s news, I became increasingly preoccupied with how this darkening political reality seemed to foreshadow a near future defined by a permanent state of climate emergency. And these things felt connected in some way that resisted easy definition: the speed and efficiency with which technology was gutting democracy and alienating us from the reality of human suffering, and the increasing extremity of our estrangement from the natural world. I was thinking all the time about climate change, about the future my children would be forced to live in, about what we had done and were continuing to do to the world. But at some point it dawned on me that I didn’t know the first thing about that world. What I knew was the great indoors in which I lived my life: the insides of buildings, the insides of books, the interlocking interiors of the internet and my own mind. When I talked about nature, I didn’t know what I meant. In a way that was somehow both vague and urgent, I felt that it was time to go outside.I came across an organisation called Way of Nature UK that arranged group wilderness retreats, and I signed up for a trip. This was how, in the spring of 2017, I ended up spending a week with a group of about 20 other people in a remote wilderness reserve called Alladale in the Scottish Highlands, towards the end of which everyone went off to various locations and did a solo. How did I feel about sitting by a river for 24 hours and doing absolutely nothing, aside from looking at grass and clouds and water and so on? I felt slightly intimidated. I felt uncomfortable. I felt, above all, reflexively cynical, in the way that I was reflexively cynical about pretty much anything that felt new-agey or hippyish or otherwise overly earnest to me. But over the course of that week, and in particular the 24 hours I spent alone by the river, that brittle carapace of cynicism began to give way. What affected me most deeply about that time alone in nature was the aspect of it I had initially been most daunted by. The experience of the solo is the experience of time itself, in its rawest and most unmediated form.When I stepped into that ad-hoc ceremonial circle in Devon last summer, it had been over a year since I had performed the ritual, and I found myself craving the solitude and immersion it provided.Andres Roberts, Way of Nature’s co-founder, picked me up that morning outside my hotel in Bristol, near where he lives. I had got to know him pretty well on the two previous trips I had done with him, and my new enthusiasm for spending time alone in nature had been informed by his quietly ecstatic way of talking about the wilderness. As we drove south along the M5 through intermittent downpours of rain, he spoke about his work, and the ideas underpinning it. If there was a single word that encapsulated the value he was trying to incubate, that word was “slowness”. There was an extraordinary transformative power, he insisted, in the practice of sitting and doing nothing, and thereby slowing your mind and body to a meditative rhythm in nature.One of Roberts’s major themes was the idea that our particular civilisation, at our particular time, was unusual in not having as part of its cultural repertoire some ritual whereby during periods of change or upheaval people went out alone into nature. When he talked about the practice of the wilderness solo, he talked about it in such terms – as a ritual whereby you stepped out of the flux of the world, in order to gain some perspective on the flux, and your place within it.A word he used a lot in talking about his work, and in describing the experience and value of the nature solo, was “re-enchantment”. He was of the opinion that most people, most of the time, lived life in a state of disenchantment. What he wanted to do, above all, was to help people strip away the layers of hard rationalism that accrued around the adult mind, so that they could return to a more childlike engagement with the world. And in reaching this state, he said, this place of re-enchantment, we could come to see ourselves not as separate from and in control of nature, but as part of it.It was harder than anticipated, finding a solo spot. We had settled on Dartmoor for its proximity to Bristol and its relatively humane weather outlook, but it was not a place with which Roberrts was particularly familiar. We followed at first a northward trail, planning to cross a footbridge into deeper forest on the far side of the river, but when we eventually found it, the gate to the footbridge was firmly padlocked.Further along the trail we met a man out for a walk with his dog. Early 70s, bearded, wax jacketed, he wore the dog’s lead draped athwart himself shoulder to hip in the manner of a mayoral sash. Roberts asked him whether there was a bridge we could cross further on. He shook his head and courteously informed us, in a Devonshire accent as soft and mulchy as the ground beneath our feet, that we were on land privately owned by one of his neighbours, and that the more densely forested territory across the river was private, too, and that we technically required a permit to walk this trail.We turned and strolled back with him toward the road, and as he chatted to us about the cottage he and his wife had recently renovated, and their troubles with the local conservation society who disapproved of their alterations to the property, I was struck by how easily the concept of private land ownership could be made to feel absurd. It seemed perfectly rational in towns and cities, in housing estates and apartment buildings, for people to own their little portions of the world. But here, on the flourishing banks of a torrential river, the thought that this place was the sole property of some mere person – that that person could own the deeds to a river bank or a forest – seemed deeply and disorientingly counterintuitive, in a way that threatened to undermine the whole spirit of our enterprise. It felt impossible, as I put it to Roberts after we parted company with the man, to pursue the kind of immersive experience of a place we were after when you worried you might be trespassing.He reassured me, though, that we would find a suitable place for my solo, on commonly owned land where I wouldn’t have to worry about some local squire coming along and telling me I had no business having an immersive experience with his privately owned nature.We found another trail, running northward along the River Dart. Roberts lowered his voice to not much more than a whisper, eventually stopping talking altogether, and slowed his pace so that I was walking well ahead of him. I understood this deliberate minimisation of his own presence to mean that we had entered a kind of buffer zone between the outside world and the solo space. This was one of the great charms of how he worked without his having seemed to do anything very specific, you were made to understand that some ritual was underway, that you were somehow in the midst of the sacred.The point of being here is to be here. An hour or two into my time in the forest, I wrote these words in my notebook, and drew a box around them to emphasise their authority and self-sufficiency. And then I stopped writing words in my notebook altogether, because writing words is my work, and I was wary of taking an utilitarian approach to the solo. The point of being there, after all, was to be there. (The cynical reader might argue that the point of being there was to write about being there – an argument the cynical writer will, on balance, concede, if only to avoid getting bogged down in the ontological complexities of the whole relationship between experiencing things and writing about them.)And what did I do, while I was being there, in the forest, by the river? Nothing, more or less. The first half hour or so, there was a certain amount of housekeeping to attend to. I had to find exactly the right spot: not too damp flat enough to pitch a tent once night began to fall sheltered from the elements, but not so sheltered as to obscure the view of the river and the far bank. I had to mark out the circle, of course. I had to gather flat stones and sticks and bits of branches, and arrange them around a beech tree I had chosen as the central feature of my location. It could, I suppose, have been an oak tree, or an elm, or some other type of lofty deciduous of which I, being no Robert MacFarlane, had no prior knowledge.But once all that was out of the way, I had to confront that fact of having nothing to do. In theory, I should have greeted this experience with open arms. I had, in fact, been looking forward to it for weeks – to having no tasks to attend to, no places to go, no obligations to meet. Here I was with nothing to do but inhabit the spaciousness of every passing moment, to bathe at leisure in the pooled flow of time itself. In theory, it was the dream. In practice, if I could have taken out my phone and gone on Twitter I surely would have. (Thankfully, this possibility was foreclosed to me by the fact of having no mobile coverage. In any case, I’d stowed my phone in my backpack in order to stop myself violating the spirit of the wilderness solo by spending the whole time looking through photos of my children, or opening up the New Yorker app and immersing myself not in nature, but in back issues of a magazine I never had the time to read, for reasons gestured at above.)When you’re actually in it, the reality of the solo is, at least at first, one of total boredom. I cannot stress enough how little there is to do when you have confined yourself to the inside of a small circle of stones and sticks in a forest. But it is an instructive kind of boredom, insofar as boredom is the raw and unmediated experience of time. It is considered best practice not to have a watch, and to turn off your phone and keep it somewhere in the bottom of a bag so as to avoid the temptation to constantly check how long you’ve been out and how long you have left. And as you become untethered from your accustomed orientation in time – from always knowing what time it is, how long you have to do the thing you’re doing, when you have to stop doing it to do the next thing – you begin to glimpse a new perspective on the anxiety that arises from that orientation. Because this anxiety, which amounts to a sort of cost-benefit analysis of every passing moment, is a quintessentially modern predicament.As weirdly counterintuitive as it feels to acknowledge, human beings are not naturally predisposed to think of life in terms of seconds and hours, of how they might be optimised. The development of mechanical clocks during the middle ages and, later, the advent of widespread precision timekeeping that facilitated the industrial revolution, fundamentally changed the way in which the human animal related to the world. Time became both an abstraction and a commodity, a raw material to be bought and sold, saved or squandered.The mass adoption of this new conception of time, abstract and removed from the organic context of nature, was central to the rise of capitalism, and to the accelerating mechanisation of life. “Beginning in the 14th century,” as the American cultural critic Neil Postman put it, “the clock made us into time-keepers, and then time-savers, and now time-servers. In the process, we have learned irreverence toward the sun and the seasons, for in a world made up of seconds and minutes, the authority of nature is superseded.” To sit by a river for a day and a night is to experience the reinstatement, if only temporarily, of that authority.What did I do, sitting in that forest? I drank a lot of water, because I had brought a lot of water, and drinking it was, if only in the most basic of senses, something to do. And because I drank a lot of water, I took a great many resulting pisses around the far side of the tree, and this too presented something to do, however minor. I would occasionally treat myself to a bit of a stand, or even a little stroll around my circle, but mostly I was content to sit propped against my backpack with my legs spread before me on the soft carpet of leaves. I spent a lot of time looking at those leaves: holding them up to the light, observing the delicate webbings, the desiccated veins, crumbling them slowly between my fingers. This, I admit, was only slightly more interesting than doing nothing at all.The tree, in time, became a central object of my attention. I can’t say how long I spent standing in front of its trunk, staring at its covering of bright green moss, its gnarled protuberances of bark, but it must have been at least an hour. The moss was leafy, and felt both delicate and spongily resilient beneath my hand, and the longer I stared at it, the more I came to feel that I was gazing downward from a great height at a forest, that the moss was a canopy of leaves and the bark the ground beneath. The surface of the tree was its own ecosystem, expansive and intricate, and when I looked closely enough I saw that there were tiny insects everywhere, spiders and other many-legged creatures, whom I imagined living out their days aware of no other world than that little vastness, that forest within a forest.My own incapacity to give this tree a name seemed suddenly strange to me, and slightly sad. In the ordinary run of things, if I were curious enough about what kind of tree I was looking at, I would have just gone on Google, or downloaded one of those tree-recognising apps, but this option was not available to me. Then it occurred to me that there was something about the not knowing that was somehow right. Not having a human name to give the tree, a category in which to put it, made the tree more real and present to me than it otherwise would have, or so I allowed myself to believe.At some point it came to my attention that I was no longer bored, and that I had not been bored for some time. This is not to say that I was in a state of high mental stimulation, but that the hours of inactivity had induced in me a kind of meditative stupor, whereby I was receptive to the information of the environment – to the ceaseless clamour of the river, the chattering of the birds overhead, the urgent whisperings of the leaves in the breeze, the modulations of temperature and light – but uninclined to think much about this information, or anything else. I had, I realised, become attuned to the frequencies of the forest. I had found the secret level.This is a thing that has happened to me whenever I have been alone in nature for an extended period: there occurs, some hours in, a subtle but profound modulation in consciousness whereby I come to experience myself as part of the place I am in, as an organism among organisms. This is a state of mind in which I can watch a small spider crawl along my arm for many minutes, feeling a kind of sentimental fellowship with this busy, delicate creature, whom in the normal run of things I would not hesitate to brush off in irritation or disgust.In these moments, I find myself thinking of the place itself as somehow conscious of my presence. To be alone in a forest, and to be thinking of the forest as somehow aware of you: I will acknowledge that this sounds like the very substance of nightmare, but, in fact, it is a strangely beautiful and quietly moving experience, and I think it must be what people mean when they talk about intuiting the presence of God.The word that comes to mind is immanence – a term I learned as a philosophy undergraduate and which I did not remotely understand until I began to have these experiences of being alone in nature. In his 1836 essay Nature, American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson identifies precisely this sublime phenomenon. “The greatest delight which the fields and woods minister,” he writes, “is the suggestion of an occult relation between man and the vegetable. I am not alone and unacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them.” It’s a phenomenon that he views as both an apprehension of the ine and a return to the child’s perception of the world. “In the woods,” he writes, “a man casts off his years, as the snake his slough, and at what period soever of life, is always a child.”I am struck now by how strongly these lines of Emerson – these ideas of casting off years, of attaining the spirit of early childhood – resonate with the strangest and most unsettling and, in the end, most wonderful aspect of my experience in the woods. While I was there, I didn’t spend much time thinking about reaching 40, and whatever lay beyond. What I thought about was the distant past of my own childhood, which I spent in the countryside, in a house beside a small wood with a little stream running through it: a tamely arcadian surrounding which provided the setting for countless imagined adventures, battles and voyages. Something about sitting alone among the trees, looking at the river, put me in mind of that period of my life. The fact of having all this time now, and nothing to do with it the slow process by which intense boredom had given way to a kind of absent-minded and playful immersion: these were things I associated with my own childhood. I remembered what Andres Roberts had said about re-enchantment, about time in nature as a means of returning to a more childlike engagement with the world.And then for a long time I thought about my son, of how he existed in a thin space between reality and fantasy. I thought of how attached he was to his favourite toy, a small brown rabbit he carried everywhere with him, clutched in the crook of an arm, of how real and alive that rabbit was to him. This was in my mind because the previous evening, as I had unpacked at my hotel, I saw that my wife had slipped among my camping things a stuffed rabbit I myself had been deeply attached to when I was small. She had found it on a recent visit to my parents’ house, where it had been lying around for years in my childhood bedroom. That rabbit, with its floppy long limbs and its black button eyes and its faded blue dungarees, had been as real to me, as invested with surplus love, as my son’s stuffed rabbit now was to him. I thought of how soon – a year from now, or maybe less – my son’s rabbit would stop being real to him, how soon his world would lose the magic he himself had breathed into it.And I thought with a pang of how I was always hurrying him – to get dressed, to get out the door for school, to finish his dinner, to get ready for bed – and of how heedlessly I was inflicting upon him my own anxious awareness of time as an oppressive force. How before he knew where he was, his own childhood would have receded into the past, and he too would be out of the secret level of childhood and into the laterally scrolling world of adulthood.As the sun was going down in Dartmoor, I put up my tent and, in the dwindling light of the forest, rummaged in my backpack for my head-mounted torch. Inside the backpack, my hand encountered again the familiar softness of the stuffed rabbit. I held the toy a moment, smiled again at this touching and witty gesture of my wife’s, and then decided to take a photo of it to send to her when I had mobile coverage the following day. I propped the rabbit against the outer lining of the tent and turned away to rummage again in my bag for my phone, and when I turned back I was overcome by a shock of recognition. I was seeing the rabbit not as I had seen it a moment before, as an intriguing relic of the submerged civilisation of my childhood, but as I had seen it as a small boy.The rabbit was entirely alive to me in that moment. It was as though all the love I had invested in this object in those days was still contained within it, within him, and the experience of its sudden animation was overwhelming. I was looking at the rabbit, and the rabbit was looking at me, and it was seeing me, and I was both myself and the child I had once been. Whatever complex of emotions I was feeling was neither sentimental nor nostalgic in character, but powerfully existential. I felt simultaneously closer to myself as a child than I had in all the years of adulthood, and yet that sudden closeness came as an experience of loss, of immeasurable distance. It was as though time had folded in on itself, and the present was touching the past. There I was, as close to 40 as made no difference, alone in a forest on a moonless night and weeping with cathartic abandon at the sight of a threadbare stuffed animal. I was mourning my childhood, and the mourning felt long overdue.I woke early, and lay still for a time listening to water dropping from the branches and leaves onto the outer layer of my tent. I had slept more soundly than I had expected, given the hard ground beneath me and the mummifying strictures of the sleeping bag. The absolute darkness and solitude had aroused neither loneliness nor unease. I had felt strangely at home with the sounds and silences of the forest at night.Until very recently, the idea of spending a rainy morning alone in a forest would have been a profoundly unattractive one, but I found myself relishing the prospect of these last hours. The restlessness I had experienced the previous day, in that last stretch of the solo, was entirely absent now, the question of what to do with myself for several hours having come to seem nowhere near as pressing. The idea of such a question felt, in fact, somehow absurd. I went to the edge of my circle and sat down, and looked at the river.You would have thought that I’d have been more or less done with looking at the river by now, but in fact I was eager to get stuck into it again after the long night-time hours of not looking at the river. In terms of the ersions that were presently available to me, looking at the river was the hottest ticket in town. And so I sat there at the edge of my little circle on the riverbank and binge-watched the river. There is, it turns out, a lot going on at any one time in a river, especially if you’ve got nothing else to be looking at.There were birds coming and going all the time, skimming low over the water and landing on the banks. There was the occasional ambiguous shape flitting on the periphery of my vision that may well have been some kind of leaping fish. I attended in particular to a bit of river directly in front of me where the water plunged low into a sort of miniature waterfall, immediately after which it appeared to run backward into itself, a phenomenon I couldn’t begin to try to account for, but for which the most likely culprit seemed to be gravity. I stared at this spectacle for so long that a kind of optical illusion began to assert itself, whereby when I glanced up at the opposite bank, the long grass and drooping ferns seemed themselves to be engaged in sympathetic movements, swirling impossibly before my eyes. It could have been the effect of hours of meditative inactivity, or it could just have been hunger, but there was something mildly trippy about the experience.Around noon, I heard a gently insistent bird call coming from a little way upriver. I turned toward it, and saw Roberts standing not far off with his back against a tree trunk, making an owl sound with his hands cupped to his mouth. I gathered my things, and we walked in silence out of the forest, him keeping several paces behind me. This seemed both entirely deliberate and entirely natural, and its effect was to preserve a measure of my solitude as I gradually emerged from the circle, out of the secret level and back into time.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2763f0efa8c50f2ec6b8255405575b2fc09d7/62_582_1513_908/master/1513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb313e9571496990d6b5c3439fc2b017","title":"zoe brock my case against harvey weinstein podcast","story":"Like dozens of women in the entertainment industry, the actor, model and writer Zoë Brock has claimed she had a traumatic encounter with the film producer Harvey Weinstein.

Only two of these are optional, meaning 29 data elements are mandatory.Stephen Barclay came under fire late last year when, as Brexit secretary, he revealed the forms would be required even though it is a domestic trade route.The news infuriated the Democratic Unionist party, which had been promised there would be no border down the Irish Sea, and was swiftly downplayed by Barclay, who told the DUP MP Nigel Dodds days later that it was a “fairly straightforward” form.Days later Boris Johnson was accused of misleading the public when he told business leaders on a visit to Northern Ireland that they could throw the form in the bin.The exit and entry forms are mandatory and are the two parts of what is known as a safety and security certificate. It is required as part of a counter-terrorism regime devised to protect the US after the 911 attacks but is not applicable within the European Union. After Brexit, it will apply in Northern Ireland and on trade moving from Great Britain to the rest of the EU.Businesses sending goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will not be immune either. They face a form involving up to 45 elements. “Only three of these are optional, meaning that 42 data fields are mandatory,” Bastidon said.The legal basis of the forms is contained in a complex 557-page document, which is almost incomprehensible to an untrained eye.Transport chiefs and manufacturers must match codes in the document with a complex list of coded data every time goods are booked on to a ferry.Seamus Lehany, the head of the FTA in Belfast, said: “It’s the haulier who must complete the paperwork. The concern is if a mistake is made and a load refused onboard a ferry, it could then miss its sailing which would have a big impact on ‘just in time’ loads, especially for the retail trade.”Seamus Kelly, the chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland, said the checks breached the commitments made in Irish border clauses 49 and 50 in the UK and EU joint report 2017, and that “the EU were as much to blame” as the prime minister.Senior staff at Dover Port said they were also worried. They have previously said the requirement for counter-terror security declarations posed the biggest threat to frictionless trade with the EU.“The security certificate is our biggest worry,” one source said.The EU’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is to visit Belfast on Monday.His adviser Stefaan de Rynck said the EU would “not tolerate any backsliding or half measures” on the Northern Ireland protocol, and that the UK could face sanctions if it did not implement all three sets of checks: “safety and security”, customs and regulatory checks.“There are clear commitments on the UK which are legally binding and have to be implemented,” he told an audience in London on Wednesday.No government department has supplied details on the declarations since Barclay mentioned them in October despite businesses calling for more information.Instead, Johnson has been saying there will be no checks, and this week in parliament he told the DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson there would “emphatically” be no checks in either direction on goods.Business leaders from 12 sectoral organisations have called for the EU to waive the safety and security certificate and to minimise the customs and regulatory checks.Bastidon said: “The safety and security certificates can be done away with if both sides agree.”De Rynck pointed out that security certificates were not required on goods between Switzerland and the EU but that was because there was alignment on EU rules, something the chancellor, Sajid Javid, has ruled out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50acad1aff9ad9b1579a2f5ebdaf883551559664/0_8_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee030be15606b80e3c8aee105ff75cf4","title":"sombre eu leaders sign brexit withdrawal agreement","story":"Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel sign document seven days before exit dayA sombre Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the leaders of the European commission and council respectively, have formally signed the withdrawal agreement as Brussels prepares for the UK’s departure from the EU in seven days’ time.In photographs made available of the signing ceremony in the EU’s Europa building on Friday morning, the bloc’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, can be seen standing behind the two presidents.Michel, who as president of the European council will now chair meetings of 27 rather than 28 heads of state and government at the regular summits in the Belgian capital, said in a short statement: “Things will inevitably change but our friendship will remain. We start a new chapter as partners and allies.”Von der Leyen tweeted: “Charles Michel and I have just signed the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, opening the way for its ratification by the European parliament.”The signed copy of the agreement was sent in a diplomatic bag to Downing Street for the prime minister’s signature. On Thursday the withdrawal agreement received royal assent from the Queen.The document, which runs to nearly 600 pages, includes agreements on citizens’ rights, the UK’s £33bn worth of financial obligations to the bloc and the Northern Ireland protocol, establishing the arrangements for maintaining an open border on the island of Ireland.The European parliament’s constitutional affairs committee backed the agreement on Thursday by 23 votes to three, setting up the final act next week when a plenary session of the EU parliament will vote to ratify the deal.Under the agreement, the UK will leave the EU at midnight central European time on 31 January. The UK will remain in the EU’s single market and customs union, but none of the decision-making bodies, until the end of 2020.Boris Johnson has said he will not take the option available to him in the withdrawal agreement of extending this transition period. The prime minister has said the 11-month period available without further extension is “ample” time to reach agreement on a comprehensive deal.The EU’s negotiating position, known as a mandate, is due to be adopted on 25 February by EU ministers attending a general affairs council, and formal negotiations will then begin on the future relationship.A political declaration on the outlines of the future relationship, which has already been given the political seal of approval in London and the EU capitals, will set the parameters of the talks as the two negotiating teams seek to replace the terms of the UK’s 45-year membership with new arrangements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7039799b7c94b898158e1fcf9d73ed45559bea82/0_124_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc27f99944627a1159b3b83998a5db83","title":"space baked chocolate chip cookies","story":"Astronauts on the ISS baked chocolate chip cookies from raw ingredients for the first time although no one has yet tasted themThe results are finally in for the first chocolate chip cookie bake-off in space.While looking more or less normal, the best cookies required two hours of baking time last month up at the International Space Station. It takes far less time on Earth, under 20 minutes.And how do they taste? No one knows. Still sealed in inidual baking pouches and packed in their spaceflight container, the cookies remain frozen in a Houston-area lab after splashing down two weeks ago in a SpaceX capsule. They were the first food baked in space from raw ingredients.The makers of the oven expected a difference in baking time in space, but not that big.“There’s still a lot to look into to figure out really what’s driving that difference, but definitely a cool result,” Mary Murphy, a manager for Texas-based Nanoracks, said this week. “Overall, I think it’s a pretty awesome first experiment.”Located near Nasa’s Johnson Space Center, Nanoracks designed and built the small electric test oven that was launched to the space station last November. Five frozen raw cookies were already up there.Luca Parmitano, an Italian astronaut, was the master baker in December, radioing down a description as he baked them one by one in the prototype Zero G Oven.The first cookie – in the oven for 25 minutes at 300F (149C) – ended up seriously under-baked. He more than doubled the baking time for the next two, and the results were still so-so.The fourth cookie stayed in the oven for two hours, and finally: success.“So this time, I do see some browning,“ Parmitano radioed. “I can’t tell you whether it’s cooked all the way or not, but it certainly doesn’t look like cookie dough any more.”Parmitano cranked the oven up to its maximum 325F (163C) for the fifth cookie and baked it for 130 minutes. He reported more success.Additional testing is required to determine whether the three returned cookies are safe to eat.As for aroma, the astronauts could smell the cookies when they removed them from the oven, except for the first.That’s the beauty of baking in space, according to Mike Massimino, a former Nasa astronaut. He now teaches at Columbia University and is a paid spokesman for DoubleTree by Hilton. The hotel chain provided the cookie dough, the same kind used for cookies offered to hotel guests. It’s offering one of the space-baked cookies to the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum for display.“The reminder of home, the connection with home, I think, can’t be overstated,” Massimino said. “From my personal experience ... food is pretty important for not just nutrition but also for morale in keeping people connected to their home and their Earth.”Eating something other than dehydrated or prepackaged food will be particularly important as astronauts head back to the moon and on to Mars.Nanoracks and Zero G Kitchen, a New York City startup that collaborated with the experiment, are considering more experiments for the orbiting oven and possibly more space appliances. What’s in orbit now are essentially food warmers.There’s an added bonus of having freshly baked cookies in space.“We made space cookies and milk for Santa this year,” Nasa astronaut Christina Koch tweeted.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of 24 January the Chinese authorities had acknowledged 830 cases and 26 deaths. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside China, in the US, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, but there is definitely potential for cases to emerge. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be 4,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 1,000 and 9,700.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and two other Chinese cities are in lockdown. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. A key concern is the range of severity of symptoms – some people appear to suffer only mild illness while others are becoming severely ill. This makes it more difficult to establish the true numbers infected and the extent of transmission between people. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and will be anxious that the virus could become more potent than it so far appears.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The NHS advises that there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World Health Organization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Healthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.

Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, is planning to build a hospital to help treat victims of the epidemic.The template is a hospital constructed hastily in Beijing in 2003 during the Sars outbreak.The UK government’s Cobra emergency committee is holding its meeting now about the outbreak.“There remain no confirmed cases, and we’re well prepared for any new diseases. All UK airports have medical experts on hand and information has been provided to all passengers returning from China,” said a spokesman for the prime minister.He added that the Department for Education was checking universities’ preparedness, given the likelihood that Chinese students may be travelling to or returning from home, to coincide with the new year holiday.Asked whether China had provided the UK with all the information it needed on the outbreak, he said: “We remain in close contact with the World Health Organization and international partners, including China.”The prime minister, Boris Johnson, won’t be attending the Cobra meeting but is expected to host a reception at Downing Street in the next hour for the lunar new year.Meanwhile, we’re told by Public Health England that it is unlikely that there will be any updated figures on those being tested for the virus in the UK until at least 3pm local time.We had been led to believe that updated figures would be available at noon.China will take stricter and more targeted measures to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, Chinese state television has reported, citing a state council meeting on virus control on Friday.“The spread of the virus has not been cut off … Local authorities should take more responsibility and have a stronger sense of urgency,” according to state media, Reuters reported.The Chinese military has released a handbook on Pneumonia Prevention and Control of New Coronavirus Infection, which Chinese media are encouraging people to forward to their circle of friends on social media.The 16-page document comes with cartoon figures of heroic Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) figures and includes guidance on hygiene and disease prevention.The British government’s Cobra emergency committee will meet today to discus the coronavirus, according to the UK prime minister’s spokesperson.The meeting will be chaired by the health secretary, Matt Hancock.Meanwhile, a letter from Britain’s chief medical officer to clinical staff warns that the “mass movement” of people within and outside China associated with the upcoming lunar new year celebrations may “amplify transmission”.The letter said anyone who was confirmed as having the virus would be transferred to an Airborne High Consequences Infectious Disease centre (HCID).According to Public Health England, there are four interim Airborne HCID centres in England. These are:• Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS foundation trust.• Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University hospitals NHS trust.At the UN briefing in Geneva, a WHO spokesperson has said that it is too early to draw conclusions on how serious the outbreak is.“We may see more mild cases as surveillance intensifies. So the issue is not so much on numbers that we know will go up,” he added.The WHO was getting its information from the Chinese authorities, he said, citing figures from midnight which recorded 830 cases including 25 deaths.The second confirmed case in Japan of the new coronavirus transited from Hong Kong to Japan by plane and Hong Kong’s health authority needs to track the flight and passengers now, according to Wong Ka-hing, director of Hong Kong’s Centre for Health Protection.Xinqi Su, a Hong Kong based AFP correspondent, reports that the patient took Cathay Dragon’s KA855 from Wuhan to Hong Kong on 19 January and then transited from Hong Kong to Japan on Cathay Pacific’s CX58.She quotes an emerging and zoonotic diseases expert, David Hui, as saying that Hong Kong is now at “serious response level” due to imported cases, but it won’t be upgraded to an “emergency” until there are local cases and continued outbreak.He added that it was “unpractical” for all members of the public to keep a mask on all day. “If you are taking public transport or going to a mall with many people, I would advice you to wear a mask. You can take off the mask when you are in an office,” Hui said.Thailand has confirmed its fifth case of the new coronavirus, a senior public health official said.“The patient is a 33-year-old woman from Wuhan on vacation,” the deputy public health minister Sathit Patucha told Reuters, adding that she was under quarantine at Rajavithi hospital and her condition was improving.The woman arrived in Bangkok on 21 January with her daughter and visited a private hospital complaining of a fever, coughing and muscle aches before being transferred to a government hospital on 23 January, Sathit said. Her daughter tested negative for the virus.A Thai woman who contracted the virus after spending the new year in Wuhan was admitted to Nakhon Pathom hospital, 40 miles (60km) west of Bangkok, on 15 January and discharged on Friday after lab tests cleared her of the virus, the public health ministry said in a statement.Thailand currently has two patients under quarantine for the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b8ddbea84a0fc7866ca0216c19ee80b2cc6622/0_138_2120_1273/master/2120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49cbc28cf6cc78ea7bae89cc9dcb358","title":"social workers tell us how you feel about your job","story":"Take part in our survey to have your say about the profession and the wider sectorWhat’s it like to be a social worker in the UK right now?We have launched the latest edition of the  Jobs Social Lives survey into the issues affecting staff at all stages of their careers – from the frontline to management.The research, carried out by Ipsos Mori on behalf of the  and new regulator Social Work England, is an opportunity to have your say about issues including workloads, pay and how the profession is viewed.Our last Social Lives study, published in 2017, found more than four-fifths of participants were proud of what they do, and more than three-quarters said they enjoyed their jobs, but most thought their caseloads were too high.Help us to find out whether the picture has changed.

Carlsen, the world champion, has surged with three straight wins following his slow start of seven draws.After 10 of the 13 rounds Caruana (US) led on 710, followed by Carlsen (Norway) 6.510, Wesley So (US) and Jorden van Foreest (Netherlands) 610. Caruana has the easiest schedule as he meets the Belarus tailender Vladislav Kovalev in round 11, while So and Carlsen are paired in the final round.Games are live and free to watch online at the official site and elsewhere. Rounds start at 12.30pm on Friday and Saturday, and at 11am for Sunday’s 13th and final session.The two leaders showed their class when in successive rounds they defeated 16-year-old Alireza Firouzja. The talented teen had captured the imagination of chess fans, first by his decision to quit Iran rather than accept its official ban on playing Israeli opponents and then by his controversial loss on time to Carlsen in the World Blitz in Moscow.Carlsen’s win began with a Ruy López finesse, as he reached a standard position after Black’s 12th move – but with Black still to play. His unusual move order earlier had persuaded Firouzja to advance a2-a3 and then a3-a4 instead of in a single step. Then Carlsen used his strategic skills to gain control with his active bishops, Firouzja never created counterplay, and although Black’s conversion was inaccurate it was good enough to win.Caruana’s victory was even more impressive since he took on Firouzja on his own territory, mazy tactics in the style of the legendary Mikhail Tal which the Iranian has used in hundreds of internet bullet and blitz games. The opening could be called a Six Pawns Attack against the sharp King’s Indian, and the game continued in this vein as Firouzja sacrificed a knight for several pawns. With the game still in the balance, he erred fatally at move 30 and Caruana pounced with a decisive attack.Firouzja’s ranking briefly touched the top 20 during his winning run, and his results at age 16 compare with Carlsen’s, so his weekend rounds starting with another legend, Vishy Anand, on Friday will be critical in judging his response to the double setback.While Wijk is nearing its end, the Gibraltar Masters, one of the world’s strongest opens, has just got under way. The top seeds Shak Mamedyarov and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave have already dropped half points.China’s Ju Wenjun retained her women’s world championship on Friday when she defeated her Russian challenger Aleksandra Goryachkina by 2.5-1.5 in a rapid chess tie-break after their classical series, played in Shanghai and Vlaostok, was tied at 6-6. The prize fund of €500,000 was a record for the women’s title.They were evenly matched, and the lead changed hands several times in a fluctuating contest. Ju Wenjun was more experienced in rapid chess and she won well in the decisive tie-breaker."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de07980611672f47c5ca3d9dece57a46ad26ce71/0_235_4147_2489/master/4147.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1eb1c0780ca7ce723d39d6aad1428002","title":"coco gauff shocks naomi osaka reach last 16 australian open tennis","story":"• Venus Williams says ‘sky’s limit’ for precocious teenager • Greatest achievement for player doing high school lessonsThere is precocious composure and there is Coco Gauff. It is difficult to recall a teenager thrown into the klieg lights of global sporting celebrity so comfortable with praise yet unfailingly polite and brimming with such self-belief. Anyone who moves into her ambit would think the same: is she too good to be true?Certainly, she was too good for Naomi Osaka here on Friday night. In an hour and seven minutes she destroyed the defending champion for the loss of seven games. No mountain is safe. Ask Venus Williams, who won four of her seven slams before Gauff was born, but could not take a set off her in two matches in slams, most recently here this week.“She clearly wants it, works very hard, is extremely mature for her age,” the elder Wllliams sister said. “I think the sky’s the limit for her.”And maybe ask Serena Williams. It is hard not to wonder about a power shift in the sport when a 38-year-old legend loses on the same day a 15-year-old newcomer becomes the youngest woman to beat a top-five opponent at this level since Jennifer Capriati did it against world No 3 Gabriela Sabatini in the quarter-finals of the 1991 US Open.“She’s definitely impressive all around, from her personality to the way she plays,” Williams said earlier in the week. “I think it’s just all super impressive. I was nowhere near her level at 15 – either on the court or off the court, not even close. I know kids are growing up different nowadays, so I’m not sure. But I was nowhere near as, like, smart and eloquent as she is. It’s nice to see.”Osaka, still only 22, is genius cut from different cloth. Although similarly empathetic and hugely thoughtful, she has a habit of thinking sideways. She wonders if she is, “champion material”, yet – even though she has won two slams. When asked in the tender moments after losing what her own expectations were at Gauff’s age, she did not seem to make the prodigy connection, or see its relevance.“My expectations when I was 15? Like, what do you mean? Same thing as I am right now. I thought I’d be here sooner, though.”Osaka was only a few years older than Gauff is now when she won the first of her slams, that boiling New York night in 2018 when Williams self-combusted in defeat. And then she arrived here a year ago and won her second slam in a row, rising to No 1 in the world – before saying goodbye to the coach who had helped her get there.It would seem the sport will be entertained and perplexed for years to come by these two unique and very different iniduals, polar opposites in personality but sharing the same ambitions – and no doubt, the same courts from Melbourne to New York to Paris to Wimbledon. It is a comforting thought at the end of one era and the beginning of the next. Records will tumble for both of them the way they have done for Serena Williams.Already Gauff has us reaching for statistics every time she moves like a cat through the draw. She arrived this week ranked 67 in the world a year ago, she was at 684. Who is to say she will not be in the top 10 when she returns – or sooner?Gauff’s tennis is so good, so simply smart and effective, her athleticism so easy and her balance such a fit for her sport, that it is tempting to take it for granted as the points fall her way – like we came to do with Williams. Against Osaka, she bided her time to perfection in the first set, finally opening her shoulders to send a thumping message that she was in for a much rougher ride than when they last met.After half an hour, the kid was a set up and flying. When she broke the other kid twice in the second after an early trade, she was poised for the kill. Gauff’s game was as solid as a rock, her mind clear. Osaka, serving to stay in the conversation, was mentally spent. In a deadly finish, Gauff completed a run of 13 unanswered service points in a row, and finished the job when Osaka shoved her closing forehand into the middle of the net.“I don’t know where that came from – maybe the crowd?” Gauff said courtside, to wild cheering.”What is my life like? Two years ago, I lost here first round in juniors, and now I’m here on Rod Laver Arena. This is crazy. I can’t believe this. I walked past him a couple of times in the corridor but I never stopped and talked. I need a selfie for Instagram. Probably I’ll do more homework tomorrow, but I want to sleep tonight. My teachers are giving me some time, under the circumstances.”What circumstances they are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daccc5161929275c6853652cb195a92f192e7bf1/0_214_7788_4673/master/7788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59464d70a24029e9cb793258ccd903b4","title":"hard challenging sport inside the world of competitive cheerleading","story":"A new Netflix series comes amid an explosion of interest in the activity in the UKLizzie Williams describes watching Netflix’s new cheerleading documentary, Cheer, as surreal. It was the first time the 26-year-old British cheerleader had seen an accurate portrayal of her sport – its mechanically precise choreography, the gravity-defying tumbling, and the sheer grit required to push past exhaustion.The six-part documentary, which aired this month, follows cheerleading champions from Navarro College in Texas as they defended their national title. It has been warmly welcomed by elite cheerleaders and coaches in the UK for putting their sport centre stage – and pushing past the idea that it’s all big grins and miniskirts.“Most people see the sideline cheer they see the pom-poms and dance side of it. They don’t understand all-star cheerleading exists and that it is a hard and challenging sport to compete in,” Williams, said while practising with the Unity Allstars Black team in south London. The group, which competes on the same level as Navarro, was placed seventh in the world last year.The series premiered as interest in cheerleading has exploded in the UK. Tori Rubin, the co-manager of the England cheerleading team and co-owner of Unity Allstar, said she started the company in 2006 with one team, but the gym now boasts 23 teams. The trend is echoed across the country, with an estimated 60,000 athletes competing at regional and national level.“It’s a great sport because it’s teamwork, it’s all about athletes working together in unison to create something spectacular. I used to be a gymnast and the thing I found really difficult was the inidual nature of the sport,” Rubin said. She praised the documentary for showing the athleticism required to be a competitive cheerleader. “It’s very similar to our practices. It’s indicative of what cheerleading is about it’s tough, it’s hard, but once you’re in it you’re obsessed.”While Unity AllStar Black is the only UK team that can compete at the same level as Navarro, the sport has developed rapidly across the country. “When I first got involved with the sport 15 years ago it was, in essence, mums with kids learning things from YouTube and books and competing with other mums with kids and pushing mats together,” said Joanna Gamper Cuthbert, the chair of SportCheer England, the national governing body for cheerleading in England. She added that teams have been able to dramatically increase their skill level because of the better training and education.Amanda Fairhall, the events director of Future Cheers, one of the country’s largest cheer competition organisers, said while US teams dominate the sport, “the gulf between us and the Americans has started to close”. She added: “The teams we send to compete in world championships are competing with the best of the best and holding their own.”Navarro’s long road to becoming national champions is littered with broken bones, blood and tears. Williams does not shy away from the risk that comes with being a competitive cheerleader, but said: “If you trust your bases that takes away a lot of the fear factor. If they trust you to do your job and you trust them to do their job, then you’ve got the confidence to go for the skill that is scary to begin with.”The documentary has also received critical acclaim for its representation of male cheerleaders. Tyla Cousins, 21, who has been a cheerleader for nine years, said: “It’s still at that stage where I have to explain to my dad’s friends that it doesn’t include pom-poms. So for the people that don’t actually understand the sport, the documentary allows people to get to have a little view of what you do.”Cousins, who has previously broken his ankle in four places and cracked a rib, added it was not difficult to get people to understand the stamina required to take part.As awareness of the sport grows, children are being drawn in at a younger age. Reanne Snagg drives eight-year old Mya Benjamin-Clarke more than an hour to Unity Allstar’s gym to train. Mya goes four times a week for gymnastics, acrobatics, tumbling, and flying lessons. While Snagg loves seeing Mya become a more confident child, she admits it can be nerve-racking to watch as a parent. “When they’re flying, they do go very high and as a mother you can’t help but think, ‘Oh my God please catch my child!’”To sustain the interest of the growing number of girls and boys who want to take part in the sport, the cheer community needs money. “Sport England recognition would mean our grassroots community programmes would have access to funding that’s ringfenced for sport,” Gamper Cuthbert explained. The funding would also support the pioneering work already done in the inclusion of disabled athletes in cheerleading.SportCheer England, which operates on “glitter and a prayer”, is determined to not only get recognition from Sport England, but to see the sport on the Olympic stage.It’s a dream that many hope to see realised at Unity AllStars. But, for now, the athletes remain focused on completing their routine without a single mistake. It’s brutal and exhausting work that takes its toll. As the Black team gets ready to go again, they cheer each other on as Rubin shouts: “If you think you are tired, remember you’re not tired.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68c1cc1cda9f7bdef863fcf9780ca6207fc3f3db/0_120_4866_2919/master/4866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25623fa0da55e90e28bc959c2eabdc38","title":"south africa v england fourth test day one live","story":"Mid-28th over: England 88-0 (Crawley 56, Sibley 29) At last, a well-aimed bouncer from SA, bowled by the pacey Nortje. It’s rather too well-aimed for Crawley, who plays a hook, misses, and takes a blow flush on the helmet, above his eyes. He’s still standing, and seems OK, but there’s a delay for the usual concussion tests. “You seem to be forgetting,” says Paul Haynes, “that most of us have no access to viewing the cricket, which is why we follow it via your live reporting. Exciting cricket is terrible, as we non-viewers are missing out on the action, but if it’s a bit boring, then the investment of refreshing or checking every 10 minutes gets a fair return. A boring century is thus better for the OBO enthusiast who doesn’t need to watch it. Personally, apart from the 2019 World Cup final, I haven’t seen a game of cricket since 2005!” That is quite a record.27th over: England 88-0 (Crawley 56, Sibley 29) Beuran Hendricks returns after making a decent start to his Test career with the new ball. But he too comes bearing gifts – a half-volley which Crawley punches back past him with great confidence, and a short one which Crawley can’t quite time or place. If he had played the pull as crisply as the drive, he’d be on 80 by now. 26th over: England 83-0 (Crawley 51, Sibley 29) A couple of singles off Nortje, whose over ends with Sibley taking a nip-backer in the groin. He winces, and the whole world winces with him.25th over: England 81-0 (Crawley 50, Sibley 28) Sibley celebrates his mate’s landmark with an on-drive for four as Pretorius gets too floaty again. One of the hopeful signs for this new-look England is the pleasure they take in each other’s achievements. Sibley and Crawley will soon be competing for one slot as Burns’s opening partner, but they’re not letting that get in the way of the team’s interests.Zak Crawley goes to his first Test fifty with a single to backward point off Pretorius. It was a leading edge, so perhaps his worst shot of the day. More importantly, he has nine fours and “has got his tempo spot-on,” as Nasser says. And he won’t be 22 till next week.24th over: England 75-0 (Crawley 49, Sibley 23) Nortje goes wide on the crease and beats Sibley, poking uncertainly at a lifter. When you see Sibley play outside off stump, you wonder how on earth he managed to score a Test century.23rd over: England 74-0 (Crawley 49, Sibley 23) And... ACTION! Pretorius, who has at least been frugal so far, suddenly hands out some freebies. Crawley thumps one half-volley through the covers, another past midwicket, and a third back past the bowler. The second one took Crawley to 45, his highest Test score. He just keeps going up, so no wonder he likes it at altitude. “Over 18, Dane and Dwaine bowling together...” says Dan Silk. “Please say they’re bowling dibbly-dobblies? At the very least we need Dwaine’s Dibbly.”22nd over: England 62-0 (Crawley 37, Sibley 23) Back comes Anrich Nortje, after a bad start and a stint on the Nortje step. He does better, stringing a few dots together and then squeezing a semi-false stroke out of Sibley, who fends awkwardly close to gully and gets a streaky four.“I’m sure,” says Alan Shillitoe, “there’s a Red Dwarf joke to be had from Dwaine-Sibley somewhere, but I can’t quite find it!”21st over: England 57-0 (Crawley 36, Sibley 19) An edge! As Paterson bowls Crawley something resembling a leg-cutter, and it doesn’t carry to slip. Both the ball, and the stroke, could have been flown in from Port Elizabeth. Crawley then takes another single with a pull, to round off the most exciting over I’ve covered today.20th over: England 56-0 (Crawley 35, Sibley 19) Another single for Crawley. That’s 19 off the last ten overs, following 37 off the first 10. We may have a new world record time for a Test match going to sleep.19th over: England 55-0 (Crawley 34, Sibley 19) Paterson gets away with a half-tracker to Crawley, who can only help it round the corner for a single. SA have managed to dry up the scoring, but what they really need is a wicket.18th over: England 54-0 (Crawley 33, Sibley 19) A change at the other end as Pretorius replaces Philander. It’s a maiden, to Sibley, but more interestingly we have a Dane and a Dwaine bowling together. And neither has a middle name. 17th over: England 54-0 (Crawley 33, Sibley 19) Faf sticks with Dane Paterson, who has been doing Philander’s job for him, landing the ball on a length. But now he drops short and Zak Crawley cashes in with a cut for four. Paterson responds well, with a jaffa that goes just past the outside edge. England could easily be 44 for three. Thanks Rob, afternoon everyone. Well, this is a funny one – two rookie openers finding it easy against the great Vernon Philander on his favourite surface. Perhaps he’s got something in his eye.That’s it from me. Tim de Lisle will be with you for the rest of the day – you can email him on tim.delisle.casual@the or tweet @TimdeLisle. Thanks for your company, bye!16th over: England 50-0 (Crawley 29, Sibley 19) Sibley plays the shot of the day so far, driving Philander emphatically to the left of mid-on for four. The next delivery hits the seam and snaps past the outside edge. A good comeback from Philander, but the first hour and a bit belonged to England. That’s drinks.15th over: England 44-0 (Crawley 29, Sibley 13) A rare loose stroke from Crawley, who fishes outside off at Paterson and is beaten. He knew it was a nothing shot before he had finished playing it. A maiden.14th over: England 44-0 (Crawley 29, Sibley 13) England’s openers have been able to leave a lot of deliveries with confidence, which is unusual against Philander in particular. 13th over: England 42-0 (Crawley 28, Sibley 12) Dane Paterson replaces Anrich Nortje, whose two overs were slapped for 16 by Zak Crawley. He finds a bit of movement away from Crawley, who is content to let everything pass outside off stump. He’s played seriously well so far.“Greetings Rob,” says Sam. “Wondering what your thoughts are on Burns’ return once fit? Crawley looks okay to me (cue mockers) and should he have a decent tour in Sri Lanka he could cause a few headaches around the selection table. Full disclosure, I’m a big fan of Burns. I’d actually have him as skipper and allow Root his head. Whaddyareckon?”I’d just let it play out and review everything when Burns is available. They also have the option of putting Zak Crawley at No3 if they want. My hunch is that one of Crawley, Sibley and Denly will have a bit of a beast in Sri Lanka, which will make it easier to decide who to leave out when Burns is available.12th over: England 42-0 (Crawley 28, Sibley 12) Vernon Philander returns for his second spell, this time at the other end - and Sibley is caught off a no-ball. Oh, Vern. It was the correct decision, bravely called on the field by Joel Wilson.11th over: England 41-0 (Crawley 28, Sibley 12) Crawley plays another superb stroke, clipping Nortje between midwicket and mid-on for four. Even after 11 overs, South Africa urgently need a wicket.10th over: England 37-0 (Crawley 24, Sibley 12) Hendricks moves round the wicket in an attempt to make Sibley play at more deliveries. He achieves that but not much else. South Africa are struggling here. The pitch is doing much less than expected.“Rob,” says Brian Withington, “Call me a sentimental old git, but isn’t there something life-affirmingly wonderful about watching (and hearing) genuine cover drives by the likes of young Crawley and Pope?”Damn straight. I’m welling up over here. 9th over: England 37-0 (Crawley 24, Sibley 12) Anrich Nortje replaces Vernon Philander, who bowled a surprisingly tame opening spell of 4-0-12-0. The impressive Crawley crumps his first delivery through midwicket for four - and then drives the fourth ball emphatically to the cover boundary. As England opening batsmen go, he’s very watchable. This has been an almost perfect start for England.8th over: England 25-0 (Crawley 13, Sibley 11) “I could watch Curtly bowl all day,” says Chris Drew. “Watch as in from a long way away.”South Africa thought he had given a catch behind when he flicked at a delivery outside leg stump from Hendricks. The umpire Joel Wilson agreed, but Sibley reviewed straight away and replays showed he didn’t touch it.ENGLAND REVIEW! Sibley has been given out caught behind off Hendricks.7th over: England 21-0 (Crawley 12, Sibley 8) Crawley has punched some handsome drives off Philander, which is either brave or foolhardy. I’ll let you know in a couple of hours’ time. Thus far he has batted with eyecatching authority, and he gets his second boundary with a dismissive extra-cover drive.6th over: England 15-0 (Crawley 6, Sibley 8) Sibley gurns as Hendricks runs in to bowl: short, slightly wide and forced through backward point for four. Good shot. South Africa have bowled far too short this morning, Hendricks in particular, and that has helped England get off to an encouraging start. These six overs have surely confirmed that it’s a case of when, not if, England usurp India as the world’s No1 Test team.“Looking forward to seeing how Root does against the debutant bowler,” begins Matt Dony, sniggering at a punchline he hasn’t even delivered yet. “Hopefully there’ll be a bit of chat on the pitch. I think we all want to hear ‘Hey, Joe’ from Hendricks. I’m here all week. Try the Koeksister.”5th over: England 11-0 (Crawley 6, Sibley 4) By Philander’s immaculate standards, this has been a slightly loose opening spell. He pitches one up to Crawley, who laces a sweet drive through mid-off for four. Crawley has started beautifully, both in defence and attack.4th over: England 7-0 (Crawley 2, Sibley 4) That’s better from Hendricks, a fuller delivery that beats Sibley outside off stump. There’s decent carry in this pitch, which can sometimes seduce people into bowling too short. Better to bowl what Sir Curtly Ambrose called the Perth-fect length.Here’s more on the news that Jofra Archer failed a fitness test this morning3rd over: England 7-0 (Crawley 2, Sibley 4) Crawley leaves a ball from Philander that snaps off the seam to hit him on the pad. It was a safe enough leave on length, though the seam movement may unnerve the England openers. A better over from Philander, who is getting closer to off stump. Crawley’s defensive strokes were also very positive.This is another great spot from an ersthwhile OBOer.2nd over: England 6-0 (Crawley 2, Sibley 4) The left-arm seamer Beuran Hendricks, making his Test debut, will share the new ball on his home ground. He’s a little short, for the most part, and Sibley gets going with a flick off the hip for four.Meanwhile, this is a good point from Chris Parker: both Dom Bess and Keshav Maharaj have been dropped despite taking five-fors in the last Test. I wonder when that last happened.1st over: England 1-0 (Crawley 1, Sibley 0) Crawley drags an inside-edge through square leg to get England off the mark. Sibley then survives a big shout for LBW after pushing outside the line of a nice nipbacker. It was far too high, and Faf du Plessis had no interest in a review.“I can’t help but feel England are asking for a little bit of trouble with their selection today,” says James Matthews. “Yes, it’s a fast track (by all accounts), but with Wood not having played back to back tests for 18 months and Stokes’ workload already being mountainous, they could find themselves ruing the lack of Dom Bess to hold down an end for 35 overs and give the seamers a breather. Yes, Root’s bowling is improved, but he’s nonetheless far from being a frontline spin option.”Agreed. I can understand the decision, as slow bowler tend to do very little at Jo’burg, but it’s always a risk to leave out the spinner. I never did get over Headingley 89.Here we go. Vernon Philander to Zak Crawley.I think England have made the right decision at the toss, but batting will not be easy this afternoon. There should be enough nip and carry for Vernon Philander to be a handful.“Joe Root has confirmed that Joe Root will be unavailable?” sniffs Robert Darby.Sorry, I had Joe Root on the brain. I’ve changed it now to the correct name, Martin McCague.Both teams have gone in with five seamers and no full-time spinner. Joe Root confirms that Jofra Archer is unavailable because of his elbow problem, so England make only one change: Chris Woakes for Dom Bess.South Africa bring in the left-arm seamer Beuran Hendricks for his Test debut, one of three changes from the team that lost at Port Elizabeth. Temba Bavuma and Dwaine Pretorius return, with Zubayr Hamza, Keshav Maharaj and the suspended Kagiso Rabada missing out.Joe Root cites the cracks in this pitch, and his unsuccessful decision to bowl first at Centurion, as the main reasons for batting first. “I banked on losing the toss,” says Faf du Plessis, who has now lost seven in a row. He says he would probably have bowled first.Play will start at 1.20pm local time (11.20am GMT), with the toss at 1pm.While we’re down the YouTube rabbit hole...

But they have long been plagued by sluggishness, poor battery life and a software experience that is behind the competition.Fossil Group, which includes the signature Fossil brand and many others such as Michael Kors, Diesel, Misfit and Skagen, has been making the best of Wear OS, but often that simply hasn’t been good enough.Fossil’s fifth-generation smartwatch, the Gen 5, is important for the whole of Wear OS, as its internal workings will also form the basis of all of Fossil Group’s various smartwatches this year.The Gen 5 is a good-looking watch in its own right, with various different colours, finishes and straps available. It doesn’t immediately scream that it’s a piece of technology, which is a good thing.At 12mm thick and 44mm wide the watch isn’t small, but it looks fairly slim, easily fits under a shirt cuff and doesn’t look out of place on relatively small wrists.The 1.28in AMOLED screen is crisp, clear and bright enough to see in direct sunlight with automatic adjustment. It’s on all the time by default so you can see the time and notifications at a glance.Fossil provides loads of highly customisable watch faces, most of which look really good, plus there are hundreds more on the Play Store. There’s a speaker hole in one side of the watch with two buttons that launch your choice of apps and one rotating crown on the other.As a watch, then, it ticks most boxes.The Gen 5 manages to banish the issues of poor performance and battery life of Wear OS to the past. Performance is good, if not quite on par with the Apple Watch Series 5, with no noticeable lag or dip in speed in general usage, helped by the 1GB of RAM and newer Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor.The “Extended” battery mode, which turns off some of the features including the always-on screen, lasts more than two days between charges, while time-only mode lasts much longer still.Charging takes just over an hour via the small white magnetic USB puck that attaches to a ring to the back.It’s worth noting that while the watch comes with a two-year warranty, Fossil said the battery cannot be replaced, meaning the watch is ultimately disposable.Wear OS has improved over the last year, but simply isn’t as feature-complete or as slick as Apple’s watchOS or Samsung’s Tizen on their respective watches.You navigate via swipes on the screen. Left to right for Google Assistant. Right to left for various widgets for things such as timers, Google Fit and others called Tiles. Swipe up from the bottom for notifications and other bits. Swipe down from the top for quick settings, such as airplane mode, volume, battery modes and Google Pay. Long-press on the watch face to change it.Press the crown in to access a list of apps or go back to the watch face. Swipe from left to right typically works as the back button on Android. It’s fairly simple and easy to get the hang of.Notification handling is where Wear OS shines. Notifications pop up from the bottom and can be dismissed, expanded to read the text of emails or WhatsApps, or actioned with the same options as available via the notification shade on your phone such as archiving with Gmail or similar.You can reply to messages using smart canned responses, your voice to transcribe, or with the surprisingly good keyboard which, while fiddly, gets the job done for quick things even if you’re a bit fat-fingered.Media controls are also great. Start playing something on your phone and they pop up on the watch to skip track or change the volume using the crown. There’s a dedicated Spotify app too, but it won’t allow you to store music offline – for that you have to resort to Google’s Play Music app.Popular third-party apps such as Strava and Citymapper are available through the store, while Google’s services are well catered for with Maps, Translate, Fit and others available.Long-press on the crown or a swipe from left to right on the watch face to get to Google Assistant, which will set timers, alarms, reminders and answer questions via voice straight from the watch using the built-in speaker and information on the screen. It works well, as long as you have a connection to your phone.Wear OS on the Gen 5 is the best it ever has been. But it’s certainly not a perfect experience. The setup process failed once on one of the watches, requiring a reset and starting again. Occasionally the watch disconnects from the phone and the only way to get it working again is to reboot it.The rotating crown scrolls in apps and settings, except when it doesn’t. Some apps such as Spotify refuse input from the crown, others such as face editing settings or Google Fit only work sometimes. It’s unpredictable enough that you just resort to swiping on the screen instead by default. The list of little niggles goes on. They’re not deal breakers, but each is annoying.It’s also worth noting that Fossil also will not commit to a set length of software support for the Gen 5.The biggest area of weakness in Wear OS is its built-in health tracking related functionality or lack thereof. Google Fit is the main app here. It can count your steps, movement minutes and “heart points” just fine, it monitors your heart rate in the background occasionally, and will guide you through breathing to destress.But the Fit app doesn’t do much beyond the basics, not even sleep monitoring. It can track a lot of workouts, but the screens it displays for things such as running aren’t customisable. Using it for tracking workouts also affects battery life, particularly if you’re playing music to Bluetooth headphones while running.Third-party fitness apps such as Strava, which is simple but effective, may fill the gap for specific functions. Nike Run Club and Cardiogram also come pre-installed.Overall, Google is miles behind both Apple and Samsung, let alone the likes of Fitbit or Garmin, in features and polish on health tracking and analysis, and Wear OS suffers as a result.The Fossil Gen 5 comes in two versions: Carlyle HR and Julianna HR, both costing £279.The Fossil Gen 5 is easily the best Wear OS watch available and bodes well for the rest of the brands within Fossil Group’s roster.It relegates problems with performance and sub-day battery life to the past, and looks good doing it. If you want your smartwatch to look like a more traditional timepiece the Fossil is great.But Wear OS just isn’t as polished or feature-packed as rivals from Apple and Samsung. Use the Gen 5 as a basic smartwatch with excellent notification handling and music controls and you’ll be happy. Try to get comprehensive health tracking and advanced features and you might struggle.Will it beat an Apple Watch Series 5? Not a chance. But one of the Gen 5’s biggest strengths is that it isn’t an Apple Watch so you’re not going to see every person in the room wearing the same watch as you. It’s also at least £120 cheaper.If you want a good-looking smartwatch that doesn’t follow the crowd and ticks enough boxes to be a replacement for a traditional digital or analogue timepiece, then the Fossil Gen 5 in its various guises is worth considering. Particularly on a deal.Pros: looks like a watch, not as common as an Apple Watch, works with both Android and iOS, good notification and music controls, Google Pay, speaker, 30-metre water resistance, at least one day’s battery, third-party app support, standard 22mm straps.Cons: health tracking not as comprehensive as competitors, battery life not as good as competitors, software niggles persist, iMessage support lacking on iOS.

Actually, it’s more of a ledge beneath a craggy, overhanging limestone rock. Yet, in the summer of 1898 the 16-year-old Picasso and a friend spent a month sleeping here: in the Santa Bárbara mountain in the Terres de l’Ebre region of Catalonia, some 210km south-west of Barcelona. He would later write: “Everything I know, I learned in Horta.”Local lore has turned the ledge into a cave but, either way, it’s certainly remote – high up amid the dense holly oak and pine forests of the mountains. Apart from the odd derelict farmhouse, there was nothing for miles and all I heard were warbling sparrows and the trickling of a brook.The answer to why Picasso came here lies with his friend Manuel Pallarès, a fellow pupil at the School of Fine Arts in Barcelona, who had invited him to spend the summer at his family home in the hilltop village of Horta (now Horta de Sant Joan). The boys decided to escape the summer heat by heading to the mountains and they spent August drawing and painting the landscape while Pallarès’s sister would bring provisions on a donkey every few days.Several of the works Picasso created in Horta will be on show at Picasso and Paper, a new exhibition at London’s Royal Academy, which opens on 25 January. Among them will be a prodigiously accomplished drawing of a local village girl. There are also some of Picasso’s early forays into cubism, which he began experimenting with on his second trip to Horta 11 years later, accompanied by his then lover Fernande Olivier.To a city boy like Picasso, raised in Málaga, A Coruña and Barcelona, the countryside in one of the furthest flung corners of Catalonia must have seemed like the end of the Earth. As I drove from Barcelona, the motorway cut through the dramatic limestone gorges of the Serra de Llaberia mountains, with no villages in sight for over an hour and a half. Eventually, a steep, winding, mountain road edged its way past vineyards, olive groves, almond trees and rust-coloured rocks to the walled, medieval village of Horta de Sant Joan.Despite narrow streets, pretty, cloistered plazas and a slow pace to life, this is not an area much visited by tourists and walking into the Bar La Bassa on the square I got a few stranger-in-town stares from the elderly gents playing cards inside. Yet Horta is now part of a Picasso Route taking in the main places he stayed in and visited – in the village itself, as well as the nearby mountains. The starting point is the Centre Picasso museum, where I saw copies of the drawings and paintings Picasso created in the area, including wonderful sketches of village women washing their laundry in the streams and his cubist views of the Santa Bárbara mountain, memorably merged with the face of Olivier.On the Plaza de Misa, the facade of the pension where Picasso and Olivier stayed was unchanged. The story goes that the deeply traditional villagers were so outraged by the idea of an unmarried couple openly sharing a room that they began throwing stones at their window. Picasso apparently responded by storming onto the balcony and firing a pistol into the air. There’s also a mirador (viewing point) on the edge of the village that provided me a head-on view of the Santa Bárbara mountain, recognisable from Picasso’s paintings, despite his cubist deconstruction.To me, what was most impressive was the rural landscape of the Els Ports mountains in which Santa Bárbara sits – now a natural park. This is fantastic countryside for walking, cycling or a leisurely drive and, as well as the “cave”, it’s also possible to visit sites that Picasso painted, including the medieval Convent de Sant Salvador, with its beautiful Renaissance cloister.The Picasso Route can be explored in a day but there are plenty of other things to see in the area. The town of Gandesa – about 30 minutes’ drive north-east – has a wine-making cooperative in a vast, turreted art nouveau “wine cathedral” and tours can booked of its interior. There’s also the impressive Centre d’Estudis de la Batalla de l’Ebre, a museum dedicated to one of the defining events of the Spanish civil war – the Battle of the Ebro – with interactive displays and powerful filmed interviews with survivors.Horta is the kind of place which, if it were better-known, would be overrun with coach parties. Mercifully, it’s not and, on a clear day, as I looked out to the Santa Bárbara mountain, I got a sense of the paradise Picasso once found.The trip was assisted by Catalunya and Terres de L’Ebre tourist boards.

A paper submitted to the synod says all parts of the church must take action or “ramp up what they are already doing”.First meeting in its current format in 1970, the General Synod of the Church of England sets the rules and legislation for the running of the church. There are usually two or three synodical sessions per year, which are officially opened by the monarch.The synod has three houses and there are currently 467 members.The House of Bishops consists of all 42 bishops in the Church of England. They are joined by nine suffragan bishops.\u0026nbspThe House of Clergy comprises ordained church members below the rank of bishop. They are elected every five years by their fellow clergy to represent their inidual Dioceses.The House of Laity\u0026nbspcomprises of unordained members of the church who are indirectly elected every 5 years. Each diocese is represented by two members.The main functions of the General Synod are to pass measures dealing with the government of the church and its institutions, and to pass canons, which determine doctrine and the permitted forms of worship.The church must “begin by getting our own house in order”, and although the paper says there are excellent initiatives, “the overall picture remains patchy”.It gives examples such as switching to LED lighting, moving away from gas and oil to green electricity as the source of heat, using electric rather than petrol or diesel vehicles, and encouraging bioersity in churchyards and glebe land.“We would need to think about our international travel, recognising that there are very strong connections with the rest of the world but also developing ways of nurturing those relationships which are more sustainable, and offsetting flights when necessary,” it says.He said the environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion had been “brilliant” at forcing the climate crisis on to the global agenda.“The Church of England has buildings in every architectural style and material from the past 1,500 years, posing some unique challenges when it comes to energy efficiency,” he said.“However, churches are not museums they are living buildings which serve their communities every day of the week, and being greener isn’t about doing less, it’s about equipping parishes to get smarter about energy consumption.“Setting a net zero target of 2045, five years ahead of the government’s target, would nonetheless represent a significant statement of intent by General Synod, one which will require innovation, faith and dedication from our churches, schools, and communities.“Christians are called to safeguard God’s creation and sustain and renew the life of the Earth. Faced with the reality of catastrophic climate change, which will affect the world’s most vulnerable people the soonest, radical and immediate action is our only option.”However, Christian Aid said the C of E should go further, pointing out that the National Farmers’ Union is planning for its entire sector to be net zero by 2040, and the UK water industry by 2030.“On matters of morality and injustice, the church should be at the forefront, modelling a prophetic vision that gives hope to the poor and voiceless,” said Patrick Watt, the charity’s director of policy and public affairs. “People suffering at the hands of the climate crisis in the global south, including millions of Christian sisters and brothers, need institutions in the rich world to move rapidly to cut emissions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97402865bdd16e77264e3ae8c842f5be30853b69/0_266_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50e7a509b38ac66b4a19e16e90db2b5e","title":"helen mirren profoundly moved by reconstruction of anne franks room","story":"Oscar-winning actor presents documentary retracing life of Jewish teenager killed by the NazisShe has performed on countless film sets, but Dame Helen Mirren was “profoundly moved” by the latest one: a reconstruction of the claustrophobic Amsterdam apartment in which Jewish teenager Anne Frank hid for two years from the Nazis with her family until she was arrested in 1944 and sent to her death in a concentration camp.The Oscar-winning actor is presenting a documentary, to be released in cinemas on Monday, in which Frank’s life is retraced through the pages of her diary, a classic of war literature.Within Frank’s reconstructed apartment, Mirren reads diary entries, including one dated 15 July 1944. Frank wrote: “I feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when I look up at the sky, I somehow feel that everything will change for the better, that this cruelty too will end, that peace and tranquillity will return once more …”Weeks later, the teenager was arrested and deported, dying from typhus in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany in February 1945.Mirren says in the documentary: “She disappeared along with one and a half million other kids and teens like her.”The documentary is directed by Sabina Fedeli and Anna Migotto, who worked with set designers from the Piccolo theatre in Milan and the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam in reconstructing the apartment and “the sense of claustrophobia and oppression experienced by Anne”.Fedeli said: “Mirren had already visited the Amsterdam shelter, an empty house, without furniture and without furnishings, as decided by Otto Frank, Anne’s father, in memory of the 6 million deaths of the Shoah.“Instead, we have reconstructed the room as it was in 1942, when Anne lived there, with her bed, the desk, her objects.”The documentary Anne Frank: Parallel Stories includes the moving accounts of five other women who, as young girls, were also deported to concentration camps but survived the Holocaust.In the podcast interview, Mirren talks about wanting the film-makers to make a feature film on Frank: “I think the time is right.”She believes that, with immigration becoming such an important issue in the 21st century, Frank’s story is all the more important.Mirren won the best actress Oscar for her performance in The Queen.Asked about her historical-based productions, she says: “Truth is stranger than fiction … Human history endlessly teaches us about ourselves.”• Anne Frank: Parallel Stories will be released in cinemas on Monday, marking 75 years since the end of the Holocaust. The podcast interview with Mirren is on My Cineplace’s Monthly Movie Show, available on Spotify and iTunes.

But there were no attempts on Friday morning to attack government buildings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7537c9c3b123f060d22185bc4302e6f7ff3b1e0f/0_49_1439_863/master/1439.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa46da827f8fcad04a1373867a5909ba","title":"aiming for the stars how new zealands space industry is causing turbulence","story":"The once-sleepy Mahia peninsula is now the site of regular rocket launches but a plan to put US spy satellites into space is causing concernLife on the Mahia peninsula on New Zealand’s North Island used to be quiet: surfing beaches, historical monuments, and good snapper fishing.Then space came to town.Four years ago Rocketlab’s Peter Beck was searching for somewhere for his launch pad. He wanted to privatise rocket launches, taking them out of the hands of behemoth governments in Russia, the US and China.Beck scoured the US – and the world – until eventually turning his gaze back home.Before Rocketlab, New Zealand had no space industry to speak of but a night sky famous for its clarity.“We’re able to launch at a frequency rate which is unmatched anywhere in the world,” says Beck of his Launch Complex 1 pad where 47 rockets have been launched and expansion plans are afoot.“New Zealand is not a small player in the industry any more – it’s the fourth largest player in the world.”New Zealand’s remote geographical location gives the country clear skies and seas, low levels of air and shipping traffic, and one of the largest selections of launch angles in the world.These ideal technical conditions, transparent business environment and a friendly government are creating a buzz in the global space industry.“Two years ago we had a hard time getting anyone to take us seriously,” says Dr Peter Crabtree, director of New Zealand’s space agency, launched in 2016, and operating on a budget of just NZ$3m a year.“There was this sense that we weren’t credible.“Now we’re being asked by other governments: ‘How can New Zealand be involved in trips to the moon and expeditions to Mars?’”The financial incentive for the industry to thrive is strong as sheep and dairy farming become increasingly unpopular.“New Zealand is extremely well placed to increase its share in the NZ$647bn global space economy,” the economic minister, Phil Twyford, said recently. Talks are under way with local universities to recruit and prepare students for local space jobs because the main thing holding the industry back is talent, insiders say. Last year New Zealand launched the same number of rockets as Japan, India and Europe, making it a major player fast, says Dan Ceperley, founder of the Silicon Valley start-up LeoLabs.“There’s so much buzz around about New Zealand now – there’s real talk that they could become world leaders,” he says.His company recently built a radar on a sheep station in the South Island to track space debris.“The New Zealand space agency have been quite transformative. They are nimble and innovative in their thinking and there is a willingness to discuss new ideas, and that’s not something you get everywhere.”But there are growing murmurs of disquiet.Although New Zealand’s space agency has positioned itself as the most “sustainable” and peaceful player in the game, it has also allowed Rocketlab to launch satellites and carry payloads for the US defence department, including its spy agencies.This week Rocketlab announced its first launch of 2020 would be for the US national reconnaissance office, which operates the government’s intelligence-gathering satellites.In a statement the company said the payload of the launch – dubbed Birds of a Feather – was “classified” but “NRO data is used to inform decision-making by national policymakers and military and civil users in the US and in US partner nations, including New Zealand”.The Green party says it is “concerned” about the launch, especially as tensions with Iran rise, and the director of New Zealand’s centre for peace and conflict studies, Prof Kevin Clements, says he is “alarmed” as New Zealand has no real control over what the US intelligence satellite reconnaissance could be used for.“While these rocket launches are not delivering weapons into space they are playing an absolutely critical role in enhancing the surveillance and intelligence systems for space-based nuclear warfare,” he says.“They make us complicit in Donald Trump’s desire for a ‘military space force’. I think they challenge the spirit of our anti-nuclear legislation and tie us ever closer into our alliance with the United States.”Beck told the  his company was interested in using space as a force for good and “our moral compass in the company is very strong. We … go to space to improve life on Earth.”But it is not the only Rocketlab project that has prompted a strong public backlash.In early 2018 the company launched the “humanity star”, variously described as a “giant disco ball”, a “Christmas tree bauble” and “a gesture of hubris”.Beck said the star would be brightest object in the night sky for nine months until it re-entered Earth’s atmosphere, and was designed to be seen around the globe as a “reminder to all on Earth about our fragile place in the universe”.But the move angered astrophystics: “Wow. Intentionally bright long-term space graffiti. Thanks a lot @RocketLab,” a California Institute of Technology astronomer, Mike Brown, wrote on Twitter.In New Zealand the humanity star was described by many as “space junk” and a glib use of space and technology.Crabtree says he found the backlash to the humanity star “instructive” and it demonstrated that New Zealanders would not tolerate what they deemed a “frivolous” use of space.How well they will tolerate US spy satellites is yet to be seen – the first launch is scheduled for next week.“I think it revealed New Zealanders have strong environmental values and they’re now playing out in a space context,” he says. “Globally people haven’t thought of space in those terms before.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150017.1579862765!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il promises 10m redress fund for celtic tiger building defects","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAndrew Prior and Kath Cottier from the Construction Defects Alliance outside Leinster House.

Only the most serious, emergency cases would have access to this fund, which would be separate to that available for pyrite and mica-affected homes.The party has also promised to revise the remit of Home Building Finance Ireland to make low-cost, long-term loans available to the owners management companies of apartment blocks.The party has also said it will put a ban on rogue builders who are found to be in breach of building regulations, though it is unclear how this would be implemented.Further down the line, the party said it intends to provide tax relief to the owners of defective homes for remediation work carried out.It is estimated that more than 90,000 apartments across the State are affected by defects such as water ingress, insecure balconies and a lack of fire-stopping material.An  investigation running since December 2018 has uncovered defects in 33 developments comprising over 2,100 apartments in Ireland. Owners have faced bills of up to €60,000 to remediate severe mould, collapsing roof canopies, rotting balconies and an extensive lack of fire safety measures.All major political parties have now committed to addressing the issue of Celtic Tiger building defects in their manifestos, the  understands.The Green Party has promised an independent building standards regulator, which would not be paid for by the developer as it is at the moment.It has also promised interest free loans and tax relief on the remediation works carried out.The party is also set to call for owners of defective homes to be exempt from property tax.At present, owners of properties with a significant level of pyrite can apply for a temporary exemption from the property tax.Sinn Féin housing spokesperson Eoin Ó’Broin said his party is calling for “a latent defects redress board to provide information to homeowners with mediation and adjudication to ensure where possible the developer pays for the remediation of any defects”.The party also calls for “a fund, paid for by the construction industry and government to ensure that where the developer is no longer pursuable funds will be available so owners do not have to foot the bill for defects they did not create”.The outgoing Fine Gael Government has declined to take any action to address the issue, repeatedly expressing concern about exposing taxpayers to an unquantifiable liability.However, it understood that the party now intends to include measures to help owners of defective homes in their Election 2020 manifesto. Details of what these measures would be were not available at the time of writing.The Labour Party has also committed to a package of measures to address boom-time building defects. These measures include low-cost loans and extra assistance where fire safety is found to be inadequate.The Social Democrats will also address the issue in their manifesto, with their commitments based on the recommendations of the 2018 Oireachtas committee’s Safe as Houses report.The Construction Defects Alliance met with Minister for State for Housing Damien English last Tuesday, as well as two senior officials from the Department of Housing, to discuss their concerns.Spokeswoman for the alliance Kath Cottier said they had “constructive engagement” with the Minister but given the fact the meeting took place in the context of a general election “any real action on this matter will take place during the lifetime of the next government”.“What’s contained in the manifestoes really represents ‘a toe in the door’ and that is why we will be continuing to engage locally and nationally with the parties and groupings to ensure that whatever the outcome of the election, the next Programme for Government will contain robust commitments to assist the owners of defective apartments.“Only then will we really have a proper foot in the door, after which we will then seek to get into the room to engage intensively with the next government,” Ms Cottier said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150126.1579872593!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mary lou mcdonald criticies miche%C3%A1l martin s cantankerous approach","story":"Speaking on the campaign trail in Tralee, Co Kerry on Friday, Ms McDonald claimed Mr Martin might soon be saying he will not go into government with his own party having already ruled out doing so with Sinn Féin and Fine Gael. “He won’t do government with Sinn Féin.

Britain’s departure from the EU next week.Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen put their signatures to the document in Brussels after the Queen gave royal assent to the legislation implementing the agreement on Thursday.The European Parliament is now expected to vote to approve the agreement on Wednesday, paving the way for the UK to leave on Friday next week, January 31st.It will mark the start of an 11-month transition period, during which the UK will continue to follow EU rules, before the final break with Brussels at the end of the year.British prime minister Boris Johnson has said that he wants to negotiate a comprehensive free trade deal with the EU by the end of the year.However, Ms von der Leyen and other senior EU figures have warned the British government’s stated intention to end the UK’s alignment with EU regulations means it will be impossible to achieve within such a tight timetable.Mr Johnson, however, remains upbeat, insisting Britain can now move forward after years of wrangling over Brexit.“At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we’ve done it,” he said.“Now we can put the rancour and ision of the past three years behind us and

Photograph: Peter SummersGetty ImagesJust days ahead of Britain’s exit from the European Union, both sides claim to be well prepared for the forthcoming negotiations about their future relationship. Downing Street says Boris Johnson would happily start the talks the day after Brexit Day, if only the EU didn’t have to wait until February 24th to agree its negotiating mandate.Whitehall sources recall that the EU complained that Theresa May’s government was never clear about what it wanted, adding that Johnson’s approach would present no such problems. Britain wants a Canada-style free trade deal, they say, citing the Conservative manifesto’s promise that the future arrangement should involve no “political alignment”.The EU is unsure, however, what London means when it says it wants no alignment, and some in Brussels wonder if Downing Street itself knows.We will get an idea of the EU’s approach to the negotiations in the days after Brexit Day, when the European Commission publishes its “negotiation directives”. These will be the commission’s proposals for the negotiating mandate that must be approved by the 27 member-state governments.If Downing Street thinks the commission’s proposals represent an outlandish opening bid that will be substantially watered down by the member states, it is likely to be disappointed. Michel Barnier, who is leading the EU’s negotiating team, has been consulting the 27 governments to ensure that the commission’s proposals contain no surprises and the directives he publishes are likely to be close to the final negotiating mandate.Johnson will outline Britain’s approach in a speech in early February, which could also sketch out what he hopes to achieve in a trade deal with the US.Scaling downDespite warnings from Brussels about the tight timetable for the negotiations, both sides agree that it is possible to agree a deal by the end of this year, although the EU insists that such an agreement will have to be very limited. This could involve a dramatic scaling down of ambition a few months into the negotiations, prioritising progress in those areas where a cliff-edge at the end of the Brexit transition period at the end of December would be most damaging.Britain and the EU have a mutual interest in securing a free trade agreement covering goods and a security arrangement that allows them to continue to share information on criminal suspects and to extradite them with ease.The EU believes it is making Britain a generous offer of zero-tariff, zero-quota access for goods to its market of 450 million people. What it demands in return is a commitment from Britain to maintain a “level playing field” on state aid, social and environmental standards and taxation.Speaking in Davos on Thursday, chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid said Britain was leaving the single market and the customs union to gain control of its rules and laws.“We will be a sovereign and independent country, not a rule-taker. But we’ll always protect the interests of British businesses throughout this process and we’ll maintain high standards – not because we are told to, but because we want to,” he said.Voluntary arrangementJavid’s remarks reflect a view in Downing Street that Britain can voluntarily maintain high standards but it cannot agree to anything that would mean automatically adopting new rules set in Brussels. This rules out “dynamic alignment” with EU rules but it does not necessarily exclude a commitment to “non-regression” by maintaining at least the same high standards when the transition period ends in December.In May’s deal, which the EU regards as the starting point for negotiations, Britain agreed to dynamic alignment on state aid rules but only to non-regression on social and environmental standards. On taxation, Britain agreed to remain aligned with a number of directives.In reality, Britain spends much less on state aid than other big European countries, so a major expansion in its support for businesses would probably be possible even if it agreed to non-regression with the EU. EU member states watched with alarm Johnson’s swift intervention to rescue the airline Flybe and they will want any free trade agreement to include a cast-iron commitment on limiting state aid.Despite Johnson’s wish to de-dramatise the negotiations, they will inevitably hit turbulence, particularly on issues such as fish, which raise passions in a number of countries, including Britain. Any deal which is agreed within the few months available this year is certain to be a narrow one with major costs to Britain’s economy and to some member states. But neither side has yet adopted a position that makes a deal by December impossible.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The public address system announced another flight delay or cancellation every other minute.I had heard rumours that the city was shortly to be locked down entirely and on a Whatsapp group for British expats, one panicked member had told me his flight out the next day had been cancelled. “The rumours are true, they’re locking us down!” he said. I was hit by a wave of relief as I finally sank into my seat on my plane to Shanghai. My face was sore and sweaty from the clammy face mask I\u0027d been wearing all day, but I’d made it out in time - just.When I had arrived a couple of days earlier Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, was eerily deserted. A few residents with basic face masks were casually finishing up their Spring Festival shopping as the country wound down for the Lunar New Year holiday this weekend. There had been dozens of confirmed cases by that point and a handful of deaths linked to the coronavirus.A token string of police tape flapped in the wind at the shuttered market where the virus was first discovered on December 31. A camouflage containment tent and a pile of used face masks on the floor beyond the barricade was the only hint that I was at ground zero of an international epidemic.According to residents the market sold live wolf pups, porcupines and other exotic animals. Fresh game killed \u0027warm\u0027 in front of shoppers has been partly blamed for creating prime breeding grounds for diseases like the coronavirus.Coronavirus everything you need to know puffA mile away I stumbled across another similar market, stacked high with colorful fruit and veg, and fat cuts of raw meat swinging on hooks in the stiff  breeze. “It’s quiet today because a lot of people have left for Chinese New Year,” Rong Bao, a 27-year-old stall holder told me. “The virus is serious but it’s under control.”At the airport the flight cancellations were stacking up and the rumours were mounting that a lockdown was imminent. But as I dashed for my plane I still breezed through security with no additional screening.Staff members disinfecting at the Yingtan North Railway Station in NanchangHours after I got out authorities ordered a total and unprecedented shutdown of Wuhan and two surrounding cities. All trains were cancelled, flights were grounded and roads were blocked in and out.As I sat on the Shanghai metro after arriving home, tussles were breaking out over the last bag of rice or the final bottle of milk in Wuhan’s supermarkets. The streets were once again abandoned.The wholesale market where the virus was discoveredBy mid-morning on Thursday, trucks were slowly roaming the streets spraying disinfectant into every crevice while lines of soldiers stood stoic, masked and silent outside the entrances of all major transport hubs with a looped recording on loud speakers warning residents to stay away.A rare silence blanketed my metro carriage as I looked up to see a sea of face masks and furrowed brows glued to phones. The death toll was climbing and new cases appearing around the country - and as far away as the US. Wuhan may have been quarantined but the deadly disease has not stopped at the city limits.Pandemics and epidemicsBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Withdrawal Agreement Bill signed by European Commission\u0026#39Boris could be PM for the next 15 years\u0026#39 -  readers on this week\u0026#39s top storiesChinese New Year 2020: Rats, luck and why you should avoid medicine, laundry and crying childrenSaudi Arabian satirist sues Kingdom in UK court over alleged phone hackingPrince Charles delivers a strong message of support for the plight of the Palestinian peopleScotland Yard to deploy facial recognition cameras to catch capital\u0026#39s most violent criminalsThe best of The  in audio: The battle of the billionaires and how AI could combat the coronavirus North Korea appoints ex-army officer as new foreign minister in signal of hardline stance with USComment: As Whitehall plots to crush Dominic Cummings, prepare for a dirty anti-Brexit warConvicted rapist who attacked police officer with two-foot machete jailed for 16 yearsNorthern Irish man wanted in connection with Essex lorry deaths to be extradited Australia Day 2020: why the British sent convicts Down Under - and how they named the countryGovernment calls Cobra meeting on coronavirus after health watchdog says it is \u0026#39highly likely\u0026#39 in UK Coronavirus: China hastily builds new 1000-bed hospital in Wuhan to tackle outbreakBrexit day: what happens after January 31?Brexit deal: what does it mean for you?Comment: Why I, a Brexit Party MEP, voted for Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit dealChina locks down 14 cities as Wuhan coronavirus spreadsThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayHow will the Brexit transition period work?How popular is Donald Trump?

And as I say that the majority of people. It does look as if they’re making a full recovery.”Sir Jeremy Farrar, of the Wellcome Trust, said: “I am alarmed, but there is a big difference between that and panic. If this does take off like in China the pressure on the NHS will be very difficult.”GPs have been told to isolate anyone with symptoms that could indicate coronavirus who have recently travelled from Wuhan in China.Guidance from Public Health England said doctors should check the travel history of patients.If they suspect a patient has coronavirus, they should be placed in a room away from other patients and staff with the door closed.They should not be allowed to use communal toilet facilities or be physically examined, the guidance adds.Coronaviruses | How to reduce your risk of infectionA letter from the chief medical officer to clinical staff warns that the mass movement of people within and outside China associated with the upcoming Chinese new year celebrations may amplify transmission.The letter said that anyone who is confirmed as having the virus will be transferred to a Airborne High Consequences Infectious Disease centre (HCID).According to Public Health England, there are four interim Airborne HCID centres in England.These are Guy\u0027s and St Thomas\u0027 NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust and Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.A vaccine could be a year away, leading scientists have said. Dr Richard Hatchett CEO of CEPI has said that even with “very aggressive, very rapid clinical trials” they are still looking at “a year at a minimum” before the vaccines could be ready.He told the Today Programme on Friday morning: “We have very ambitious timelines. Coronavirus everything you need to know puff“We are hoping that the vaccines that we announced the partnerships for yesterday could be potentially entering clinical trials sometime in the summer. Dr Paul Stoffels, M.D. Chief Scientific Officer at Johnson \u0026amp Johnson added that companies have started the “basic work” into a vaccine but it will take “several months” before it can go for clinical trials. “The lab technicians and scientists have told me today that they have already advanced the first version of a vaccine into the laboratories. “That will take several months before it will be able to be tested in the clinic.”  But Dr Hatchett said that the timeline for a vaccine for coronavirus represented “tremendous progress” since the Ebola vaccines, which he said had been under development for about a decade or more. Dr Stoffels agreed and said that Ebola was a “wake up call to the world” and that there are now systems in place “to work so much faster”. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), partially financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, announced yesterday that they will fund three programmes with the aim being to advance nCoV-2019 vaccine candidates into clinical testing as quickly as possible.CEPI aims to develop vaccines for new and emerging diseases before they become global health emergencies.It said it has moved with great urgency to promote the development of new vaccines against the emerging threat of nCoV-2019, adding that the novel coronavirus represents the first new epidemic disease of note to emerge since CEPI\u0027s founding at Davos in 2017.Meanwhile, Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome, said: This outbreak and the speed with which this new virus has spread in China and travelled across borders, is a reminder of how vulnerable we are globally to outbreaks of infectious diseases known and unknown.Travel restrictions may be important in buying time, to signal the seriousness of the situation and may help reduce the impact, but are unlikely stop this epidemic.Accelerating research as well as the public health response is key to bringing this under control. We still don\u0027t fully understand how this virus is passing person to person, how and when people are infectious, the full range of clinical symptoms, or know the animal source. We don\u0027t have proven treatments or vaccines.This virus has crossed from animals into people. That does not happen often, and it is without doubt, very serious.People are scarred by the memory of SARS, and a global outbreak of a novel respiratory virus like this, is something experts have warned about for many years.But we have also made important progress on epidemic preparedness. In the wake of the West African Ebola crisis, CEPI (the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) was founded.Today CEPI launched three programmes to speed vaccine research for this new coronavirus, and in China treatments are being tried and the information shared.How the coronavirus spreadsCEPI is a partnership between public, private, philanthropic and civil organisations, and its priority diseases include Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever and Chikungunya virus.The coalition has reached more than 750 million US dollars of its one billion dollar funding target, and to date it has committed to investing more than 456 million dollars in vaccine and platform development.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has updated its travel advice for China, with a spokesman saying: In light of the latest medical information, including reports of some person-to-person transmission, and the Chinese authorities\u0027 own advice, we are now advising against all but essential travel to Wuhan.The safety and security of British nationals is always our primary concern and we advise British nationals travelling to China to remain vigilant and check our travel advice on gov.uk.Professor Neil Ferguson, director of the Medical Research Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, said the estimated number of people infected with coronavirus in Wuhan is around 4,000, with a range between 1,000 and 9,700.Asked whether it is possible the virus has already reached the UK, Prof Ferguson said he could not rule it out. Other experts said it was likely that cases would be seen in Britain.Dr Andrew Freedman, Reader in Infectious Diseases at Cardiff University, said: It is likely that further cases will be seen in other countries around the world, including the UK and Europe, in the days \u0026amp weeks to come.

It’s not just because the contestants look the same each year, or because their conversations are dull as dishwater. It’s about what they wear.\u0026nbspEvery year, the same cohort of aspiring Instagram influencers bounds into that sun-soaked villa claiming to be “looking for love” when in fact, the only thing they’re looking for is a contract with Boohoo. Or Missguided. Or Nasty Gal. Or any other fast fashion brand that will pay them oodles of money to wear their clothes and sit in on a design meeting or two.\u0026nbspSince the ITV2 programme started in its current iteration, its contestants have gone on to land six-figure deals with fast fashion labels. Last season alone, female stars including Molly-Mae Hague, Maura Higgins and Amber Gill all landed up lucrative partnerships with Pretty Little Thing, Boohoo and MissPap, respectively – Gill’s is rumoured to be worth £1m. The men fared well\u0026nbsptoo\u0026nbsp– Ovie Soko got a deal with ASOS while Tommy Fury was snapped up by Boohoo Man. They follow in the footsteps of former contestants like Kem Cetinay, Amber Davies and Olivia Buckland, who have also gone on to partner with fast fashion brands since leaving the show.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCreated with Sketch.Winter Love Island 2020: Meet the 12 contestants Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Shaugna is a democratic services officer from London.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only the first one, just to clarify that.”The choice between the red or blue pill has become a popular meme in the years since the release of the 1999 hit. In the film, choosing the red pill means being aware of the cruel truths of everyday life, while taking the blue pill is opting to remain living in blissful ignorance.Created with Sketch.19 films to look out for in 2020 Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star.

Strong customer acquisition activity, supported by robust operational performance, has driven good momentum in all our markets.”Asos kept its outlook for the full year unchanged, and said it would focus on trying to retain the new customers who have started using its website.The UK, while still the most important single market for the company, lost some of its revenue share.UK retail sales hit almost £409m, 18 per cent\u0026nbspup on the year before, but international retail sales jumped by 22 per cent, including a 23 per cent increase in the US.If I’m giving up fast fashion for 2020, Love Island should tooIt means that the UK’s share of retail sales is 38 per cent, down from nearly 39 per cent a year earlier.“As we said in October, the focus for this year is to further enhance our capabilities and leverage the investments we have made,” Mr Beighton said.The company shipped 27.7 million orders in the four months, a 20 per cent rise on the same period in 2018.

After the initial 18-month period comes to an end – which for many people will be next month – those who have not brought down their balances could be put on to a payment plan or face more severe options.Akansha Nath, credit expert at Credit Karma, which commissioned the survey, said: “It’s daunting to think that we might be well into April before we’re consistently back in the black, but rather than using ‘quick fixes’ to free up some extra cash, there are lots of simple ways to get back in control of our finances, from creating a new budget to reviewing all outgoings or transferring debts to a 0 per cent balance transfer card.”Borrowers seeking a zero per cent credit card now have less choice available to them as banks have withdrawn some cards from the market and reduced the interest-free periods.This month, Bank of England research showed that the length of balance transfer deals reduced markedly and the availability of unsecured debt decreased towards the end of 2019 as lenders became more nervous about the UK economy.Financial website Moneyfacts says the number of cards that allow balance transfers has dropped by more than a third in the past three years to reach a record low.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also hinted that it may relax\u0026nbspits focus on tackling high inflation as it deals with a combination of slowing productivity and an ageing population, as well as the legacy of the financial crisis.“As our economies are undergoing profound changes, it is the time for a strategy review to ensure we deliver on our mandate in the best interest of Europeans,\u0026nbspECB president Christine Lagarde said on Thursday.Interest rates in the eurozone have been close to zero for the past four years as inflation has stayed below the ECB’s 2 per cent target for almost all of the last nine years. Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was the first time it had registered above the 50.0 points that marks the line between expansion and contraction the first time since August 2019.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It seems likely that the rise kills off the prospect of an imminent rate cut by the Bank of England, with policymakers taking a wait-and-see approach as they assess the performance of the economy in the post-Brexit environment,” IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said.The survey, which is based on reports from managers in offices and factories, was the highest for 16 months and signalled a moderate expansion of business activity across the UK private sector economy.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg bank, said that the jump in the PMIs for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the big election victory.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in Spring and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become Prime Minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders have pared back their bets for a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the OMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist, at HSBC said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.But he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

The share of companies warning in 2019 hit 17.8 per cent, just surpassing 2008’s figure at the peak of the financial crisis. A third of FTSE-listed retailers issued warnings in 2019.The figures came as the retail industry said shops shed 57,000 jobs in 2019 as employment in the once-vibrant high street and shopping centre contracted for the fourth successive year.The British Retail Consortium said the total number of retail employees fell by 1.8 per cent in the final three months of 2019 compared with a year earlier. Full time employment fell by 3.0 per cent and part-time by 1.2 per cent.This was the 16th consecutive quarterly fall, which the BRC said was “proof” that the transformation of the retail industry was ongoing.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive said it was essential the government used its review of the business rates system for a reform of a tax that fall disproportionately heavily on retailers.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After the initial 18-month period comes to an end – which for many people will be next month – those who have not brought down their balances could be put on to a payment plan or face more severe options.Akansha Nath, credit expert at Credit Karma, which commissioned the survey, said: “It’s daunting to think that we might be well into April before we’re consistently back in the black, but rather than using ‘quick fixes’ to free up some extra cash, there are lots of simple ways to get back in control of our finances, from creating a new budget to reviewing all outgoings or transferring debts to a 0 per cent balance transfer card.”Borrowers seeking a zero per cent credit card now have less choice available to them as banks have withdrawn some cards from the market and reduced the interest-free periods.This month, Bank of England research showed that the length of balance transfer deals reduced markedly and the availability of unsecured debt decreased towards the end of 2019 as lenders became more nervous about the UK economy.Financial website Moneyfacts says the number of cards that allow balance transfers has dropped by more than a third in the past three years to reach a record low.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also hinted that it may relax\u0026nbspits focus on tackling high inflation as it deals with a combination of slowing productivity and an ageing population, as well as the legacy of the financial crisis.“As our economies are undergoing profound changes, it is the time for a strategy review to ensure we deliver on our mandate in the best interest of Europeans,\u0026nbspECB president Christine Lagarde said on Thursday.Interest rates in the eurozone have been close to zero for the past four years as inflation has stayed below the ECB’s 2 per cent target for almost all of the last nine years. Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The voluntary agreements between different industry players have not yielded the desired results.Apple set to release cheaper and smaller iPhone, report saysBut Apple rejected that characterisation, suggesting that phone manufacturers had actually unified around two different ports. All iPhones have used its Lightning cable for nearly a decade, and most new Android phones use USB-C, it pointed out, claiming that this approach does work.Apple is unlikely to license its proprietary Lightning port to other phone manufacturers, meaning that any new EU rule would almost certainly mean the company would be forced to switch to a new port. That would mean Apple customers throwing away their wires and other accessories, the company claimed, which would have a direct negative impact by disrupting the hundreds of millions of active devices and accessories used by our European customers and even more Apple customers worldwide, creating an unprecedented volume of electronic waste and greatly inconveniencing users.Instead, Apple suggested that regulators should\u0026nbspfocus on the other end of the wire, where the charging cable plugs into the power. Unifying those ports would allow users to plug their charging cables into similar ports\u0026nbsp– in hotel rooms or\u0026nbspcafés, for instance – no matter what plug was on their phone.We do not believe there is a case for regulation given the industry is already moving to the use of\u0026nbspUSB\u0026nbspType-C through a connector or cable assembly, Apple said in its statement. This includes Apple’s\u0026nbspUSB-C\u0026nbsppower adapter which is compatible with all iPhone and\u0026nbspiPad\u0026nbspdevices. This approach is more affordable and convenient for consumers, enables charging for a wide range of portable electronic products, encourages people to re-use their charger and allows for innovation.The Lightning port was introduced in 2012, with the iPhone 5, as a replacement for Apple\u0027s old 30-pin connector. Since then it has been used on almost every one of Apple\u0027s portable devices, though the recent iPad Pro uses the industry standard USB-C port.Apple gave no firm indication that it would stick with the existing Lightning port in its iPhones. It has been rumoured that the company is moving towards getting rid of the charging port entirely, and recent handsets have included wireless charging that does away with the need for a wire.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder.

The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)However, anxious fans have been expressing their fear that they would miss out on tickets, given the huge demand.\u0026nbspMany joked about being logged onto multiple computers, while others predicted touts would sweep the majority before placing them on resale sites.Others complained about the price of a ticket, with standing being sold for around £80.\u0026nbspHowever, plenty of other fans rejoiced as they managed to get their tickets:The full My Chemical Romance tour schedule (so far) is as follows:25 March 2020 – The Outer Fields at Western Springs – Auckland, New ZealandThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Five frozen raw cookies were already up there.Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano was the master baker in December, radioing down a description as he baked them one by one in the prototype Zero G Oven.SpaceX to send Nasa astronauts to space soon, Elon Musk saysThe first cookie — in the oven for 25 minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius) — ended up seriously under-baked. He more than doubled the baking time for the next two, and the results were still so-so.The fourth cookie stayed in the oven for two hours, and finally success.So this time, I do see some browning, Parmitano radioed. I can\u0027t tell you whether it\u0027s cooked all the way or not, but it certainly doesn\u0027t look like cookie dough any more.Parmitano cranked the oven up to its maximum 325 degrees F (163 degrees C) for the fifth cookie and baked it for 130 minutes. He reported more success.Additional testing is required to determine whether the three returned cookies are safe to eat.As for aroma, the astronauts could smell the cookies when they removed them from the oven, except for the first.That\u0027s the beauty of baking in space, according to former NASA astronaut Mike Massimino. He now teaches at Columbia University and is a paid spokesman for DoubleTree by Hilton. The hotel chain provided the cookie dough, the same kind used for cookies offered to hotel guests. It\u0027s offering one of the space-baked cookies to the Smithsonian Institution\u0027s National Air and Space Museum for display.The reminder of home, the connection with home, I think, can\u0027t be overstated, Massimino said. From my personal experience ... food is pretty important for not just nutrition but also for morale in keeping people connected to their home and their Earth.Eating something other than dehydrated or prepackaged food will be particularly important as astronauts head back to the moon and on to Mars.Nanoracks and Zero G Kitchen, a New York City startup that collaborated with the experiment, are considering more experiments for the orbiting oven and possibly more space appliances. What\u0027s in orbit now are essentially food warmers.There\u0027s an added bonus of having freshly baked cookies in space.We made space cookies and milk for Santa this year, NASA astronaut Christina Koch tweeted.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But with utilities like water and energy, she said she would give companies a chance to show they can deal with problems like excessive profits if they wanted to avoid being taken back into public ownership.She said she would not scrap the HS2 high-speed rail link between London and the Midlands or the renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent.But she refused to say whether she would press the nuclear button if the country came under attack, insisting that she would follow former prime ministers including Margaret Thatcher in keeping the UK’s enemies guessing about Britain’s strategy.After playing video footage of her smiling as Ms Butler said that “if anyone doesn’t hate Brexit, even if you voted for it, there’s something wrong with you”, Neil told Ms Thornberry that her expression showed she was sneering.She responded indignantly: “I was not sneering… I really object to this.“When they say that I sneer at people, they forget who I am and where I come from.”Ms Thornberry, who was brought up in a council house in Guildford by her mother after her parents’ orce and went on to become a barrister, has previously been forced to defend herself against allegations of sneering over a tweet apparently mocking a white van driver whose home was decked with England flags.She told Neil: “It is the prime minister who has said that blue-collar workers like my brother, who is a builder, are largely unemployed, have low self-esteem and are drunk.“He is talking about my brother. No-one says that Boris Johnson sneers at people.“Somebody like me who comes from a council estate and from a single parent background, I don’t sneer at people, I listen to them.”Ms Thornberry said she had been “laughing at Dawn saying the most extraordinary things”, adding: “I have never sneered and it’s not right to say so, and I do not accept that.”Challenged over her decision to send her son to a partially selective comprehensive school 14 miles away from their north London home, Ms Thornberry replied: “As a politician, what I want to do is make sure we have good schools up and down the country.“But as a mother, I will never apologise for doing the best for my kids. Any mother watching this will agree with me.“As the victim of selective education who failed her 11-plus and went to a secondary modern, I feel very strongly about this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The report suggested reducing the size of the Lords by a quarter to no more than 600 peers and limiting the terms of new appointees to the chamber to 15 years.Lord Fowler added in his article that “in his experience” most peers take their role seriously, but added: “However, in the 2017-19 session, there were over 100 members who took part in fewer than 10 per cent of isions.”He continued: “My chief hope had been that the prime minister would follow the course of his predecessor, Mrs May, who pledged herself to ‘moderation’ in new appointments and that he would adopt the formula set out by the committee I established under the expert chairmanship of Terry Burns.“If the leaks are to be believed, then Labour have nominated eight new peers.\u0026nbsp“But they are just the Labour-nominated peers and the government will also have their own nominations which could well be double that of Labour.

It was the first time it had registered above the 50.0 points that marks the line between expansion and contraction the first time since August 2019.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It seems likely that the rise kills off the prospect of an imminent rate cut by the Bank of England, with policymakers taking a wait-and-see approach as they assess the performance of the economy in the post-Brexit environment,” IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said.The survey, which is based on reports from managers in offices and factories, was the highest for 16 months and signalled a moderate expansion of business activity across the UK private sector economy.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg bank, said that the jump in the PMIs for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the big election victory.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in Spring and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become Prime Minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders have pared back their bets for a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the OMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist, at HSBC said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.But he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

The petition, addressed to Mr Trudeau, reads: “Canadians wish the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, all the best as they seek financial independence. That goal is important because Canadian taxpayers shouldn’t have to cover the couple’s bills.”The Canadian island rallying to protect Meghan and Harry’s privacyAaron Wudrick, federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, a campaign group “dedicated to lower taxes, less waste and accountable government” told The Independent there was no personal animosity aimed at the royal couple, who are living in the town of North Saanich, 20 miles north of Victoria, the largest town on Vancouver Island.“In the last two weeks I received lots of phone calls from people saying the couple were welcome here, but that they did not want to pay for them,” said Mr Wudrick.\u0026nbsp“I think in recent weeks, that feeling has become more clear. Canada is a welcoming country, but some people excited they are here are viewing them as wealthy celebrities, rather than official members of the royal family where there is a protocol.”Meghan Markle’s father accuses daughter of quitting royal family for moneyHe added: “They are coming here because they want to leave the royal family, but part of that is paying their own bills.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While having offered them a warm welcome, and even helping them avoid media scrutiny, there is a view Canadians should not pay.“I think the point is, they are either private citizens or members of the royal family,” said Bruce Welsh, 70, a former musician and radio show host in Sidney. “If they are private citizens, they should not need security guards.

A petition will not make any difference,” she said.Michael Phillips, 73, who moved to Canada from Britain three decades ago, described himself as an arch anti-royalist.

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University. She had flitted easily between both sides, up until recently, when she moved to Shanghai. “I think the situation in Hong Kong is quite sensitive now, which is easy for people to have conflicts due to different political stands,” she says. “That’s why I’ve decided to leave Hong Kong to work and get away from the intense environment.”Even though the protests in Hong Kong show no sign of abating, Ke remains optimistic unity will overcome ision. She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Britain\u0027s Prime Minister, Theresa May, meets Russia\u0027s President, Vladimir Putin, during a bilateral meeting on the first day of the G20 summit on June 28, 2019 in Osaka, Japan. U.S. President Donald Trump arrived in Osaka on Thursday for the annual Group of 20 gathering together with other world leaders who will use the two-day summit to discuss pressing economic, climate change, as well as geopolitical issues. The US-China trade war is expected to dominate the meetings in Osaka as President Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet on Saturday in an attempt to resolve the ongoing the trade clashes between the world\u0027s two largest economies. The eventual wording\u0026nbspof the amendments also brought surprises. In particular, they offered no obvious constitutional short circuit\u0026nbspfor Mr Putin to exercise\u0026nbspformal power outside the presidency. Far from weakening the powers of a successor in favour of parliament or some new body, the changes actually strengthen the role. Any future president will be able to fire constitutional judges, and will also get an extra veto to block parliamentary votes.\u0026nbspSo what exactly are Mr Putin’s intentions? And if we assume that he is leaving the presidency, where does he want to end up?\u0026nbspThe honest answer is nobody knows. The Russian president has kept his cards close to his chest, and is unlikely to reveal them for some time.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFor the time being, his most likely post-2024 destination seems to be\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsprole\u0026nbspas head of a beefed-up State Council, a federal body comprised of regional governors\u0026nbspwhich up to now wielded only limited power. At his state of the nation address, Mr Putin suggested strengthening the council further. Many experts surmised that meant it could grow into a\u0026nbspcommittee\u0026nbsplike\u0026nbspthe Soviet Politburo, with a broad purview covering most policy areas.\u0026nbspRussia looks to prospect of future without Vladimir PutinThe constitutional amendment passed on Thursday fell roughly in line with such expectations. The State Council’s role was determined as follows: “Ensuring proper functioning and interaction between state bodies, and determining the main directions of domestic, foreign and socio-economic policy.” The exact scope of its powers will become clear in a separate law yet to be published.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Putin\u0026nbsphas also appeared to rule out the very\u0026nbspidea of him carving out a supervisory role above any successor.\u0026nbspSpeaking on Wednesday, Mr Putin said he did not intend to stay on and “mentor” in the way Singapore’s long-time leader Lee Kuan Yew did in the 1990s.\u0026nbsp“In different countries there are different situations, different histories, different cultures,” he said. “In Russia, if you put an institution above the president, it would mean dual power – a fatal situation for a country like ours.”\u0026nbspAll of which brings us to a more logical inference of Mr Putin’s constitutional rewrite: that he may, in fact, be paving the way for a genuine successor in 2024.\u0026nbspViewed from this perspective, the complicated constitutional\u0026nbsptrickery\u0026nbspmakes much more sense. The changes look to be geared less towards ensuring the continuation of Mr Putin as they are of guaranteeing the survival of Putinism and its\u0026nbspideologies.\u0026nbsp“The changes do not limit presidential prerogative in any real way and do not offer an obvious way for Putin to stay on,” says Tatyana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Centre. “What they do is strengthen the authority of the centre, as well as creating a transitory period in which Putin can observe a chosen successor from afar.”Wherever he ends up in 2024, Mr Putin will retain hold of three important levers of informal power, the expert says. He will remain the most popular politician in the land. He will be able to exercise power via United Russia, the ruling party he set up (and is likely to head). And he can act via the hundreds of people he appointed to high office.In today’s\u0026nbspRussia, such levers\u0026nbspcount\u0026nbspfor an awful lot.\u0026nbsp“It\u0026nbspshould be enough for him to remove a successor and try another one if he thinks it is necessary,” Ms Stanovaya says.\u0026nbspSocial media has been awash with possible theories as to why the president is acting in such a rush. Is he ill? Is he spooked by falling popularity? Is he acting on the advice of a psychic who advised him it was now or never? Or, more bizarrely: is there a lady, a Meghan Markle type, dragging him from the limelight?\u0026nbspHow 20 years of Putin has shaped Russia and the worldPolitical analyst Konstantin Kalachyov suggests\u0026nbspMr Putin’s haste is most likely provoked by a “combination” of factors.\u0026nbsp“We obviously cannot discount the idea that Mr Putin has a diagnosis of some kind, one that may not have a clear expiry date,” the analyst says. “At the same time, he’s already made it clear that he does not want to go down in history as a bumbling old Brezhnev-type figure. He understands it’s better to arrange these things while there is time and opportunity to do so.”\u0026nbspThe Russian president seems to be using the moment to ensure that a successor doesn’t change course.\u0026nbsp“All the amendments are about extending the life of Putinism. The central idea of national independence. The exclusion of external influence. The continuation of statism and a\u0026nbspconservative ideology,” Kalachyov says. \u0026nbsp“The one thing Putin doesn’t want is a repeat of what he did to Yeltsin – which was to rip up an entire legacy.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

On the contrary, it is an abdication that has sadly plunged him into turmoil.He is a man pulled in opposite directions, torn between patriotic duty and his deep love for his we, between his loyalty to the monarchy and his desire for a new, less constrained role.That explains why, throughout the recent crisis that he and Meghan inflicted on the House of Windsor, his stance has been so confused and contradictory.He speaks of his devotion to Britain but seeks a fresh start in Canada.He expresses his desire to serve but gives up the commitments that go with his position.He trumpets his yearning for privacy, yet he and his we appear keen to set themselves up as a millionaire celebrity couple - hardly the way to avoid attention.He continually wails about media intrusion, yet he resigns as Captain-General of the Royal Marines so he can spend more time on his social media accounts.He and the Duchess endlessly talk about their need for emotional support, yet they have shown little concern for the needs of their own families.Those inconsistencies were graphically exposed in the speech he made on Sunday night at a charity dinner in London to try and justy his recent conduct.His address was given in the immediate aftermath of the deal reached at Sandringham, where he and Meghan agreed to the loss of public funding and the use of their titles infor their independence.It was clear that the saga had exacted a heavy toll on him. In a voice often cracking with emotion, he told his audience that they would “hear the truth from me”.But what they actually heard was a catalogue of embittered anguish.As often, he moaned about the press, which he painted as a sinister, powerful force which needs to be curtailed.Unfortunately, despite all his professed love of Britain, Harry appears to have no understanding that a free, open media is essential to our democracy.He has proved unable to handle any criticism at all – even when it is justied, as in the hypocrisy of his green campaigning while indulging in the use of private jets.It is ashe thinks the media should be filled with fawning sycophants who never scrutinise but just lavish him with praise.That is the kind of regime that belongs to a totalitarian dictatorship, not traditionally liberal Britain.Much of Harry’s hostility to journalists stems from their relationship with his mother. But, however understandable, this is another myth.Princess Diana was not naïve when it came to the press. She was a shrewd, sometimes ruthless operator, who was quite willing to exploit the newspapers when it suited her.With some indignation, he complained that the Sandringham deal was not what he wanted. But it was foolish of him to believe that he and Meghan could have semi-detached Royal status, enjoying its privileges without its obligations.The Queen could never have tolerated that, especially because any commercial deals reached by the Sussexes could have badly compromised her family, just as their cherished fashionable causes could have undermined the Crown.Royalty cannot be a vehicle for self-enrichment or political posturing.The Duke’s inner agony was at its most obvious when he spoke of his regrets for the le he is leaving.Having revealed that he and Meghan were excited to “fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride”, he referred to his “great sadness” at the step they have taken.Yet he claimed that they had “really no other option”. It was another moment of self-deceit, for there were certainly other courses open to them.They could have either stuck to their Royal positions without creating such a psycho drama about themselves, or,they really wanted freedom without scrutiny, they could have retired to live quietly as ordinary citizens, as some other members of the Royal family have done in the past.But such modesty would not have fulfilled their ambitions to be globe-trotting celebrities.It is this craving for fame that highlights the emptiness of Harry’s language about his devotion to service. “I will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his le to supporting the causes, charities and military communities so important to me,” he declared at the charity dinner.Yet this is the same man who was revealed to have touted his we’s voiceover skills to Disney bosses at the London premiere of the Lion King last summer.In the eyes of their critics, the real dedication that Harry and Meghan will probably soon show is to TV deals, book advances, and brand partnerships.In a further attempt to justy their actions, Harry implied that they had been suffering for a long time through the crushing restrictions of Royal le.The final move had been made, he explained, “after so many months of talks and so many years of challenges.”He and Meghan have only been married for  months. A true model of stoical determination, the Queen has been on the throne for almost  years without any public complaint.That just illustrates Harry’s lack of perspective. Insulated by privilege, he has little understanding of the lives of ordinary British citizens, many of whom have endured far greater struggles than anything he has ever experienced.After the Queen had been so publicly generous about him and Meghan in her statement from Sandringham at the weekend, saying that “they will always be much loved members of my family,” it was bad manners of Harry to complain about the deal he had just accepted.He should have responded to his grandmother’s generosity in the same spirit.But what’s done is done. Our monarchy has survived its latest crisis. The moment for recriminations has passed now that a new chapter is about to begin.As he settles in Canada, Prince Harry is bound to miss aspects of his old le in Britain, which even now he describes as “my home and the place I love.And the British public will miss him. At his best, he brought a lovable humour, spontaneity and lack of convention to the Royal Family.We can only hope that now, after taking this drastic decision, he finds the peace that he and Meghan crave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which makes Hall’s defence of the licence fee even more ridiculous.In an era of multiple-choice subscription TV it is absurd for one broadcaster to be funded by a tax enforceable by criminal penalty.It is even more laughable to claim it “ensures independence­ . . . obliges us to serve everyone and reflect every part of the UK”.Hall’s BBC spent his entire tenure turning a deaf ear to half the UK. Hence its shock at last month’s Tory triumph.Hall’s decision to rob over-s of the free licences he agreed to in  was equally outrageous.The idea that the £million cost will harm vital BBC services, when so much of its content amounts to needless competition with commercial rivals, is fatally flawed.His successor must run a smaller Beeb, more in touch with the public, less in the grip of suffocating “wokeness”, focused not on gratuitous expansion but the high-quality shows it does best.This new chief should accept that non-payment of the licence must be decriminalised and the levy finally replaced with a voluntary subscription.Only then will the BBC join the st Century.THE problem with Harry saying he and Meghan had no option but to move abroad to avoid our “powerful media” is that not a word of it is true.It is sheer paranoia to say the Press has done anything but legitimately scrutinise a publicly-funded couple.And the reality is they do not want to avoid media. They want to avoid criticism.Indeed they crave media attentionit meekly writes their PR puff pieces. Corbyn’s Labour is the same.As for having no choice, what drivel.They could have grown up, developed a thicker skin and done their royal duty as they first promised.To pretend that dark forces made them seek a vast fortune as A-list celebs in the LA sunshine is self-serving cobblers.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Prince Charles will see to that.Harry will continue to receive £million from his father, but although Charles has amassed a personal fortune of over £million, the money might not be coming from that closely guarded pot.The prince could instead be paying him through a outdated racket called the Duchy of Cornwall.Charles could claim this as a business expense which means he can reduce the amount of tax he pays. The public would be paying for Harry by the back door.Harry of course has no connection with this sprawling property company called the Duchy, but that has never stopped Charles benefiting from its special tax status.The status of the Duchy has been contested for decades and while Charles insists it is private, thats strongly disputed by others.Charles has also claimed as business expenses the cost of  personal staff to pamper him – butlers, valets, gardeners.He had the cheek to argue that Camilla’s personal costs even before they married were a Duchy expense so claimed for her staff, her travel, her jewellery, and the stabling of her horses.And he got away with it. The line was only drawn when he tried to claim his polo ponies as business expenses.In my time in Parliament I saw plenty of MPs claiming for duck houses, moat cleaning and the like. Is this dferent So what is this Duchy  Well it’s not just in Cornwall where it has land. Its tentacles stretch far and wide. It even owns the Oval cricket ground. Extra cover for the Prince as he hits the taxpayer for six.The Duchy turns in a profit of over £million a year. That is money that many argue should go straight to the Treasury. Instead it becomes pocket money for the Prince.He has reluctantly agreed he should pay tax on this money but the vast array of creative expenses he conjures up means in a recent year when the Duchy made £.million, only £.million was paid in tax at  per cent.That can only be explainedhe dreamed up more than £million in expenses.Charles says the Duchy is a “private estate” — which it is legally, but it acts like a public body that reverts to the Crown when theres no Duke of Cornwall.It has had notices served on it by the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency and they can only be served on a public body.It is the harbour authority for the Isles of Scilly. The Information Commissioner has ruled it is public.But by insisting it is private means the Duchy’s accounting practices can be hidden away. No right of access for the National Audit Office. No freedom of information.If you go cap in hand and bow and scrape, they might let you see some old Duchy paperwork. On the other hand, they might not.In this medieval throwback, Charles scoops up the property of anybody who dies without leaving a will. The general right for a King or Queen to do this was abolished in . But not in the Duchy.Yet this so-called private estate suddenly becomes public when it suits Charles. Unlike any other private estate in Britain, it doesn’t pay any corporation tax or capital gains tax.No wonder Charles is worth over £million.Suddenly the private Prince becomes a public figure, demanding – and getting – the right to change government legislation that affects the Duchy in a way he doesn’t like.To be fair, he does pay the market rent for the vast property he occupies at Highgrove. He pays it to the Duchy which then s the money to him, tax-free, as the Duke of Cornwall in a sort of merry money-go-round.He got Duchy employees to grow trees on Duchy land and then sold the timber to... The Duchy. Charles pocketed £.million tax free for this racket.The Duchy of Cornwall is not some hobby growing a bit of organic lettuce here and there. Nor is it a small collection of twee cottages as you might infer from the pictures the Duchy uses in its publications.No, it is a hard-headed ruthless property company with advantages in tax and law that no other company has.It is a massive money-making machine for Prince Charles, money that rightly belongs to us all but that he erts to himself.It’s time for this medieval monstrosity to be sorted out.

You have to be creative and aggressive and think two steps ahead of the celebrity.”And therein lies the rub. Largely stripped of his royal status, Harry is now a common-or-garden celebrity who has to take his chances with the rest of them in the jungle of hustling for work amid bustling premiere crowds.Then there’s news website TMZ and its myriad wannabe imitations. They’ll be dogging his every move with a video camera, hoping to catch a magical clickbait moment.Its website — together with a frenzied voiceover — is already jokingthat Meghan might sign up for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.As a former actress on cable show Suits,Meghan was of little interest to the Hollywood glitterati and the parasites that feed off them.But now  She’s gold-dust — particularly as her inner circle includes A-listers such as the Clooneys, Serena Williams, Oprah and the Obamas. And therein lies yet another rub. If you attend premieres of movies you’re not in, holiday on rich people’s jets and yachts and hang out at members-only clubs where the hoi polloi are only allowed in to clean up after you . . . then you are wilfully choosing a “celebrity le” and, with that, comes media attention, particularly from the Wild West of online.They need you for clickbait, and you need them to maintain the “popularity” upon which you trade and, without which, you are nothing .Unless, of course, you have a God- given talent like Meryl Streep, Judi Dench, Gary Oldman, Benedict Cumberbatch etc, etc — all of whom put on a suit frock when they have a film to promote but otherwise live a perfectly normal, unremarkable and, therefore, largely “peaceful le” unbothered by the media.Or a member of the British Royal Family who can retreat to one of their many estates for a spot of fishing and contemplation.So . . . “a more peaceful le” outside the protective environs of the monarchy  Dream on.But then, deep down, one suspects that Harry and Meghan both know that and are simply using it as a smokescreen for the real story.His we was homesick, found royal duties restrictive and dull and wanted toto her old le with royal knobs on.And because Harry loves her: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”Good luck to them. Genuinely. But let’s not pretend they had no other option because of something this country did or didn’t do.HARRY and Meghan might be forced to ditch their proposed Sussex Royal brandThe Queen sees it as cashing in on their former royal status.As they’ve already registered it for everything from magazines to mugs, dropping it altogether could prove expensive.So perhaps a little tweak — to  Sussex Royle — might be an easy and appropriate compromise As the incomparable Jim Royle, aka Ricky Tomlinson, might say: “Have their cake and eat it  . . My a***.”SHORTLY after actor Laurence Fox’s sterling, anti-PC performance on Question Time last week, he was predictably hosed down on Twitter by the usual virtue-signalling suspects.Including this from singer Lily Allen.“Sick to death of luvvies like aLawrence Fox going on TV and forcing their opinions on everybody , when he’ll never have to deal with what normal people have to deal with in his gated community.“Stick to acting mate. Instead of ranting about things you don’t know anything about.”Lily, for those in blissful ignorance, is a former public school girl fond of forcing her opinions on everyone  from the comfort of, among other locations, her former mansion in the Cotswolds which, according to Vogue, was: “Hidden away down a deliciously long drive.”That, folks, is what they call irony.Or should we now call it Alleny ROSIE Huntigton-Whiteley says she looks this way because most days she doesn’t eat past pm.She adds that, since having her two-year-old son Jack: “Things don’t sit where they used to, but I’ve come to terms with it.”Yep, I think I could also come to terms with things not sitting where they used tothey sat whereRosie’s things do.EVERY so often, amid all the headlines of gloom and despair, we are bathed in the warm glow that comes from a small slice of humanity.Remember when little Oscar Saxelby-Lee needed a le-saving stem cell donation and thousands  of people from his home city of Worcester queued up to seethey matched Ultimately, a crowd-funding campaign raised £k to send him to Singapore for pioneering treatment and, this week, it was announced that he’s free from cancer.Or what about the two Tesco workers in Southend, Essex, who, upon noticing that a regular customer hadn’t been in, looked through her letterbox and found her lying unresponsive in the hallway.Thanks to them giving a damn, she is now recovering in hospital.Local heroes, every last one of them.THE Duke and Duchess of Cambridge hosted African leaders and our own PM at Buckingham Palace.

He will be sentenced on February .As Mihai was convicted of fraud, Ms Oruwari said: It has reiterated the fact I am vulnerable and more susceptible to crime and being taken advantage of.The Nigeria-born singer was a finalist on BBC talent show All Together Now, where she brought Geri Halliwell to tears.She has toured the world as a solo soprano and performed at the Royal Opera House.Ms Oruwari, who lost her sight as a child, said: To lead a full le I have to trust people.

Which they are on ­commercial rivals like Nick Ferrari on LBC or Julia Hartley-Brewer on TalkRADIO.At least those stations don’t start from a position of: “Brexit is evil and a majority Tory government isn’t much ­better.”No one is proposing for a single second the BBC be axed. But the poll tax that funds it should be.Its websites that write clickbait about TV shows like Love Island — well ­covered by other online outlets — should be stopped too. Not to mention its recent push into the already saturated podcast market.The BBC’s job is not to be a monolith, shutting out commercial organisations and dominating the entertainment and news industries.That’s what makes yesterday’s decision to axe Victoria Derbyshire’s BBC programme ridiculous.Her award-winning morning show is one of the only news programmes on the ­corporation to properly cover the working class.It is unbiased, feisty, fair and will cover entertainment stories or whatever happens to be the splash of The Sun that day, without the snobbery of the rest of BBC News.That sort of non-commercial show is just the type the Beeb should be making. But — of course — under its latest cuts, it is the first to go.The next Director-General must be an outsider who understands the madness of the BBC’s current priorities and is ­prepared to enact real change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And climate change, whether the prince wants to acknowledge it or not, is an innately political issue.Two of the world’s biggest players – the US and China – are nowhere close to where we are on the so-called crisis.It’s up to Boris Johnson to criticise them and for Charles to calm them down with ceremonial State visits.Sure, Charles should be offering his support and sympathy to the people of Australia impacted by bushfires, for example.Perhaps he could even visit the area and talk about the damage.But offering a ten-point solution politicians should enact is insane – especially given he flew to Davos on a £, private jet trip that emitted six tonnes of carbon.If the hypocritical prince is so impetuous that he can’t see the time has come for his role to change, I genuinely fear for the Royal Family.The last thing the country needs is another two-bit political wannabe trying to gain popularity on the back of Greta.What we desperately need is a future king who can bring us together beyond politics and beyond the embarrassing PR mess engulfing his family.CHRIS MARTIN swore at fans this week who were trying to get his autograph following a Coldplay gig in LA.Shocking, isn’t it  Who asks for an autograph these days How vintage. ORLANDO BLOOM will voice Prince Harry in a comedy cartoon called The Prince for US broadcaster HBO, which is set to poke fun at our calamitous royals.I hope the actor has put in the hours perfecting how to whinge relentlessly. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That windfall came to be dependent on Anthony Sootherans death. And she got impatient, and worried that the windfall might elude her.”He added: “With a view to securing his inheritance and with Wayne Rickard’s assistance, Lynda Rickard precipitated Anthony Sootheran’s death.“In short, for their own gain, they killed him by isolating him, neglecting him, failing to obtain appropriate medical help for him and depriving him of food and drink.“In short, they starved him to death.”Mr Saxby said the Sootherans, who had signicant land ownership in Yorkshire and “substantial savings and investments moved in with the Rickards, in , to be cared for.Mary Sootheran died aged  in August , and the couple continued to care for Mr Sootheran.But when a doctor called at the farm they shared in South Newington, Oxfordshire, on March  , she discovered Mr Sootheran dead in his bed with sores.The jury heard Mrs Rickard admitted to using between £, to £, worth of Mrs Sootherans money as her own and £, to £, of Mr Sootherans “over a period of time”.The jury were told she had previously pleaded guilty to four fraud charges, two counts of forgery, two counts of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and possession of articles for use in fraud.Mrs Rickard is further charged with the manslaughter of Mr Sootheran through gross negligence and also abusing her position as carer by using his money for her own purposes.Mr Rickard, , is accused of causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable adult.The couple are both accused of a single count of fraud by  representation relating to Mrs Sootheran.Michael Dunkley, , of Bloxham, Oxfordshire, and Denise Neal, , of Lower Tysoe, Warwickshire, are charged with one count of fraud by  representation after allegedly claiming Mr Sootheran’s will was genuine.Shanda Robinson, , of Banbury, Oxfordshire, is charged with one count of fraud by  representation claiming Mary Joy Sootheran’s will was genuine and witnessed in her presence.Mrs Robinson is also accused of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.All five defendants deny all the outstanding charges against them. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

was waiting in line for paperwork when he lost consciousness and collapsed.Another horrying picture shows a man reportedly dead on the ground with blood pouring from his head.One local news site in Wuhan reports that the victim in the picture died from coronavrius.Posting the image on social media, their caption read: It is stated that a person infected with coronavirus died in blood.Some of the other images being shared widely on social media are believed to be from Wuhan although at this stage remain unveried.Residents in the ground-zero city, where the virus originated, have been told to avoid crowds and not to attend public gatherings leaving the streets looking like a ghost town - despite its  million population.Other images online show a sea of people wearing masks crowding a corridor in a hospital as they wait to see a doctor.Images online, posted by shoppers, show supermarket shelves lying empty after panic buying by worried locals.All transport links in Wuhan were locked down in a desperate bid to stop the spread of the bug.Wuhan authorities are responding to the rapid spread of the virus by building a ,-bed hospital dedicated to patients infected with coronavirus.Pictures show construction diggers moving earth to lay the foundation for the hospital that officials say will be completed by February .Wuhan authorities said the city it will be on a , square-foot lot and will be modelled after the makesht the Xiaotangshan SARS hospital in Beijing that was built in .This comes as it emerged on Thursday that nine people in the UK are being treated for suspected coronavirus.Five patients are being treated in Scotland as well as one more in Belfast, Northern Ireland, it has been reported.A further three — believed to be from England or Wales — are also being tested after feeling unwell.Officials claim a further five ­people have been checked out and given the all-clear.Latest figures suggest the number of cases in China has now soared above  with other victims hospitalised in Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea and the US.And with the virus spreading all over the world questions are being asked about how local authorities in Wuhan dealt with the outbreak in recent weeks.The central Chinese city, bigger than London, is the epicentre of the crisis with the virus believed to have originated from snakes at a live animal market in December.Last week, it emerged that the bug can be passed from human to human – yet authorities in Wuhan only locked down its transport links on Thursday.Officials in the Chinese capital have scrapped events including temple fairs, which usually attract thousands of tourists.Beijing authorities announced on social media that the move was to help epidemic prevention and control.Beijing Tourism Net said the Beijing Ditan and Longtan Temple Fairs -

in another sign the city was unprepared for the panic buying such an outbreak would inevitably cause.Guan Yi, a Hong Kong–based infectious disease expert, believes a “bigger” outbreak is certain while accusing officials in mainland China of a “dereliction of duty.”The expert, who helped identy another coronavirus named SARS in , says “we have passed through the ‘golden period’ for prevention and control.”He told Caixin: “What’s more, we’ve got the holiday traffic rush and a dereliction of duty from certain officials.”Dr Yi said the current outbreak could be  times worse than the SARS crisis.He said: I have experienced so much and never felt scared. Mostare controllable, but this time I am scared.The expert claims he had to escape Wuhan yesterday after witnessing the jaw-dropping lack of preventative measures enforced by local officials.Now several major cities, including the capital Beijing, have followed Wuhan in banning public gathering during the New Year celebrations.This is another sign that China is expanding its efforts to contain the virus which started last month – but is it too little too late Many residents in Wuhan think so.Social media users in the city have blasted authorities on Weibo for waiting weeks to put the metropolis on lockdown.Xiao, , a primary school teacher in Wuhan, told : When I saw the news when I woke up, I felt like I was going to go crazy. This is a little too late now. The government’s measures are not enough.Others criticised local authorities on the social media  Weibo as #PrayforWuhan was trending.One said: It’s been a month since the first case was discovered and only now do they think of closing the city  This Wuhan emergency response is a little slow, right   Another added: The government needs to address this. If things become too expensive, people will definitely panic and when people feel unsafe, terrible things happen. Right now people are fighting over supplies, soon they may just be fighting.”Locals have shared images of their stockpiles of instant noodles and snacks on the social media  Weibo.One wrote: No more going out... so I won’t get sick. Hope Wuhan can get some support soon.It is unusual of citizens to express such outrage at the Chinese government on the countrys microblogging site.Supermarket shelves are empty as residents have started stockpiling goods to keep themselves isolated at home to avoid contracting the virus.Images shared online show food prices have spiked in Wuhan.Cake Liu left Wuhan last week after visiting her boyfriend there and said everything was normal then, things have changed rapidly.She said:didnt sleep much yesterday. He disinfected his house and stocked up on instant noodles. Hes not really going out. If he does he wears a mask.Police, SWAT teams and paramilitary troops have been out on the streets in Wuhan patrolling the railway stations as authorities have banned travelling on subways and ferries.The airport and train stations have been shut down to outgoing passengers.Petrol stations have been rammed with motorists trying to get as much fuel as possible amid rumours reserves had run out.Pharmacies have sold out of face masks, residents said.An Irish teacher in Wuhan has describe the city as a ghost town as hes been hold up in his flat.Ben Kavanagh told RTE Radio’s Morning Ireland: “You are allowed out, but there are so many rumours and people are worried, it’s better not to.“It’s almost like a ghost town.I have enough water for a few more days, but I will probably have to head out to the shops for food.“I have no idea what to expect.Seven million people in Huanggang, which is  miles away, have been told not to leave after there were confirmed cases.Suspended transport services have been put into effect in the smaller cities of Chibi, Xiantao, Zhijiang, Qianjiang, Xianning, Huangshi and Enshi.In Zhijiang city, all public venues have been shut down except hospitals, supermarkets, farmers market, gas stations and drug stores, Hubei Daily reported.Indoor entertainment venues in Enshi city have also been shut down, it said.Dr W. Ian Lipkin, a US epidemiologist at Columbia University who advised China and the World Health Organisation during the SARS epidemic, said infected victims outside Wuhan would continue to spread the disease.He said: “The horse is already out of the barn.Coronavirus is an airborne virus, spread in a similar way to colds and the flu.The virus attacks the respiratory system, causing lung lesions.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract , it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.There is no vaccine for coronavirus.In  an outbreak of a similar virus, SARS, infected more than , people in  countries before it was brought under control, killing  of those worldwide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was also signed by European Council President Charles Michel. It means the UK will all but definitely leave the EU at pm on next Friday, with a transition period where nothing really changes for  months. Brexit took so long that the Presidents who originally arranged the deal - Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk - have finished their terms and been replaced.The deal became UK law yesterday when the Queen granted her assent and there is now just one step left - for the European Parliament to back it on January . But it will only be the start of trade talks which have to reach a deal by December  - otherwise the UK will crash out of the EU without a trade deal. EU chiefs have warned the -month timetable is not workable, especially as they can only really start proper trade talks in March. Ms von der Leyen tweeted: Charles Michel and I have just signed the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU, opening the way for its ratication by the European Parliament. Mr Michel added: Things will inevitably change but our friendship will remain.We start a new chapter as partners and allies.  Boris Johnson hailed the passing of the deal this week, saying: At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but weaposve done it.

The leadership contender suggested the party could adopt a new model which would set an example of good practice to the Tories and other parties. Labour has become only the second political party after the BNP to be investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commissionover its handling of antisemitism with the organisation expected to report soon.Thornberry said the new man or woman at the top should use the political capital they have when they begin in the role to deal with the issue hard. She told the Mirror: Itaposs been a horrible thing but, trying to be as optimistic as possible, I think thatwe worked with the equality and human rights commission and set up a model for how you deal with disciplinary matters on anti-Semitism, and you could use it more widely as well, that could actually be an example of good practice that the Labour Party could then start being. Thornberry believes the party should have acted faster to stamp out abuse. She denied that a controversial report drafted by Shami Chakrabarti was a whitewash but said the problem was that the party spent too long faffing and not implementing it. Thornberry says she will be guided by the EHRC report but that is likely to be independent or quasi independent. She said: Letaposs see what the, the equality and human rights commission say, I suspect that theyaposre going to want to have something which is, you know, either independent or quasi independent - I will be guided by them, and I will hope that once the leadership competition is over that we will have their report, we canapost wait, weaposve got to go, weaposve got to sort it out. So with their guidance I will do what they recommend, and I will work with the Board of Deputies and ious other interest groups and make sure that we have something which everyone can have confidence in, so that we can finally move on. At the  Labour Party Conference Emily Thornberry let rip at the sickening iniduals who she said were exploiting support for Palestine as a cover for their hatred of Jewish people. Thornberry also took aim at Jeremy Corbyn’s inner circle after the election.She said anyone implicated by the Equalities and Human Rights Commissioninquiry into antisemitism in the party should be “out the door immediately”. The party has been dogged by accusations that it was not taking allegations of anti-Semitism among its members seriously enough. Anti-Jewish abuse led to former Liverpool MP Luciana Berger to leave Labour while other Jewish MPs including Ruth Smeeth, Margaret Hodge and Louise Ellman spoke out about suffering attacks from members and those claiming to be Corbyn supporters.   Jeremy Corbyn also faced criticism personally for acting too slowly to tackle the issue.   His critics accused him of having a blindspot when it came to anti-Semitism. Thornberry is not the only leadership contender to have criticised the partyaposs record. They have all signed up to a series of pledges proposed by the Board of Deputies of British Jews but Rebecca Long-Bailey has faced a backlash from some of her supporters for doing so.

Mandeep Singh Chatha’s off-licence has become a tourist attraction in Wolverhampton after he erected the sign in orange lettering. Customers have been lining up to take selfies outside his Singh’sbury Local that – some say – looks like a Sainsbury’s. But former sandwich delivery driver Mandeep, , insists there is an innocent explanation, saying: “I decided on the name. My name is Singh and it’s on Bushbury Road. It’s just a coincidence. I think the nearest Sainsbury’s is a couple of miles away so it’s not exactly close and we are certainly not competition. “I am just a small business owner trying to make a living.“People keep stopping in their cars to take pictures with the sign and I’ve had many nice comments. “I have heard nothing from a supermarket which has a similar name, so I see no problem with it. “It’s a dferent logo, a dferent colour, a dferent company. Its a completely dferent.  The former sandwich delivery driver, who opened the store last month, has even registered ‘Singh’sbury Local’ on Companies House. In  businessman Jel Singh Nagra renamed his North Tyneside shop Singhsbury’s. After Sainsbury’s threatened legal action, he renamed the store Morrisinghs – and Morrisons backed the idea.

Saleswoman Michele Kobke says she has been in love with the -tonne jet for the past six years - even describing it as the love of her le. The -year-old German is now planning to wed the Boeing - after first locking eyes on the aircraft through the window at Berlinaposs Tegel airport. Michele says she was first attracted to the Boeingaposs wings, winglets and thrusters. But she has only managed to meet aposhimapos twice, admitting when she canapost be close to the plane she cradles its components in bed at night. But the besotted romantic has an affectionate nickname for her mechanical aposfiancéapos -  aposSchatz,apos which means aposdarlingapos. After six years of only being able to aposmeetapos the aircraft through the glass window of the airport, in September , she was finally able to get up close. In September , she was able to kiss it and even stand on one of its wings in the hangar. And now her dreams are likely to come true as her thoughts turn to marriage. Unlike a traditional wedding, Michele doesnapost want to wear a white gown and veil. Instead, she imagines wearing black trousers and a black blazer on her big day.  She has plans to meet the plane again in a hangar in Amsterdam, on March , . While her friends and family have accepted her relationship, her family are not interested in meeting Schatz and she wants her wedding to be an intimate affair. The time in the hangar was the most beautul moment of my le and when I was with him, we enjoyed our time together, we kissed and I caressed him, Michele said. The hangar is home for Schatz and me we can enjoy our time together undisturbed there. I plan to move into the hangar one day and my biggest dream is to be with Schatz and to live with him. I also want to marry him in the hangar and spend the whole night with him. I wouldnapost want to put on a white dress, but dress really smartly with black trousers and a black blazer. I want to have someone to marry us and say, aposdo you want to marry your -apos and I say, aposyesapos, we kiss and then Iaposm immortalised with him and we can be together forever. Michele has met him twice so far - both times last year. She spends time with parts of the Boeing to stay connected to aposSchatzapos while they are apart. I sleep with my darling every night, either with real components like the spoiler, flap track fairing and tank valve or five-foot-two model intimacy is part of our relationship.  Experts call this type of love affair objectophilia, where a person is attracted to an inanimate object. People with this preference may have strong feelings of attraction, love and commitment to certain items or structures of their fixation. Some objectophiles believe in animism and a sense of reciprocation based on the belief that objects have souls, intelligence and feelings and are able to communicate.

Emma Gale was diagnosed with polycistic oies aged , with doctors delivering the mortying news to her and husband Spencer that they were unlikely ever to have kids. But just two years later Emma, who had started to look into fostering or adopting with her hubby, when she fell so ill that she couldnapost even stand up. After rushing to hospital, it was revealed that Emma was two months pregnant - to the astonishment of both her and her husband. The proud mum, now , went on to have a whopping ten successful pregnancies, giving her one of the biggest broods in Britain. Now the walls of the coupleaposs five-bedroom house in Whitstable, Kent, are adorned with over  family photos showing their army of kids - the eldest of whom is , with the youngest aged just one. Emma works at the local Tesco to support the family, often getting home from her sht at . in the morning - giving her only a few hours of respite before an especially hectic school run begins. All the children apart from -year-old Oliver - who works in Michelin-starred restaurants in France and Ibiza - still live with their parents.

But while le for the Gales can be hectic, they say they wouldnapost change it for the world. Emma said: We always mix up names. Especially when they are being hooligans. Although the couple insist they have no favourites, Spencer has a special bond with Sidney and Isaac, as he delivered them himself at home, with the help of a midwe over the phone. The couple say they work hard as a team to provide for the children - with Spencer working seven days a week at the Harbour Garage and Emma up to four night shts during the week. Emma added: Because we have ten children, people automatically assume we get benefits - but we donapost. Spencer, , said: What is nice is our own work ethics have reflected on our children. Oliver works an awful lot of hours he works all the overtime he can possibly get.  Emily is full-time at Canterbury Christ Church in Medway and works a lot of hours. I think it is nice for us as parents and is really reflective of us. After Isaacaposs birth - and a warning from doctors - Emma and Spencer have decided not to have more children. She said: I was told I could haemorrhage or get blood clots. But I have always been lucky and I have never had any complications. The couple admit money is very tight, so they work extra hard to make sure their children do not go without - and saved £ a week to cover the expensive festive season. Emma said: Donapost get me wrong, they arenapost spoiled children and donapost have anything during the year, except for birthdays and Christmas. We make sure they do their club. They donapost get pocket money, butthey want to go out with friends we try to give them some - everything has to be scheduled so we know what we are budgeting for. Emma does just one big grocery shop a month and doesnapost beat around the bush when it comes to cooking. She added: They donapost have a choice - they all have the same, and it is easier for me.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA wedding planner was left sponging down a sobbing, naked bride after a last minute plan to fix some last-minute belly bloating went catastrophically wrong. What should have been the happiest day of her le was completely ruined because she spent the day knocking back detox shakes, resulting in disaster when she gambled on a fart and lost in a big way. She ended up ruining her £, dress, but refused to let that get that stop her from having a first dance with her husband in front of their nearest and dearest. But things went from bad to worse and ended up with the couple feeding each other wedding cake with poo-stained hands. The wedding planner was first alerted to the issue when she heard the dreaded words we have an issue over her headset. She took to Reddit to share the horrying details, which she admits still make her cringe. Her post has attracted more than , comments with most users being pretty grossed out by the turn of events and others labelling her a hero and a champ. Things didnapost exactly start well, and the planner claims the bride had been quite the bridezilla from day one. She wanted the reception to take place in a historic barn at one of the family properties, which caused numerous issues.  It had no water or electricity, leaving the planner to arrange for a bank of generators, buckets of water, additional auxiliary tents - as the barn wasnapost big enough to house all the guests. After hearing what had happened the planner told guests there would be a short delay before heading to the loo to help her poor assistant, who was cleaning the bride off with toilet paper. She claims the bride had let out a substance no human body should emit. She writes: Iaposm just looking at her manicured nails. Residue of diarrhea are just embedded in her nail bed. I start trying to scrape the poo out with a fabric stain wipe.  But the bride insisted the show went on. Despite the stench that she brought out of the bathroom with her - which the groom noticed - the newlyweds took their place on the dance floor to start the choreographed number. The planner writes: As the groom spun his bride around, hand on her waist, he is squishing the poo up the insides of the waist trainer, up and out the back waistband. To our horror, we watch as a oily stain spread across the mid back of the gown. As we are still cringing from this, the groom sets his hand firmly in the middle of the poo stain.

Kharn Lambert, who lives in Wuhan, is concerned about his -year-old grandmother, Veronica Theobald, who has COPDand is visiting him from the UK. She is running low on medication and is unable to travel home because flights out of Wuhan have been grounded until further notice. The PE teacher, from Lancaster, Lancashire, left his home for the first time in days on Friday to buy food, and he wore a mask and immediately washed his clothes and had a shower when he ed from the largely deserted streets. The -year-old said panic and fear had settled over the city of million people, which has been locked down in a desperate bid to control the SARS-like virus that has killed at least  and infected more than  others. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. Mr Lambert said the cityaposs normally bustling streets are now dead with public transport halted and people forced to stay in Wuhan during the Lunar New Year holiday, which is usually filled with public celebrations and feasts. Residents have been told not to travel and the streets are largely deserted, creating an eerie scene that is like something out of a Hollywood film. Mr Lambert, who has been teaching in Wuhan for six years, toldfrom his home: Itaposs hard to describe the feeling really, itaposs not like anything Iaposve experienced before, knowing that youaposre in a city that is essentially a no go zone seems like something from a movie. At the moment I donapost have any personal fears, I am doing what I can to keep myself safe.  My only fear is my grandmother, she is  and visiting me here in Wuhan, she has COPD and is very vulnerable. She was due to fly home next Monday, but her flight was cancelled. She has enough medication to last her another week or so, but I am worried about how I am going to get her more medication. However, I am in contact with the British Embassy to resolve the situation, and hopefully get her more medication or evacuate her from the city. Mr Lambert said he left his home for the first time in days on Friday to stock up on supplies and he took a number of precautions to protect himself. He said: I left the house for the first time today. I had to go and get some food shopping, but as soon as I got home I wiped down all the packaging with disinfectant, threw all my clothes straight in the wash and showered.  I was scared that I might bring something into the house that would infect my grandmother. Essentially I just wore my every day clothes and a mask, I just made sure that I didnapost come into close contact with other people while I was out. Describing the mood in Wuhan, he said: The atmosphere is very sombre, Wuhan is normally a vibrant city, but I think people are starting to understand the seriousness of the situation now and only leaving houseabsolutely necessary. The majority of restaurants, bars, entertainment centres are closed, those that are open are empty. Yesterday, there was a sense of panic and fear, but I think that was caused by the way the lockdown was handled. News about the lockdown started to trickle out around am in the morning, eight hours before the lockdown started, but most people were in bed at that time so essentially they only had three or four hours to prepare for it when they woke up.Thataposs where the panic or fear set in for most people and thataposs why we saw people dashing for the supermarkets and we saw all of these scuffles.But I went to the supermarket today and the atmosphere as I said is very sombre now. Mr Lambert is hoping his grandmother will be able to fly back to the UK soon, and he isnapost surehe will join her. He said: I am unsure about what I will do at this moment. I think I will keep an eye on the situation and listen to the advice of the Foreign Office and my employers. About  to  Britons live in Wuhan, he said.  The Foreign Office had advised against all but essential travel to the city. Mr Lambert hailed the medics who have been run off their feet working on the front line to treat infected patients and prevent the virus from spreading. He said: Itaposs easy to bemoan and criticise the response from the government here in China, but this really couldnapost have happened at worse time for China, and I donapost think they could have contained it any better than what they have.People have been travelling for weeks and weeks preparing in advance for the Chinese New Year, so I want I just want to say I am with Wuhan, and I want to thank all those on the front line that are dealing with this crisis. Earlier, an Irish teacher living in Wuhan told how he had been holed up in his flat for two or three days as the outbreak unfolded. Ben Kavanagh, who is on a break from work due to the Lunar New Year holiday, said he would have to leave his home soon and venture out into the ghost town to stock up on food.  When he does, he will wear a surgical mask over his mouth and nose and swimming goggles over his eyes to protect himself. Mr Kavanagh told RTE Radio’s Morning Ireland:“You are allowed out, but there are so many rumours and people are worried, it’s better not to. “It’s almost like a ghost town.” Mr Kavanagh said there were fears the virus can spread through contact with the eyes and as a result people were wearing eye protection in addition to masks. He added: “I have enough water for a few more days, but I will probably have to head out to the shops for food.” The teacher plans to wear a mask over his face and swimming goggles over his eyes when he leaves his flat.  “I have no idea what to expect,” he said. He said a dual carriageway near his home is normally very busy but is now quiet, and Mr Kavanagh has heard that the price of some items at the supermarket, including celery, had tripled amid the panic in Wuhan. A British teacher working in Wuhan said he has been told not toto the city after he left earlier in the week to go travelling. The former Leeds University student, who asked to remain anonymous, said he lives near the live animal and seafood market where the outbreak is suspected to have occurred. He told the PA news agency: Iaposve been told not toto China as itaposs in lockdown around the city and my school is closed.  I plan on continuing to travel past my planneddate by a couple of weeks and thenthe place is still a no go, go back to the UK andwhen I can. Itaposs a pain as all my stuff is in my flat and Iaposm really sad as I love my job and hope to be back as soon as possible. If I hadnapost been out the country when I heard about the lockdown - a few hours before it happened - I would have got out the city with all my stuff and come back to the UK. He said the outbreak started before Christmas but it took several weeks before panic started to spread: There wasnapost any visible panic but the parents of kids were wanting information from anyone before the government released any. Then all the information was released New Yearaposs Day and in the early hours of the morning they closed down the market. I walk through that market daily. It was your typical Asian meat market, with everything on display from legs of meat to crabs and fish. The Chinese government have said that illegal sales did occur inside which is where the source is but there was no indication of this from the outside.  Most of my mates are out of the city for the spring festival but a couple are still there and feeling scared mixed with concern. Itaposs mainly inconvenient for them as they canapost do anything at all whilst theyaposre there, apart from stay inside. I donapost know whataposs happening with the jobs or businesses that wonapost be doing anything. He said he was hoping toto the city at the end of Februarythe city reopens. Videos have emerged on social media showing people with suspected cases collapsed in the streets or on floors at hospitals and clinics. Another clip allegedly shows three dead bodies on the floor of a Wuhan hospital as a corridor is packed with patients wearing masks and staff in protective suits. The virus has killed at least  people and infected more than  others during in China, where at least ten cities are on lockdown, essentially trapping more than million residents. The new strain of the flu-like virus has started to spread around the world, with confirmed cases in the US, Singapore and South Korea, and more than a dozen people being tested in the UK after they showed signs of the disease. In China, Lunar New Year celebrations have been cancelled and entertainment venues, including Shanghaiaposs Disney resort, have been shuttered in a desperate bid to prevent the disease from spreading even further. A section of the Great Wall of China has also been closed to tourists. In a statement, the Shanghai Disney Resort said: In response to the prevention and control of the disease outbreak and in order to ensure the health and safety of our guests and cast, Shanghai Disney Resort is temporarily closing Shanghai Disneyland, Disneytown including Walt Disney Grand Theatre and Wishing Star Park, starting January , . We will continue to carefully monitor the situation and be in close contact with the local government, and we will announce the reopening date upon confirmation. The theme park had planned a Year of the Mouse celebration to coincide with Lunar New Year festivities and the beginning of the Year of the Rat.  It is one of the busiest weeks of the year for Shanghai Disneyland. There are fears the new coronavirus will spread rapidly as hundreds of millions of Chinese residents travel domestically and abroad for the seven-day Lunar New Year holiday, which began on Friday. Hospitals in Wuhan - where the outbreak began late last month - are running out of masks, goggles and protective suits as the number of cases soars. At one overwhelmed hospital, a tent city has been set up in a car park to treat patients because there is no room inside, and workers in Wuhan are racing to build a ,-bed hospital in less than a week to cope with the crisis. In Hong Kong, a couple who fell ill following a trip to Wuhan were caught trying to flee a hospital where they were being put into isolation. It is believed the virus was passed from animals to humans at a market in Wuhan in central China. The market, which traded in illegal wildle and has since been shut down, sold live animals and seafood and many of the first patients had either worked there or visited.

The Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan is now under scrutiny after Chinese officials said the coronavirus originated for wildle sold illegally at the food emporium – now labelled as “ground zero”. Photos taken before its closure in December show a price list of  exotic animals – from snakes to civet cats – were available for sale, says the South China Morning Post. The list included live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, koalas and game meats. “Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door,” said the price list for the vendor called Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Massesm, which also listed a price of  RMBfor koala meat. When asked about claims of a food market selling koalas, a Chinese community leader based in the UK told the Daily Mirror: “I doubt that it’s unlikely you would be able to smuggle them into China.” There were also reports of cages packed with porcupines on sale, alongside endangered pangolins. Sellers saying trade in wildle took place up until the market was shut for disinfection after the outbreak began. It has put the country’s poorly regulated wild animal trade, driven by demand for exotic delicacies and ingredients for traditional medicine, under the spotlight. Conservationists have long denounced the trade in wildle for its impact on bioersity and the potential for spreading disease. Wild, exotic and farmed animals are packed together, described as a breeding ground for disease and an incubator for a multitude of viruses to evolve and make the jump to humans. “The origin of the new coronavirus is the wildle sold illegally in a Wuhan seafood market,” Gao Fu, director of China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Preliminary research suggested that the Wuhan virus was passed on to humans from snakes.  But government medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, also identied badgers and rats as possible sources. It is understood a number of the early sufferers of the coronavirus were employees of the wet market. Hu Xingdou, an independent political economist, said Chinese people’s love for eating wildle had deep cultural, economic and political roots. He said: “While the West values freedom and other human rights, Chinese people view food as their primary need because starving is a big threat and an unforgettable part of the national memory.”  The Cultural Revolution, lasting from  to , a period of political and social chaos caused by Chairman Mao, saw two million people die and millions more left battling starvation. It followed a widespread famine between  and  estimated to have killed tens of millions of people. A large Chinese city can have a few hundred wet markets, the main outlets for poultry and meat.  Many cities including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Beijing have banned sales of live poultry and animals in their downtown area. But the markets are still common across the country. While most urban homes now have refrigerators, many in rural areas and low income urban renters still do not own one. Mr Hu added: “While feeding themselves is not a problem to many Chinese nowadays, eating novel food or parts from rare animals or plants has become a measure of identity to some people.” Trafficking of wild species requires special licenses but regulations can be loosethey are commercially farmed. Bats are thought to have spawned the coronavirus SARS, which in  - killed hundreds of people in Asia.

Footage shows the woman holding the bat with enormous chopsticks and nibbling on its wings. Bat soup is a delicacy in the country and a popular dish in Wuhan, where the virus originated. While the woman appears tentative about her meal, her partner gets stuck in, removing the bataposs skin and and pulling the meat from bones.

Other suspected cases have been reported in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, UK, the US and Vietnam. Researchers in China claimed the fatal strain of coronavirus shares a common ancestor with a virus found only in fruit bats.In a statement, the researchers said: “The Wuhan coronavirus’ natural host could be bats … but between bats and humans there may be an unknown intermediate. Bats are popular in Chinese medicine, believed to cure a range of illnesses like malaria and and coughing.  Its faeces is thought to cure eye ailments. The disease is little understood and scientists now claim the virus could stem from snakes. The WHO on Thursday declared the outbreak an emergency for China but stopped short of declaring the epidemic of international concern.Dr Tedros, the director-general of WHO, said: We know that most of those who have died had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease, that weakened their immune systems.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets.

ahead of Galashiels, Hawick and Selkirk.But the Chief Executive told the towns Community Council she thinks Peebles should now be first on the priority list for a new school.Ms Logan explained: ldquoAt the moment my view is, and this is only my view, this has not even endorsed by the Council as yet, is that given the constraints that we have around what will be available financially, the Scottish Government have been really helpful in that they are offering their full support and we will make a bid late spring for funding through the schools programme.ldquoThere will obviously be a financial settlement from the insurance.\"But we need to find the best way forward, so my expectation is that we will retain the Sports Complex because it is undamaged and pretty new, we will also retain the Millennium Wing because again itrsquos not that old and is entirely usable.ldquoI would imagine that we will probably end up taking away everything  and replace it with something new.\"What that will look like, I have no idea. But what it will be is something that is modular that we can add ontowe need to for capacity and we will want to talk to the community about what  we might want to put into that site.A consultation will take place asking for local feedback on community space and the possible provision of health and social care.She added: ldquoSome people have said to me that they want to knock all of the school down including the fairly new bits, realistically that wonrsquot happen and itrsquos not the right thing to do. I think itrsquos important that we make sure people understand the parameters within which we are working so we can have some sensible conversations and that we try and accommodate as much as we can in there.Meanwhile, a major operation is underway to get the students back to their classrooms at the beginning of February.The Chief Executive said: ldquoWe put in arrangements for  plus pupils to be accommodated at locations in Peebles, Galashiels Academy and the Langlee complex.ldquoThat has been generally very successfully and the feedback from that has been positive. I absolutely acknowledge that itrsquos not perfect but it has done the job we needed it do to.Senior students are currently sitting prelim exams in the Sports Complex and this will continue until the end of January.Temporary classroom units are being erected within the school grounds and pupils are to be accommodated in unaffected areas of the building.ldquoThere are still huge amounts of work going on and we will go right up to the wire but Irsquom confident we will achieve it, added Ms Logan.The Council has decided on a phased approach with S to S students starting on Monday, February  and S to S working from home and ing the following day.Ms Logan said that there has been ldquocompromises in the education offer over the last few weeks but is assuring parents that from the beginning of February it will be ldquobusiness as usual.Demolition work on the damaged building has been completed and restricted access has been implemented.The council boss has assured parents that children will only be able to access safe routes throughout the school building.Ms Logan added: ldquoOne of the things we did lose in the fire was the vast majority of pupil toilets so what wersquove now got on site is the long term temporary arrangements supplemented over the course of January.To ensure pupil safety, traffic will enter the site from a new access via Craigerne Road located at the back of the school.Ms Logan is meeting with insurers this week to discuss a settlement figure which will help form the direction of the future of Peebles High School.She added: ldquoAll of what we are doing is going to be sustainable for whatever we do in terms of the proper rebuild.\"What Irsquom trying to reassure you is that wersquore not doing things that are very temporary, whatever we do, we will be looking to the future.Community councillor Graham Mackie commended the local authority on doing a ldquoremarkable job and said any criticism of the Council during this trying time was unnecessary.He said: ldquoIt has been thought for several years that we needed a completely new high school but possibly therersquos a silver lining here in that we can end up with a high school that will meet the needs of the current population.\"But the council chief told members that ldquoessentially this is the replacement.She explained: ldquoWhen it comes to looking at high schools and replacement we would always look to retain what is still workable.\"In the case of the bits we are talking about in terms of Peebles High site they are really not that old.

A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness.

And it ainrsquot pretty. In fact, itrsquos getting downright scary, especially as every week the narrative seems to sht closer to the isive and damaging - but also very deliberate - culture wars being waged in Trumprsquos America.We witnessed this first hand over the last couple of weeks with the grim spectacle of groups of well-spoken middle class white men, mostly of a certain age, being rounded up and brought into television studios to sit on sofas next to black women and explain to them not only what racism is and is not, but also why theirlived experiences of it are worthless. And, when the women speakers pointed out the irony and injustice of this set-up  Calm down dear, yoursquore getting hysterical.Question Time provided perhaps the most eye-watering example of this when actor Lawrence Fox - who had been invited to sit in the ldquovoice of the people chair - unleashed a shocking but very revealing attack on a mixed-race member of the audience who suggested Meghan Marklersquos treatment by the media and others had been racist.:The curse of the House of Windsor: how love has torn apart the royal familyMr Fox, a Harrow-educated member of an established acting dynasty known for his role in the detective series Lewis, tore into the woman - who it turns out is an academic researcher in race and ethnicity - talking over her, aggressively calling the suggestion of racism ldquoboring, adding imperiously: ldquoWersquore the mostly tolerant, lovely country in the world.\" The actor compounded matters by using the tired and predictable ldquoyoursquore the racist defence when quite reasonably questioned on how a spfing white chap like him could be so sure about what racism is and is not.:Netflix chief confirms interest in deal with Harry and MeghanI donrsquot doubt that from Mr Foxrsquos privileged perch, Britain is indeed tolerant and lovely.

Laughably, most of the similar types Irsquove met in le honestly believe they earn their opportunities on merit.The ennui of privilege, eh  They tend to be bored with uppity totty of all races, of course. Theyrsquore probably terribly fed up with feckless poor people banging on about foodbanks, and moany, chippy Jocks, too.Itrsquos the soaring confidence of such attacks and pronouncements that really concerns me, however, the increasingly loud and proud tone of them, the whf of US right-wing s like Fox News, Breitbart and One American News Network.Indeed, rather than apologising or stepping back from his embarrassingly outburst on Question Time, Mr Fox, who has been roundly criticised by his profession, saw fit to launch a defence of his actions, including a barrage of mocking, wince-inducing tweets packed with right-wing US tropes around ldquoliberals and ldquowokeness. Whatrsquos going on  We simply wouldnrsquot have tolerated such behaviour in public  years ago.But with Boris Johnson in Number , a man who defends his writings about ldquopiccaninnies with ldquowater melon smiles, ldquobum boys ldquogirly swats and how voting Tory will ldquogive your we bigger breasts, I suppose such behaviour has both permission and a champion.Make no mistake, the faction of the Tory party that has taken over Britain in the wake of Brexit will revel in and stoke culture wars of this kind. It feels threatened by attacks on pale, male stale dominance, of course. But such isiveness also works as the ultimate distraction technique, stealing our focus away from the deliberate running down of public services, the re-writing of the social contract.And so far itrsquos working a treat."},{"url":null,"title":"return-park-life-edwyn-collins-bandstand-acts-revealed","story":"Edwyn Collins designed and illustrated leaflets for the park in the late s, just as his band Orange Juice was forming.But now he willto the green space as a world-renowned musician to perform at the historic bandstand as part of the award-winning Summer Nights series.The ldquoA Girl Like You singer will join artists including Van Morrison, Primal Scream, Katie Tunstall, Cat Stevens, Altered Images and King Creosote on the bill.Speaking about his previous experience of the park, Mr Collins said: ldquoI spent a lot of time in Kelvingrove in  , when I was an illustrator for Glasgow Parks.

No, we donrsquot have a high-value economy any more, like Irelandrsquos or Norwayrsquos, largely because of being a backwater in the UK for the last half century. But Scotland could still offer the national income of Portugal with the population of Slovakia.:Nicola Sturgeon to set out plan for Scottish independence referendum next weekSo, we can forget the  nonsense about going to the end of the queue or being blocked by Spain. There is now a reservoir of goodwill, especially in the European Parliament, following Scotlandrsquos determined resistance to Brexit. Wersquod be back in, probably within - years according to Kirsty Hughes of the Scottish Centre on European Relations.However, there is one small problem. Scotland would have to be fully independent first. Unless Scotland has a referendum in this transition year there is no longer any prospect of Scotland, as it were, remaining in the European Union as rUK leaves. We may still be under the same regulatory environment as Europe in the transition period, but donrsquot think that can just be extended as in Northern Ireland.Mentioning the Irish backstop is not the way to get a sympathetic hearing in the European Union. Many states are unhappy about Northern Ireland being allowed to remain, effectively, in the European single market without being part of the EU or the EEA.It breaks all the rules. And Scotland can forget about being given similar treatment. Speaking to Brussels officials this week confirms that there will be no read-across to Scotland from the Northern Ireland protocol. They wonrsquot even discuss it.So, there is no half way house. Scotland needs to take the leap into full independence. That means having a central bank and an autonomous currency before Scotland could become a candidate for accession. There are two problems here, but they arenrsquot insurmountable.Scotland would have to formally agree to the Maastricht Treaty, and membership of the euro. It is most unlikely that Scotland would get a formal opt-out from the euro, but it could drag its feet for a very long time, like Sweden. Whether Scotland would want to is another matter. Euro membership has worked well for many small countries.A more dficult issue is convergence. Scotland would have to show that its economy meets the terms of the stability pact, which means having a deficit of less than three per cent. At present, according to the GERS figures, Scotland has a deficit of more than twice that.However, after independence these numbers would almost certainly change. There will be a lot of fiscal give and take between Scotland and the rest of the UK over assets and liabilities.But Scotland would have to show that it is capable of harnessing its currency to the euro, evenit doesnrsquot actually join it. Currency autonomy might be hard to establish , as in the Scottish Governmentrsquos scenario, Scotland keeps using the pound for a decade after independence.: In post-Brexit Britain, Nicola Sturgeon cant keep telling her troops that Indyref is round the corner. It isntIf a nominally independent Scotland were still subject to interest rates operating in a country that is outside the European Union, that would be a dficult sell. The EU is very good at finding novel ways to get round problems like this. But it might take a few years.There may be a trade deal on regulations between the UK and the EU that solves some of Scotlandrsquos accession and border problems. We just donrsquot know. This is one of the imponderables of Scottish independence. It is actually very dficult to make a clear prospectus for indyref when we donrsquot yet know how the UK is going to stand in relation to the EU.But there is a bigger question than all of these: would Scotland necessarily want to rejoin the European Union  Nicola Sturgeon takes it as read, but there would be a debate at the very least. Around a million Scots voted for Brexit and many of them were supporters of independence.Brussels has had some bad press in the last decade. Austerity policies were imposed after  which were worse than in the UK and caused problems across the Mediterranean states. Its behaviour toward Greece during the sovereign debt crisis would have shamed the British Empire at its worst.Brussels stood idly by while one member state, Spain, imposed draconian repression in Catalonia, breaking heads and locking up elected politicians. There was scarcely a word from Brussels, let alone sanctions. Then there is fish.Many in the independence movement believe the EU is a neoliberal club ndash which it is ndash and would be happier with an arrangement like Norwayrsquos which has control of fishing grounds, is not subject to EU rules and has a managed economy. The case for a referendum before Scotland rejoined the EU would seem to me to be unanswerable.At the very least, the SNP could not take it for granted. Unionists will continue to argue that it makes little economic sense for Scotland to leave the Union with the UK, which is where the majority of Scottish exports go. There would be a hard border, currency controls, possibly tarfs.Ms Sturgeonrsquos problem is that the very arguments the SNP used against leaving the European Union ndash freedom of movement, zero tarfs, regulatory harmony ndash apply equally to leaving the United Kingdom.

It can take one big vessel and possibly a small vessel. But in my opinion, we could not facilitate to build two vessels that size so close together because the ground wasnrsquot sufficient enough.He said there was a plan, which he called ldquofine in concept, to build one hull on the slipway then launch it to make way for the completion of a second partly-built hull, but it didnrsquot work.The hulls were called  and .Mr Logan went on: ldquoWe started the  hull and it was moved to the side towards the castle side, and it was all kind of soft ground.ldquoIf you started putting hundreds of tons of units on that then itrsquos going to sink. It wasnrsquot sustainable to do that.ldquoFor the build schedule we had, we couldnrsquot have done it because it would come to a complete standstill on  while  was prepared for launch.He claimed said staff concerns had been dismissed by managers.He said: ldquoItrsquos plain to see ndash the size of the vessels that they were building, and the breadth of them on the berth, that the two vessels werenrsquot going to [fit].ldquoWe needed a mobile crane to go down in between them, and the space as you started building the two together, there wasnrsquot enough space.Askedthe workforce had warned managers about the looming problem, Mr Logan said: ldquoThe management team said they didnrsquot like our negativity.He also said managers caused problems by hiring agency workers to cope with the contract who arrived earlier on site than full-time staff and commandeered vital machinery.He said that left skilled welders with little work bar sweeping up.Mr Logan said design changes had been made ldquoconstantly and there was still not a finalised design for the boats.Without it, the work was ldquolike building a jigsaw when yoursquove got missing parts. Yoursquore never going to complete it.Mr Logan said CMAL and Ferguson managers ldquocame to loggerheads.He said: ldquoThey wouldnrsquot agree on the design so we couldnrsquot move forward, so it just came to a standstill. It was just a stand-off at the OK Corral. Who was going to cave in first He added: ldquoIt came to a situation that CMAL and our own management team couldnrsquot sit in the same building.ldquoThat started affecting the workforce, because the work stopped on the vessels.Mr Hair said the vessels were ldquosignicantly less than half-built, and % of the shipsrsquo design had not been agreed with CMAL, but that more naval architects and marine engineers had been hired to do this job.He said aspects of the design change process were a ldquomess, compounded by the breakdown in relations.He said: ldquoThere were some changes that were agreed but were not signed off because the relationship had broken down to the extent that they were unable to sit in the room, he said.He told sceptical MSPs it would cost poundm to finish the vessels, as they were ldquomuch further away from completion than they look from a distance.Even the one ferry in the water was ldquostill a very long way off completion.: Call for probe into CalMac ferries contractsThe cost of scrapping the ships and starting over again would not be ldquodramatically dferent from the poundm bill for completing the hulls, but would take more time, he explained.ldquoIt is a very signicant number but it is a number that has been based on as rigorous an assessment as wersquove been able to carry out.ldquoItrsquos one where I am confident we can deliver the two vessels for that amount.Tory committee member Peter Chapman said people would find it ldquoabsolutely incredible.He said: ldquoHow the heck do you get to poundm, which is more than what the original cost was to start from scratch with a pile of steel and nothing He added: ldquoThere are assets there and the final figure is now another pound million.ldquoI canrsquot get my head round why it is costing so much more to finish these vessels.LibDem MSP Mike Rumbles said: ldquoThis has been a catastrophic failure. For poundm we have got two-half finished hulks and a lot of red faced officials.ldquoThe Scottish Government need to come clean on what due diligence was done before a contract worth tens of millions was dished out.ldquoRight now there is no evidence that any lessons have been learned or that a nationalised shipyard will be run efficiently and effectively. This needs to be rapidly addressed.The SNP tried to distract from the criticism by criticising the committeersquos Tory chair Edward Mountain for askingHyundai in South Korea could have built the vessels quicker instead.Mr Hair said they indeed could have done it in under five years.Inverclyde SNP MSP Stuart McMillan said: ldquoThe Tories have presided over decades of decline in Clyde shipbuilding.

The rise follows similar increases in previous reports. Politicians celebrate, a new data point is plotted on a graph, workers keep on slogging and the country moves on, apparently more buoyant and prosperous than it was three months ago.But behind such figures is a truth that is becomingly increasingly hard to ignore: that the measures of old mean little in todayrsquos unequal, poverty-marred society where work no longer pays and jobs for le are few and far between. We might be going out to work of a morning, but it no longer follows that wersquore paid enough to live on, that our work is secure and dignied, or that wersquoll still be going to the same job next week, month or year. Rises in employment are little cause for celebrationthey donrsquot take account of the kind of employment they measure.Take, for example, the most recent ONS statistics on zero-hours contracts, which show , people in Britain employed with no guarantee of any work at all. These figures show an epidemic when compared to the , people on such contracts in . What they donrsquot show is the impact that such insecurity and precarity has on someonersquos le: shts cancelled with an hourrsquos notice no way to plan ahead financially in direct competition with colleagues for work, and little possibility of taking on a second job when yoursquore permanently at the whim of your first one. The top-line success of Britainrsquos employment figures includes these people.It also includes, when you dig deeper, a record increase in women working full-time, thought to be driving the overall growth. With feminists having long decried the low-paid, part-time work women find themselves locked in, and the undervaluing of domestic work and care, you might expect this to be welcome. But within the rise are the nearly four million so-called Waspi women affected by changes to the state pension age which mean they will have to work until  instead of . According to the campaign, many report struggling to continue in their previous jobs due to health issues ndash in many cases, caused by the dficult work theyrsquove undertaken for more than  years.And crammed into this figure alongside them is a fall in the number of working-age women out of work to care for children and relatives. Many of those young children and sick relatives havenrsquot gone anywhere instead, women across the country have chosen between this low or unpaid care work and a job that just about covers the costs of paying someone  to do it. Not to mention that analysis by the Fawcett Society suggests that many of these full-time employed women will effectively stop earning in mid-November thanks to the countryrsquos enduring pay gap.In Scotland, the rise appears to have been driven by men gaining work. But a similar increase has also occurred in the nationrsquos levels of in-work poverty, with  per cent of those in poverty also in employment, a figure that has continuously increased since . Low wages, insecure contracts and unscrupulous practices have conspired in Scotland just as where to create a situation where social security may be more lucrative than employment, and where the person who sells you ingredients for your dinner may well be reliant on a food bank for their own.Such blunt figures on employment clearly donrsquot tell us the whole, important, story about work in Scotland and the UK. But even by their own standards, they may not be entirely accurate. In October last year, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Developmentreleased research suggesting the UKrsquos real unemployment figure may be around three million higher, with ldquohidden unemployment ndash those who report themselves economically inactive for reasons such as health, caring or early retirement ndash re across the country. The OECDrsquos assessment serves to show how the cold, hard statistics to which we attach so much weight can easily become just as subjective as political spin.And while the uncomfortable reality of the UKrsquos employment landscape presents a compelling case for dropping our hero worship of black-and-white statistics, itrsquos only one example. Just as governments like that of Scotland and New Zealand have made the case for GDP being a blunt measure when it comes to quality of le, the oversimplied metrics we use to assess the likes of productivity, educational attainment and crime can preclude us from engaging with a range of dferent experiences and interpretations.We will always need data when done well and using the right metrics it can uncover, illuminate and emphasise a range of dferent aspects of our society. But we will also always need a critical eye with which to view it, and a genuine interest in the people and stories behind the numbers. Out of context, statistics are nothing more than pixels on a screen or ink on paper.If we were to devote the same energy to improving the landscape of work across the UK as we do to celebrating largely meaningless statistics, many of these problems could be addressed. But it would require stronger legislation on insecure contracts and poverty wages, and the creation of high-quality, long-term and unionised jobs. It would require restoring the power that has been ripped from the trade union movement and rebalancing the relationships between workers and bosses. And it would mean paying less attention to inaccurate and oversimplied numbers and more to the harsh realities we might be more comfortable ignoring."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-address-dim-sum","story":"THERE will be two good reasons to get merry and misty-eyed in Scotland tomorrow, with both Burns Night and Chinese New Year bumping into each other on the social calendar.

One time, it was because I caused a scene over a stolen jacket, but usually, it was because I was drunk and being a bit of an ****. One thing I can say, though, is that Irsquove never been thrown out of a nightclub because of my beliefs.But this is what appears to have happened at the Polo Lounge in Glasgow. The Polo is a LGBT venue in the centre of town, and according to a video on social media, a woman was kicked out of the club recently for wearing a T-shirt bearing the logo ldquoLGB Alliance. Some people are said to have complained the T-shirt was anti-trans and the woman was told to turn it inside-out or she would have to leave.The womanrsquos reaction to the situation was pretty much the reaction of everyone whorsquos ever been kicked out of a club: it wasnrsquot me. ldquoIrsquove just been removed, she said, ldquobecause trans people, who I didnrsquot even see, said I was threatening to them... Donrsquot I have the right to support lesbians, gays and bisexuals  Trans people, she went on, had the power to have her kicked out because they didnrsquot like an acronym on a T-shirt.:We must fight against the rolling back of trans rightsI realise the street outside a nightclub in the early hours of the morning is not the best place for nuance, but I wish we had more subtlety in this debate. My sympathy ndash instinctively and empirically ndash is with the nightclub I am a supporter of the right of trans people to identy their gender and to have all the rights of that gender. But I also dislike the idea of people who do not agree with a particular view being excluded from a public place.That said, I understand why many LGBT people dislike the LGB Alliance. Take their horrible website for a start. Therersquos nothing critics of trans reform seem to love more than pictures of trans women who do not ldquopass as women, which may explain why the LGB Alliance website is full of pictures of beautul, thin people and women who conform to traditional feminine images ndash they ldquolook like women in other words.Therersquos an unpleasant air of supremacy about the pictures and they make me deeply uncomfortable.Some of the language on the site is also worrying. I was speaking to Michael Cashman, the co-founder of Stonewall, the other day, and, although we didnrsquot talk about the Glasgow case specically, what he said on trans rights was interesting. Young peoplersquos attitudes to gender are in advance of older peoplersquos, he said, but he also believes some of the ways in which trans people have been portrayed are similar to the way gay men used to be portrayed ndash as a threat to children for example. ldquoDangerous to children is a phrase that appears on the LGB website, along with multiple uses of the word ldquothreat. We have been here before.The fact that some gay people have signed up to the LGB Alliance does not change its flaws.They do not explain, for instance, in what way the right to self-identication is a ldquomortal threat to gay rights. They also do not appear to acknowledge that legislating for equality involves a balancing of rights and risks. And they certainly do not explain on whose authority they seek to remove the T from LGBT. They do not have that right.: Scotland can learn lessons from Canada on trans best practiceIrsquom not saying their views are extreme ndash far from it, opposition to trans equality is not an unusual opinion, which is why we should take a nuanced view of the woman who was thrown out of Polo.What she was doing was insensitive and many people will have found her shirt offensive and unpleasant, but in Britain you are allowed to be insensitive, offensive and unpleasantyou want to be.My advice to the woman, had she asked me, would have been to get over herself and not to go to a gay bar wearing that shirt, because why would you want to upset people in a place where they feel safe But my advice to the club would have been to let her stay. Anyone who goes to a gay bar and claims therersquos no T in LGBT is being insensitive and provocative, but the gay bar can be better.It can say: we are a liberal, mature and progressive place we are tolerant and we tolerate even you."},{"url":null,"title":"1917-succession-hand-glasgow-economy-12-5m-boost","story":"Glasgow Film Officesaid big-budget Hollywood films including oscar-nominated  - co-written by Glasgow-born Krysty Wilson-Cairns - and award-winning tv dramas such as Succession - which features Scottish actor Brian Cox - setting up filming in the city ldquogenerated signicant economic activity.:Lets have letime bans for gobby cinema and theatre goersIt comes as Glasgow is set to take a starring role as Gotham City in the latest Batman adaptation starring Robert Pattinson.Council leader Susan Aitken said: ldquoThese latest figures point to the continuing attraction of Glasgow as a location for film production and, crucially, the successes of the councilrsquos Film Office in facilitating that.ldquoMajor productions like  and Succession not only generate signicant economy activity within the city but they profile what Glasgow has to offer to the film and broadcast industry, from our locations to our crews and facilities.:Glasgow screenwriter given Oscar nodShe added: ldquoThis approach has been so successful that I am sure we can look forward to hearing some super news about more major productions coming to Glasgow in the very near future."},{"url":null,"title":"euro-chiefs-sign-brexit-withdrawal-agreement-paving-way-britains-departure-eu-weeks-time","story":"Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen put their signatures to the document in Brussels after the Queen gave Royal Assent to the legislation implementing the agreement on Thursday.Following the formalities in the Belgian capital, the agreement was being taken to London by diplomatic bag for Boris Johnson to sign.

Rationing also generated thousands of enquiries, and bureaux persuaded the government to grant extra clothes coupons to pregnant women. The first CABs in  were in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Stirling and Dundee.Post-war period: Against expectations, the end of the war brought an increased demand. CABs dealt with more enquiries than at the height of the blitz. Housing problems and family breakdowns increased. To meet this demand, the number of CABs began to prolerate.The advent of Legal Aid and the NHS led to a surge in enquiries.s: Housing problems continued to grow as people struggled with the housing shortage, overcrowding, and the end of rent controls.Hire purchase promised le on the ‘never-never.’ For many this led to mounting debts.s: Rents were rocketing, yet many people were still living in slum conditions and homelessness was rising. By  housing problems accounted for a quarter of the . million problems dealt with by CABs across the UK.Divorce reform too led to a surge in enquiries, with family problems representing  per cent of the CAB workload.s: Family, housing and benefit problems remained the top priority, but the consumer boom saw personal debt soar too. Industrial change saw an increase in redundancies and workers’ rights issues.s: Consumerism brought with it two recessions and debt and benefit cases doubled. Employment enquiries rose by  per cent. But debt, stemming from easy credit, became the biggest CAB issue.s: Social security became the top issue and sharp rises in VAT didn’t help. Repossessions and homelessness increased.-: Payday loans, combined with a lack of affordable housing, caused unprecedented levels of debt.

The views are so breath-taking no photo can do it justice, the challenge pushed me past my limits and rewarded me in ways I never expected.“I learned so much about the Chinese culture and had the adventure of a letime. I made the most amazing memories and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone , I will cherish every moment for the rest of my le and feel privileged to have been had this experience and to have raised funds and awareness for CLAN at the same time.”CLAN head of income generation and business development Fiona Fernie commented: “We are so grateful to everyone who undertakes challenges to raise money for CLAN.“We never underestimate how hard people work to raise money for CLAN and it is rewarding to hear when our supporters have had really positive experiences doing so. CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"ScotRail has launched a new campaign encouraging people to stop and think about their own personal safety while travelling or at work.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial. We must give a voice to our local producers in these trade talks while we still can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Could he be right  Was she just imagining racism  But then he complained about the appearance of one Sikh soldier for four minutes in the World War One film .I don’t even want to mention his name but I’m going to have to. Sorry. Laurence Fox’s eruption as the love child of Katie Hopkins and Tim Nice But Dim has had a really profound effect on me. Of course I was yelling at the telly and firing off enraged tweets, but it was deeper than that. His outburst made me question everything I thought I knew about what kind of society we live in and myself.My confident public self was screaming rage at him with verve and enthusiasm. But my internal private chatter box was a frightened mess. For embedded deep within most people for colour who have managed to achieve even modest success is a deep sense of insecurity about our place, our station, and whether everyone is just madly bored of us bleating on about our struggles and feelings.When Fox nonchalantly told that woman on Question Time that she was “boring” and that she was playing the race-card, it was the most horrible confirmation that my inner persecuted minority voice was looking for.: Laurence Fox labels “wokeists” as “racist” following backlash over his Question Time appearance: Laurence Fox hits out at successful black and working class actors who criticise industryI heard my mother’s worried words when I was growing up warning me not to pursue a career in something which was not for “people like us” and to be a doctor . I was reminded of people who warned me against talking about my ethnicity when I first started doing stand-up, saying you don’t want to get pigeon-holed, stick with the knob gags for now . It’s taken us such a long time to not feel embarrassed to talk about issues of race and identity – yet now we have to stop because some actor has ennui  But is he right  Is Piers Morgan right  Are we seeing shadows where there are none  Are we imagining racism  I genuinely felt I was going mad for a while. But I guess that’s the definition of gaslighting.Toxic media bubbleOf course our feelings are not imagined. From the murder of Stephen Lawrence to the Windrush scandal to monkey chants at football matches to the only royal of colour being hounded out the country.The thing that upset me most was the fear that Fox and Morgan speak for the majority of the country. A silent majority who hate us. That freaks me out. I don’t know the answer to that question. My Twitter timeline is a fiesta of racist filth. But when I get out and about and meet people away from the increasingly toxic media bubble, like I did in Grantham yesterday, they restore my faith. I spoke to a group of head hunters who are trying to improve ersity in companies and organisations, not because they are all mad lefties but because it’s good for business and that’s what their clients want. They are even giving all their staff training on trying to overcome unconscious bias which we all have. Someone joked with me that Piers Morgan should try it but it could be like painting the Forth Bridge – a job you can never complete.One poor Sikh dudeI don’t want to believe everyone is racist. What a miserable way to live. I’m no bigot. Hey. Some of my best friends are privileged white men I used to make tea for and whose dry cleaning I used to collect. And I don’t want to be that person who screams “Nazi or Fash” at anyone who has a dferent opinion from me. And people on the left are as capable as being as idiotic and cruel as those on the right. The dference is that those people don’t actually have any real power or influence.But when we have reached a stage where to simply call out racism is now a sin or a crime by people who should know better, on mainstream media s, this country has gone backwards. And what a crying shame that is.I was really unnerved by that Question Time incident. Maybe he was tapping into something dark but undeniable  But mercully his stunning stupidity about the Sikh solider in the film  brought me to my senses. The way he banged on about it being institutionally racist made me go see the film as I genuinely thought it was going to be like an episode of Goodness Gracious Me. There was one poor Sikh dude. Who spoke one line and was on screen for about four minutes in a cast of white men. I almost wept with joy. I’m not going mad. The guy is not some social soothsayer. His breeding may be high but his knuckles scrape the floor. Phew.

We are about to find out just how seriously Brexit will affect the economy and le in general in the UK, something that will no doubt play a signicant part in the ongoing Scottish independence debate.For some, independence and the hope of ing to the European Union represent a sensible response to Brexit for others, it is simply a repeat of the same mistake, perhaps a worse one.Whatever the truth of these great, fundamental questions – based on emotion and competing senses of identity as much as anything  – it remains the case that any democratically elected government must still get on with what is sometimes called their “day job” – ensuring that hospitals, schools, the emergency services and so oneffectively.The clash between Nicola Sturgeon and interim Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw at First Minister’s Questions over police funding was a case in point.It came after complaints from a senior Scottish Police Federation official about leaking roofs in stations and the Scottish Police Authority’s vice-chair about a “structural deficit” in the policing budget.Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf then complained it was “unhelpful” to talk about police stations “falling apart”, describing the suggestion as “hyperbole”. A few hours later, the ceiling of a police station in Broughty Ferry collapsed. The timing may have been almost comic, but such issues are no laughing matter.The First Minister’s response was predictable – Carlaw had “a nerve” to even raise the issue, given the reduction in the Scottish Government’s budget from Westminster.That may serve as a political rejoinder in the heat of the moment, but it only has a degree of power when used against a Conservative politician. It would not work against the police officers on duty in Broughty Ferry. It is no answer to them at all.Similarly, pointing the finger of blame at Westminster over serious problems in the health services does nothing to address the concerns of over-worked medical staff or patients struggling to get an appointment or languishing on waiting lists.And it also is no comfort to anyonethe situation south of the Border is worse.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"reimagined princes street gardens would host 15 major events a year under new business plan","story":"A business plan for the long-awaited Quaich Project would see the redeveloped park used as a catalyst to ldquoreimagine Princes Street and the west end of the city in the next few years.There will be no limit on the number of ticketed events which do not restrict wider access to the gardens in future. The cap only affects concerts and other major events which close off all or part of the park to non ticket-holders during normal opening hours.The business plan, which is due to be discussed by councillors next week, would effectively give the green light for major events like the Summer Sessions pop and rock concerts, the Fly Open Air dance music festival, the cityrsquos festival fireworks finale and the Hogmanay concert in the gardens to continue.The proposed limit on events which restrict public access to the gardens is three times the size of a previous official cap, which has been in place for years. It was effectively relaxed when the council decided to treat an extended series of concerts as one event.The business case also raises the prospect of new medium-sized events being staged in the gardens, such as the ldquoSummer Nights events held in Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow. It is thought there would also be flexibility to accommodate large-scale one-off events involving the likes of the BBC, MTV or the Tour de France.The overall vision for the project, which has been in the planning for five years, is to \"create and sustain a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.\"Income from all-ticket events would help subsidise the staging of smaller-scale events in the gardens, such as a Pride event, cinema screenings, showcases for buskers, school prom events and light shows.Other new events could include theatre productions, traditional arts and culture events, live music performances, spoken word events and family activities. Under the vision for the future of the park, which dates back to the mid-th century, ldquoevery Edinburgh citizen and visitor to the city will have experienced West Princes Street Gardens and the Quaich Project. Community groups would only pay a nominal fee, which could be as low as £, for the use of the gardens for their events under the new financial model, with the city council handling bookings from event organisers and promoters.It is hoped up to £, a year could be generated from the hiring out of the gardens for events and income from the new two-storey ldquogateway centre, although running costs for the new-look gardens are estimated to come to up to £, in future.The Quaich Project, a public private partnership being pursued by the city council and a trust set up by Apex Hotels founder and former Edinburgh Playhouse owner Norman Springford, would see the run-down Ross Bandstand, which opened in , replaced by a ldquoHobbit House-style pavilion for performances and an amphitheatre instead of the existing concrete bowl.A two-storey complex featuring a visitor centre, cafe and corporate hospitality facilities would offer direct access from Princes Street and boast spectacular views of events below Edinburgh Castle. The business plan has been published ahead of detailed designs for the revamp of the park being submitted to the council in the spring. A key aim is to deliver ldquoa balanced programme of activities ranging from small scale community events  learning programmes to festivals and major events throughout the year, befitting a capital city, world class visitor destination and much-loved public lsquogarden.rsquoIt states: ldquoWe will curate the use of spaces and activities throughout West Princes Street Gardens to enable a primary focus on community events which reflect the nature of the spaces involved.\"These include school and family events, lectures and talks, garden and nature tours, traditional art and culture, live music and theatre, heritage and historical programmes. The new facility will be offered at low cost for community groups and schools.ldquoWe will also procure and programme a specic number of major events which will provide high profile and high-income streams to create the affordability to community groups.ldquoWe will promote and market the project to a wide range of community bodies, schools and colleges, event and festival organisers to ensure that a healthy balance exists to enable an active yet tranquil and accessible space across the year.It is hoped that the impact of the Quaich Project will help the west end of the city withstand the impact of the new St James development, which is due to open later this year. Work is also due to be finished within months on a new Johnnie Walker visitor centre in the former House of Fraser department store, while there are plans to turn the former Royal Overseas league building opposite the bandstand into a hotel.The blueprint states: ldquoSitting in the heart of Scotlandrsquos capital, the Quaich Project offers a unique  for promoting a wide iety of activity in a spectacular setting, underpinned by a core aim of providing a mix of events and activities that fulfil our mission.ldquoIt also offers a catalyst for the re-imagining of Princes Street and its environs. With the opening of the new St James Centre and the refocusing of retail activity to the eastern end of the city centre, the project has the potential to drive the context of the area ndash cultural, social, wellbeing and environmental themes dominating a space currently occupied by buses and shops.In his report for next weekrsquos culture committee, place director Paul Lawrence states: ldquoThe completion of the refurbishment and development of West Princes Street Gardens in general, and the redevelopment of the Ross Pavilion and the construction of the associated gateway building in particular, is to the benefit of residents, visitors, event organisers and festivals, and Edinburghrsquos reputation.Donald Wilson, the city councilrsquos culture chief, said: ldquoThis is a very important stage in the project to reimagine West Princes Street Gardens.ldquoThe core focus for the business model is on community access and activity by creating and sustaining a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.ldquoThis is a model where big events that involve exclusive access to the gardens are kept to a minimum, but these will make it possible to offer low cost rental of spaces to community or charitable organisations. Crucially, it proposes no more event days than we have at present.ldquoWest Princes Street Gardens are open almost every day of the year, with early closure for events, mainly in the evenings, amounting to less than % of normal opening times. It is estimated that within the new operating model this would continue.ldquoThe proposed new access route behind the pavilion is estimated to reduce event set up and takedown times by at least  per cent, thus reducing the impact on the gardens.David Ellis, managing director of the Quaich Project, said: ldquoOur vision is to improve the entirety of the gardens with a focus on making them a more enjoyable and accessible place for the benefit of Edinburgh residents and visitors all year round. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"raab uk would have acted differently after us refuses harry dunn suspect extradition","story":"The Foreign Secretary has said the \"UK would have acted dferently\" after the US secretary of state refused an extradition request for the suspect charged with causing the death of Harry Dunn.In a statement, Dominic Raab said the rejection \"amounts to a denial of justice\" and said the Foreign Office believes Anne Sacoolas shouldto the UK.The -year-olds parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn were informed of Mike Pompeos decision to refuse the request in a phone call with their constituency MP, Andrea Leadsom, on Thursday.: US diplomats we charged over Harry Dunns deathThe teenager died when his motorbike crashed into a car outside RAF Croughton in August last year.Mrs Sacoolas, , claimed diplomatic immunity following the crash and was able toto her home country, sparking an international controversy.DisappointmentIn a statement, Mr Raab said: \"I called the US ambassador earlier to express the Governments disappointment about this decision.\"We feel this amounts to a denial of justice, and we believe Anne Sacoolas shouldto the UK.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I want to make sure the Assembly reflects the new opportunity we have and have said to members both publicly and privately that I have to try and set a standard here of respecting everybody no matter who is in that chamber, they are all equal. The people who vote for them are equal. It’s about respect at the end of the day and I have to earn that as well.”The West Belfast MLA said that his take on the dynamics of the new ing Assembly going forward is that “it’s very important that it rises to occasion”. Having met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnston, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Maskey said that both governments need to “respect that as well”. “We’ve got to respect political dference and we have to manage those,” he said. “I had very constructive engagements with them on Monday, obviously the substance of their visits was dealt with by the Executive.”Impartiality in his role as Speaker is a core element of the post, he said.“I had been pushing very hard on securing the funding that was announcement by the Department for Education for West Belfast schools.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

We had to go to Pennyburn. googletag.cmd.push  Derek McCauley, founder member of Shantallow Community Centre. Photo - Deirdre Heaney, nwpresspics  The move was a big culture shock.I saw a very urgent need to get an organisation together to improve the situation.I felt what was needed was a tenants association.The seeds of the Shantallow Tenants Association were sown when the residents began organising bus runs to Moville and Malin.It was a great opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other and there was a general consensus that more should be done for the young families in the area.In , just before the outbreak of the Troubles, Mr McCauley wrote  to the Belfastasking for help as he knew there were a lot of tenants associations in the Greater Belfast area.Groups from across the North advised him how to go about setting up a tenants association.The Highfield Tenants, Association, Amalgamated Corporation Tenants Asso- ciation, Tullycarnet Tenants Association, Lyne Social Club in Larne, North Belfast Tenants Association and the National Federation of Tenants Associations all wrote to me.I received lots of replies and they supplied me very useful advice.Most of these associations were political and non sectarian and I still have those letters.The main theme of these letters was use your politicians, but dont let them use you.The first meeting was held in a small gun club in the area by founder members, Danny Cooley, Tom Doherty, Sally Fleming and Mr McCauley.Mr McCauley was elected as chairman and Mr Cooley was elected as treasurer and it quickly became clear a community centre was needed.We put a questionnaire around the estate asking would they like a centre and what they would like to see in it and we got a great response.The association met with the Housing Trust  and made their case.We met with a lady called Miss MCCullough. She was a great help to us and I think we struck a chord with her, said Mr McCauley.The reason we were successful was because we were non political and non sectarian.When we went to ask for anything we asked politely and we didnt demand it.The Shantallow Community Centre was the first of its type to be built in the city and cost pound,.Its was only supposed to last  years, said Mr McCauley.The centre was soon a hive of activity and people came from across the city to use it.We had a childrens play group, handicraft classes, Irish dancing classes, piano lessons, a childrens disco and a youth disco on a Saturday night.It was the only disco of its kind in the city at that time we had young people coming from Newbuildings and the foot of Bishop Street for that.You would find them standing outside after and they had no way of getting home, so I would have given them a lt in my big yellow Zephyr.Everyone remembers the Zephyr. If I go to a wake in Shantallow people say to me do you still have that big yellow car The list of activities at the centre continued to grow with gymnastics, rollerskating, indoor bowls and bingo.In  they held a cross community festival for all the churches in the area.It was a good time, said Mr McCauley.It was all young families living in the area and on the summer days you would have thought there was a swarm of bees out on the back square but it would just have been all the children.That was before phones and Playstations.The work of the centre stretched far outside its doors with bus runs, dinner dances, outdoor festivals, sports competitions and luncheon clubs.Mr McCauley dedicated countless hours to it, but he said none of it would have been possible without the support of his we, Rita, who sadly passed away two years ago.She was the most important person, he said.We had six children and she had to rear them all.Mr McCauley eventually retired from the Tenants Association in , but not before he shared his knowledge with community groups across the city. A long list of people gave many volunteer hours to the Shantallow Tenants Association and Community Centre.I would like to wish all future communities the success we had and give a special thanks to all those people who made it so successful. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar.

Lyndon Stephens died that morning after battling stoically against illness. His record label, Quiet Arch, was already planning to go into hiatus due to his illness and had planned a farewell gig in the Belfast Empire for that very evening. As fate would have it, it became his wake. I am a firm believer in the human spirit being how people remember you and I prefer to gather other people’s memories for things like this. Ryan Vail: “The man that gave me a career in music, toured me around the world, put me on tv, put me on radio, made me a headline festival artist, got me sound tracking, got me remixing, got me producing, got me talking on some of the most important industry , got me the most prestigious funding awards my manager, friend, label partnerLyndon Stephens.“I was his very first signing nine years ago and stayed with him the whole time. We released together, toured together started labels together, found acts together and had hours of phone calls together daily. “To be honest it’s been so so dficult to comprehend. Im really grateful for the memories we shared together.“RIP Lyndon, thank you for changing my le”Ciaran Lavery: “I first met Lyndon Stephens at Output, Belfast. He didn’t know me or owe me anything but kept putting me forward to talk to the local press that were at the event. “After the show, he askedI’d like to chat to him about working together. “Over the course of the next five years we broke down so many walls and glass ceilings. We spoke on the phone three for four times a day every day. I could call him at ungodly hours and he always answered, he was always there, Lyndon loved to talk. He was an incredible human being with a wonderful family and friends circle. “I know that when any friend musician needed advice of funding I pointed them towards Lyndon andhe had the time, he gave it willingly. I have an incredible amount of memories. I will miss my old friend so dearly, but in truth, I am truly blessed to have met Lyndon Stephens”.Francesca O’Connor, from Quiet Arch ,said “Lyndon Stephens, a man who wanted to make a genuine dference to this world, give the underdogs a  to shine and to show the world the incredible talent coming out of Northern Ireland. “He set up an artist management company, Champion Sound Music and record label, Quiet Arch, to put Northern Ireland artists on the international stage. I will forever be grateful to him for hiring me as a trainee artist manager . years ago. “As a young female with little experience but an eagerness to learn, he gave me a chance. I can only take inspiration from his creativity, decisiveness, determination and unwavering passion to succeed to carry on what he started. “Not long ago, he sent me the poem Go All The Way by Charles Bukowski and I cant think of a better way to describe his tenacious spirit.” She concluded: A loving husband, father, sister and friend, Lyndon is undoubtedly one in a million and will never be forgotten”.Ben Magee, also of Quiet Arch said “Lyndon’s biggest strength, and of those he had many, was when he believed in you, you knew about it. He was never one to shower you with praise, butyou had Lyndon in your corner, he made you feel like you could conquer the world. “A profound, hilarious inidual who was always one step ahead of everyone  in the room, Lyndon never spent a second of his le saying goodbye. “He always had his eyes fixed squarely on the horizon, eyebrows raised, a mad cackle dancing on the corner of his mouth. He was a mentor, a confidant, an always open ear and a friend. And I will miss him dearly.”My memories of Lyndon are very similar to Ciaran’s and probably most other people’s. he was always willing to help and preferred to talk over the other means of communication. If I ever went off the deep end with one of my rants at the music scene here Lyndon would message me quickly to calmly explain how things worked and how I might be right but mostly how I was wrong. It always began with a text message but was always swtly abandoned in favour of a chat. Always knowledgeable and always reasonable I will truly miss the advice and am forever grateful for the counsel. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But with our lives being so busy we often forget the simple activities bring the happiest times and memories. As parents, and childminders too, we can also feel under pressure to always be teaching our children, so this week I’ve combined these two themes, baking and learning. The curriculum for our young children talks about three prime areas of learningand these are Personal, Social andEmotional Development - this is all about learning to share, to wait, taking an interest and participating in activities, being responsible for tasks, having opportunity to feel valued and able to contribute, talking about what you are doing together, asking questions and having a special bond etc. googletag.cmd.push Communication and Language - this is about listening, paying attention, being able to focus and concentrate, being able to follow instructions, naming dferent items and actions, speaking in sentences, asking and answering questions, having a two way conversation etc Physical Development - is about small finger movements and large movements too, it’s about being able to use and control items, objects and tools etc and also self care, personal hygiene, having own likes and dislikes, being safe and using equipment safely etc. If we consider these and look at all that baking involves we can see all the learning that is going on from collecting all ingredients, selecting and organising bowls, spoons, whisks etc, washing hands, putting on an apron, then reading instructions, following a receipe, talking about what next, weighing, counting, pouring, breaking, mixing, adding, stirring, smelling, washing implements, waiting for cakes to cook then cool before sharing and tasting! googletag.cmd.push  Recipes For You To Make Together Scones - g oz self raising flour, g oz butter, g oz caster sugar, ml fl oz milk, pinch of salt . Method Heat the oven to C F Gas . Lightly grease a baking sheet. Mix together the flour and salt and rub in the butter. Stir in the sugar and then the milk to make a dough. Put onto a lightly floured work topand knead. Roll out the dough to about cm thick and shape into scones. Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk. Bake for - minutes until well risen and golden. Then leave to cool on a wire rack and add whatever you like! If you want to add sultanas or choc chips before you bake then why not! Cheese Pancakes -   cup flour,  frac tsp baking powder,  frac tsp sugar,   tsp salt,  egg,  cupof grated cheddar cheese - too much cheese will make them too sloppy,  cup milk ,  tbsp melted butter. Method Mix together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Stir the grated cheddar cheese into the flour mixture until everything is evenly combined. Beat together in a separate bowl the egg, milk and melted butter. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just to moisten. Heat a lightly oiled frying pan over medium high heat. Spoon the batter onto the pan, using approximately   cup for each pancake. Cook till brown on both sides and enjoy! Cupcakes - g butter , it’s a good idea to get the butter out of the fridge much earlier so it is soft!,  large eggs, g caster sugar,g self raising flour . Method heat oven to C   F  Gas . Fill a cup cake tray with  cake cases. Whisk together butter, sugar then add beaten eggs bit at a time, whisking in between. Add vanilla extract and sieved flour then pop the mixture into the cake cases and into the oven for about  minutes. If you’d like to decorate with buttercream after they have cooled , then to make the butter cream mix together g butterand g icing sugarthen add  tbsp milk and food colouringyou like. You can use a spoon or fork to add the buttercream to the cupcakes or even use a piping bag! Biscuits… - p vanilla extract. Method Heat oven to C C F Gas  and line a baking tray with baking   greaseproof paper. Put the butter in a bowl and beat until soft and creamy. Beat in the sugar, then the egg and vanilla, and then the sieved flour to make a dough - knead. If the dough feels sticky, add a little bit more flour. Roll out to about   cm thickness and cut out shapes using a biscuit cutter or rim of a cup. If you feel adventurous then gently press some clean toys into the biscuit - car tracks, lego shapes etcor add sultanas to make a face! Then bake for - minutes before eating!

They often neglect to inform the applicant until the application has been in the system for weeks, causing unnecessary delays and obviously frustration.”“It stands to reason thatwe had a passport office in the north, which would be more accessible to residents from Donegal to Antrim, issues would be easier to resolve.”“In the meantime, our office in South Derry has a supply of blank passport forms and we are happy to sign them for everyone.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s just not about buying equipment and supplying resources, said Mr McLaughlin.Don’t get me wrong, the doctors are amazing in the unit and le savers, but as parents you just don’t bond with them the way you do with the nurses.They are there  hours a daycaring for the babies.The McLaughlins endured a dficult time after the birth of their daughters, with two premature babies to care for.The Twin to Twin Syndrome meant the girls had received an uneven blood supply in the womb and because they were also born early they needed help to feed and breathe.The couple spent many anxious hours by their daughters incubators and during that time they saw first hand the work of the nurses in the unit.Good news or bad news, the nurses are there to celebrate with you or to pick up the pieces, said Mr McLaughlin.They prepared us mentally for everything coming and saw us through it.Many times we saw nurses miss lunch breaks and dinner breaks because the unit was stretched.We saw them missing their children’s or husbands birthdays because the unit was understaffed.One thing about those nurses, their patients always came first.Mr McLaughlin said he fully supported the recent strike action undertaken by nurses and health service staff for pay parity and safer staffing levels.Spending nearly two months with them we saw that they have financial commitments and dfi- culties like everyone . It was very upsetting for us to learn they were being treated dferently from their colleagues in England, Scotland and Wales.If the person who makes these decisions walked in the footsteps of our neonatal nurses for a week, they might think dferently.Just before Christmas, Saorlaith and Soairse deliveredpound, of Foyleside Shopping Centre vouchers to the nurses, which was raised through a raffle and quiz night.This year we organised a stand alone event for our NICU nurses simply because they deserve it and we wanted to let them know how much the public think of them,”said Mr McLaughlin.We have received Facebook messages and thank you cards from nurses we have never met so it just showed us how much it meant to them.The night we left over their Foyleside vouchers the strike was a hot topic and it was the perfect time to reassure the nurses they had massive support in our community and that we understood why they were doing it. It was just nice that the community were there for the nurses when they needed a bit of help and support with the strikes and I know they were over the moon with the Foyleside vouchers.In Saorlaith and Saoirses eyes it was mission accomplished.Earlier this month, the twins delivered the latest cheque forpound,. to the NICU.A spokesperson for Western Health and Social Care Trust said: This is the fourth donation the McLaughlin family have made toNICUas a show of appreciation for the great care Saorlaith and Saoirse received during their time there in .The family has raised a total of pound, for the Unit.Staff in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit are overwhelmed by the incredible generosity of the McLaughlin family, the local community and businesses who have been fundraising to support our premature babies and their families who we care for in the Unit.Thank you to everyone who has donated it is very much appreciated. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development.

Pat Havern, Corey Quinn and Donal OrsquoHare did most of the scoring that day, but Tipperary will be a dferent proposition at the weekend.New Tipp manager David Power, who famously led the county minors to an All-Ireland title in , has an abundance of talent at his disposal, but he will have to without star player Michael Quinlivan.The Clonmel Commercials man has decided to go travelling for a year and his absence is a huge loss to Tipperaryrsquos attack and the countyrsquos bid to regain their status in the top flight ahead of next seasonrsquos championship changes.Promotion is also a must for Down as well, as they too have huge aspirations of avoiding competing in the All-Ireland second tier competition.Down have just emerged from an indferent McKenna Cup campaign.Wins over Fermanagh and Antrim were cast aside when Tallyrsquos team were given a reality check by Tyrone in the semi-finals.Mickey Hartersquos experimental side simply over-powered Down and had too much physicality all over the park.Hopefully, Down will have learned from that game, but second guessing Tallyrsquos team selection ahead of Sunday is a dficult job.Definitely missing Sundayrsquos game will be vice-captain Caolan Mooney, the one player in the camp who has the ability to stand out from the rest. His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night.

planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a so-called bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020

The tourism season in Newcastle is now all-year long and we want to keep the car-park open.Cllr Devlin said that the council was ldquoa victim of its own success in being able to attract the numbers of visitors to the town.She questioned the proposalrsquos contention that Newcastlersquos parking demand ldquosignicantly decreases during the winter months.ldquoIt used to be that we would have parking problems during particular times such as the Festival of Flight and bank holidays. But now as long as its dry, Newcastle is busy and parking is a necessary part of the town centre, she said.ldquoWhen the overflow car park is not being used, itrsquos complete chaos and parking can create issues for residents in nearby folds.She asked council officers when the new overflow car-park would be open for business andthe current overflow area could be kept open in the interim to help with parking demand.Michael Lipsett, the councilrsquos director of active and healthy communities, said he envisaged the work lasting three months and promised that once the necessary planning approval was gained, his department would be preparing to tender for a contractor as soon as possible.Slieve Croob Cllr Andrew McMurray queried whether the car-park would be a ldquoblanket tarmac covering andit would encroach on the green space.He was told that the proposal was to use a synthetic grid which would allow grass to show through so it would look green but would also indicate the car spaces available and one-way traffic system planned.Mournes Cllr Harold McKee welcomed the development as a ldquogreat idea and said parking in Newcastle was ldquoan absolute nightmare at any time of the year.Cllr Devlin suggested that the current overflow parking area should be in continuous use until the new facility is opened.However, Mr Lipsett said he currently did not have the budget available to cover this but would investigate and report back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Philip.jpg","title":"Philip and Helen in tandem at Kildare  ","story":"ON a bitterly cold Saturday morning Phillip and Helen Vint were at the start line for the latest in the East of Ireland Marathon series, at Staplestown, in North Kildare, which also provides half marathon and k alternatives, mostly for partners, like Helen who feel itrsquos nice to be there to support your other half, but who feel that running a marathon with them is pushing things a bit too far, . miles too far to be exact.The temperature was -C when they began running and a sultry +C when they finished and underfoot conditions were slippery by virtue of the frozen ice around the route.So, well done to both on completing what they describe as steady runs for their firsts of , Phillip in .. and fth place and Helen in .. and third place respectively.BornRunSaturday saw a big turnout,  in fact, for the sixth of the BornRun Run Forest Run Series.This week the venue was Gosford Country Park which will also host the NI  Ulster Intermediate and Masters Cross Country Championships next weekend.The only distance on offer this week was k and the route headed out in a loop around the start and continued towards the outer boundaries of the forest.The first k was quite level and took everyone into the scenic forest for k where there were a few small inclines, but overall it was a flat, fast course with a good run in the last k down to the finish line.No-one made better use of the terrain than East Downrsquos Jimmy Sloan, who fairly flew round the course in a superb ., which was almost two minutesahead of the second-placed Thomas Carson . with third place filled by Barry McAuley in ..I believe this is Jimmyrsquos first win in club colours and it certainly wonrsquot be his last, given his present form and continuing improvement, which in spite of hearing later that the distance was allegedly  metres short, nevertheless represents a great effort and time.

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting.

That’s where we are and that’s where we’re moving to now’..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “Psychologically, I think the DUP has played a huge role in creating that because they really did make it a cold house for Catholics,” he told the Irish News.“And there was no need for it. [In relation to an Irish Language Act], they should have been saying: ‘Of course, there will be an Irish Language Act because it’s very important to a lot of people in this community and that it’s a vibrant language in some parts of the north.”He added that he has detected a “distinct change of attitude” beyond nationalist communities towards the DUP’s “Old Testament sort of stuff, the inhumane stuff that they espouse, it is no longer acceptable”.But fellow lawyer Trevor Ringland responded that his focus was on “uniting people”.“Most of the rest of us are focussing on uniting people and as bad as the DUP are I do not think that Arlene Foster feels that the murder of her neighbours was right or justied or in any way necessary,” he said, with an implied criticism of politicians who continue to justy Troubles-era murders. “It is also obvious to most of us now that the promotion of one extreme promotes the other, albeit both have moderated their behaviour somewhat in their pursuit of power.“The only way to pursue a constitutional preference is by making NI work socially and economically with great relations across the Island and between the Islands.“Joe is stuck with me and I with him and both of us – due to the lack of courage of the rwo Governments – with Sinn Féin and the DUP. So we should dry our eyes and get on with undoing the damage their two ideologies caused, bring out the true character othe people here by building relationships and enjoy this beautul place we share.”DUP Upper Bann MLA Jonathan Buckley said Mr Brolly “loves a controversial stunt to generate headlines” but that pro-united Ireland parties’ share of the general election vote shrunk from % in  to % in . “But Joe won’t let the facts get in the way of a headline.” Unionists should be working to make NI “feel like home for everyone” he added.Drink driver who answered call for lt from sister is bannedWill it snow in February   Northern Ireland weather forecast as wintry showers set to hit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingNI snow due to arrive earlier than originally thought - gales now expected too as temperatures set to plummet to -degCPSNI confirm route slow moving ambulance will take - motorists urged to remain patientNI Snow Alert: Experts predict snowfall for next week - subzero temperatures expected across NITwo PSNI officers in hospital after horric attackFatal dog disease Alabama Rot confirmed in NI - DAERA calls for pets owners to be aware of symptoms        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Latest News\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves. The vast majority just wonrsquot be able to do this.ldquoIntroducing policy which isnrsquot fit for purpose could have severe consequences. The impact on consumers must be central to discussions on the future of heating, and cost and disruption minimisedsupport for climate change action is to be forthcoming.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves.

I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
