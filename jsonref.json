It was just plain. We were just trying to figure out how we could jazz it up and we both love Lego so came up with the idea of building an interactive wall that our friends and family could enjoy along with us.\u0027What began as a \u0027bit of a silly joke\u0027 quickly turned into something bigger.Ms Turford said: \u0027It seemed like quite a small and easy project at first but we massively underestimated how many bricks it took to even complete one line so quickly found ourselves scouting around for more.  Ms Turford and Mr Wilkinson (left) stuffed the wall with quirky characters, secret doors and Lego men (right) \u0027We didn\u0027t plan it. It just happened as we did it row by row.

The couple with a box of Lego next to their giant wall \u0027I really thought people would just see it as a wall of bricks and funky bits on it but people genuinely think it\u0027s a brilliant creation.\u0027You just don\u0027t think that many people are going to appreciate something you\u0027ve done so it is very humbling.\u0027Especially when it\u0027s a personal thing and it\u0027s a project you\u0027ve done yourself and put out there. It\u0027s gone a bit bonkers.\u0027The couple sought out the thousands of bricks used in the wall at car boot sales, auction houses and through online sellers - but became frustrated at how quickly they got through them.They say they have no idea how much they spent in total - but gave an estimate of a couple of thousand pounds.And in true Lego spirit, the couple think their creation is \u0027awesome\u0027 and routinely sing the Lego theme song \u0027Everything is Awesome\u0027.Ms Turford said: \u0027I love it all.

They would, however, need to be selected by the Speaker.\u0027As it stands, Britain will leave the EU without a deal if Parliament fails to approve one before March 29 2019.The report also sets out three other plans it hopes will heap political pressure on the PM to perform a radical U-turn and call another referendum.It urges MPs to call debates in the Commons Chamber and to table amendments calling for another referendum which may not be legally binding, but they hope will help their campaign.It also urges MPs to defeat the PM\u0027s deal when it is voted on, or agree to back it only if Mrs May agrees to hold another referendum with remaining in the EU an option on the ballot paper. "},{"url":null,"title":"Car lover spends seven years turning 1969 MK1 Ford Capri collectible worth 14 000","story":"    Chris Taylor (pictured with his mk1 Ford Capri 2000 GT XL), 48, bought the now-vintage model in 1990, when he was just 20 and intended to just use it as a daily \u0027runner\u0027 car.

The couple have denied their rapid relationship is part of a publicity stunt  claiming they are two ordinary people who are both looking for serious and lasting loveGiven that others who have married at first sight — usually as part of a tacky TV experiment — ended up bitterly regretting it, you’d think the odds were surely against them in the long term, despite their euphoria over what Sarah describes as ‘the happiest day of my life’.So is this a crazy publicity stunt or are the pair of them plain crazy?They insist the answer is neither that they are two ordinary people looking for serious, lasting love who reckon this is the best way to secure it.‘If someone had told me I’d end up marrying someone I’d never even met before, I would never have believed them,’ says Paul, who concedes that his shocked family and friends thought he was ‘bonkers’ when he told them.‘There were a few moments when I got cold feet but now I think it’s the best thing I’ve ever done.’          Paul Edwards, right, got down on one knee on Christmas Eve in departures at Gatwick Airport to propose with Sarah Elliott, who he had only \u0027met\u0027 on the dating app Bumble nine days earlierAs for Sarah, she is convinced their marriage will last the distance and is looking forward to telling their future children the remarkable story of their courtship — or rather, lack of it.For even the new Mr and Mrs Edwards, now the most famous newlyweds in Britain following widespread publicity, admit the word ‘whirlwind’ barely does justice to their relationship.After what they describe as ‘hundreds’ of hours of phone conversations in less than a fortnight, they decided to skip the dating stage and tie the knot, despite never having met.Sarah wasn’t even sure what her intended husband looked like because when they Skyped he was sitting in a poorly lit room, but was relieved to discover he was ‘very handsome’ in the flesh.          Paul handed Sarah and antique £800 engagement ring before they boarded their flight ‘Paul suggested I look at his Facebook page to check him out but I didn’t want to do that. Anyway, too much emphasis is placed on looks,’ she says.Their decision to wed appears to have been based instead on gut instinct, blind faith, trust and what Sarah describes as ‘a deep connection’, plus a shared history of past relationship traumas.Sarah, who has one failed marriage behind her and still lives with an ex-partner in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, says: ‘I can’t remember who brought it up, but one of us said, “We get on so well — maybe we should get married”.’Paul, a father of teenage girls aged 15 and 13 who lives in Chichester, West Sussex, says: ‘I think the whole idea came about because I asked her what she was doing for Christmas and I said, “How about we have our first date on Christmas Day?”‘Then I had another lightbulb moment and suggested, “How about we go on holiday for our first date? Life’s too short.”‘The subject of marriage came up and Sarah said, “I’ve always thought about going on that programme where couples get married at first sight.” I laughed and said, “Let’s get married, then”.’Thankfully, after that first meeting the ten-hour transatlantic flight served only to cement their determination to marry, and they arrived at 2.30pm local time to prepare for the evening wedding.Even minister Roland August, who starred as Elvis in the Katy Perry music video Waking Up In Vegas, found it all stranger than fiction, telling me: ‘They are the first couple I have ever married on their first date.‘It’s quite unusual, even in Vegas! But Sarah and Paul seem made for each other and I wish them all the best in life.’Indeed, the new Mr and Mrs Edwards do seem likeable, down-to-earth, intelligent and considerate characters who both sound terribly sincere about making this marriage work.          Sarah, pictured, picked up a designer wedding dress in the internet for £100But are they in love?There is a slightly awkward ‘whatever love means’ moment, reminiscent of Prince Charles’s reply when he was asked the same question at a press conference announcing his engagement to Lady Diana Spencer.‘There was a definite spark when we first met at the airport,’ says Sarah, choosing her words carefully. ‘What is important to us is the commitment, from which love will develop and grow. We’ve both had relationships where we did it the normal way round and it didn’t work out, so why not do it this way instead? In many ways it feels more traditional, choosing to commit based on shared values, interests and morals rather than just physical attraction.’Paul adds: ‘We are not in love yet. We’re still getting to know each other — that will come with time. But yes, we do fancy each other, which helps.‘Our wedding night wasn’t awkward because we’d talked about it at length beforehand, sharing with each other what we liked and disliked, so there would be no misunderstandings. We both have a high sex drive.’Rather than viewing their union as a madcap adventure, the couple prefer to compare it to wartime marriages, which often had the briefest of courtships but, based on solid, realistic foundations, stood the test of time.Their families, however, took some convincing.Sarah, who moved to Britain from New Zealand when she was 18, says: ‘My parents were very shocked and urged me to wait, saying, “Why don’t you just go on holiday instead?”          The pair had been corresponding online for only nine days before first meeting ‘They insisted on speaking to Paul on the phone, and after 30 minutes they felt much more reassured. I’m looking forward to introducing my husband to my family and friends — if I have any friends left after this, because most of them have disowned me.’Likewise, Paul’s father advised caution, especially as Paul was still recovering from a broken heart after his girlfriend of eight years broke off their engagement in February, just four weeks before their planned £20,000 country house wedding.‘I was very upset,’ says Paul, ‘but I’m grateful to my ex-fiancee now because if she was unhappy with me our marriage wouldn’t have lasted.‘I can see there wasn’t enough balance in my life, I sometimes worked 80-hour weeks and put my relationship second. But I was ready to commit to one person for ever and although I was disappointed that relationship broke down, it didn’t change that core belief.’Sarah, who had a happy childhood in Wellington, New Zealand, says she always longed to emulate her adoptive parents by having a long, happy and stable marriage, though the ideal has so far eluded her.Moving to Britain, where she worked as an estate agent before becoming a nanny, she says she fell into an abusive relationship before meeting her first husband, a dry-stone waller, when she was in her early 20s.They dated for more than four years before agreeing to marry, their blessing witnessed by Sarah’s family in New Zealand in 2012. Just six months later, however, the marriage was over.‘My first husband was very kind and gentle but we were more like best friends than husband and wife. I think I only married him because I felt my parents expected us to,’ she says.  The couple pictured meeting in public for the first time at Gatwick Airport (left) and with their luggage as they prepare to board a flight to Las VeasShortly after their wedding, Sarah also discovered she was infertile and says: ‘I felt very guilty that Nick might never be able to have children with me and I might have prevented him marrying someone who could.‘After we split up, he went on to meet someone else and have a family, and he’s happy now, so I feel it was the right decision to end the marriage.’Moving from the North of England to Kent, Sarah next had a long-term relationship with an electrician that lasted for three-a-half years. After splitting up, they decided to carry on living together until the house could be sold — but in the meantime Sarah threw herself into internet dating, which proved soul-destroying.‘You’d go for a date and never hear from the guy again, or he’d treat you with no respect,’ she says. ‘I felt I deserved better, so I decided to give up and only saw Paul’s message when I logged on one last time to close my account.‘From the moment we first spoke, there was a connection I’d never felt before.‘We could be completely honest with each other about our histories. There was a mutual respect.’Raised by his father after his parents split up when he was two, Paul told Sarah about his ‘misspent youth’, which led to him leaving home at 16 and ending up homeless at 17, living on the streets for six months.Taken in by a church, he was helped back on his feet and worked as a nightclub lighting technician before moving into broadcasting.          Mrs Edwards sits down for a drink after meeting her soon to be husband at Gatwick Airport          The couple, seen here chatting before they boarded the plane, say they couldn\u0027t be better suited to one anotherHis first daughter was born when he was 21, but his relationship broke up and he had a second daughter by a subsequent relationship which also didn’t last.His daughters live with their mothers but Paul says he sees them regularly and took them out for lunch separately to break the news that he was marrying a woman he’d never met. Both accepted the news with a maturity beyond their years.‘My elder daughter — when she’d stopped laughing — said it was cool. My younger daughter didn’t laugh but was also supportive,’ says Paul.Sarah is looking forward to meeting them and hopes that, with the help of IVF, she and Paul will one day add to the family, once they have sorted out where they are going to live as a couple.Five days into their marriage, Paul proudly reports that they haven’t had a single row yet and are filled with optimism for the future, even though Sarah has already told her new husband to ditch his Next suits because her ex used to favour them.‘So far I have absolutely no regrets. More people should do it,’ he says, before adding: ‘But ask me again in a year.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Model Twiggy Python star Michael Palin honoured New Years list","story":"Twiggy, pictured left in 1966 and right in 2016, becomes a dame in the Queen\u0027s New Year Honours List for her services to fashion, the arts and charityIdentities of 44 BBC reporters working in Russia are leaked...Krokodil and the flesh-rotting horror of the drug that EATS...Share this articleActor and comedian Michael Palin, pictured in 2014, is honoured in the New Year\u0027s listThe award, included among 93 announced by the Foreign Office in the Diplomatic Service and Overseas New Year Honours List, is for his services to travel, culture and geography following his successful second career as a travel writer and television presenter.

On a wider scale, this suggests radical change in institutions and large organisations. The personal meaning is clear, too. The conjunction will give steely determination to all who seek change, and this will become more intense as 2019 progresses.The year ahead also brings an event that will be visible across the world, as Mercury, planet of communication, trade and commerce, traces a path across the face of the Sun in November.

Just think about how the world has altered since then. Fires, floods, famines and fake news. Trump, Brexit, you name it — all the things we thought we could depend on have been thrown up in the air, and unparalleled and unimaginable change has affected all our lives.But the build-up to this year’s transit brings the potential for more honest communication and a sense of relief, as hidden agendas become clearer and new bonds of trust are nurtured.The Supermoon Lunar Eclipse in January, which sees the Moon turn red, gets us off to a flying start. It is one of many optimistic cosmic signs this year, and helps focus our intentions. With the right kind of motivation, this can be the moment when the intense period of upheaval we’ve been experiencing finally begins to ease.Then, as the doors to better communication gradually open, we can expect positive (if surprising) developments concerning difficult and isive issues, such as referendums, elections and breakdowns in trust.Jupiter, the planet of luck, adventure and boundless optimism, will be at full strength in its home sign of Sagittarius for almost all of 2019. That means we’re in for an adventure, too. Advances can be made on the most difficult of journeys, and there’s fun to be had.Along with this surge of optimism comes a quest for meaning and purpose.

This signifies momentum and the chance to form hopeful new allegiances. Even those in conflict may find themselves on a similar track.But when Uranus returns to Taurus early in March, we can expect some shocks to the system. We might welcome the resulting innovation, but it will also remind us that security and stability can be necessary casualties on the road to genuine progress.The antidote for tumult lies with Saturn and Neptune’s long-awaited and encouraging alliance, which peaks three times in 2019.While taskmaster Saturn’s disciplined nature seems at odds with Neptune’s free-spirited, expressive style, these strange bedfellows encourage the best in each other. Saturn’s determined realism helps to cement Neptune’s dreams, ensuring that inspiring ideas become more than just wishful thinking.With their final tryst coinciding with the Transit of Mercury, the journey of 2019 will end optimistically.

I have something called anosmia – it means I can just about recognise the taste of salt, sugar, and spice. But not much more. I’ve read a lot of articles about it, and am yet to find one about how great being “anosmic” is. Why is no one talking about how amazing it is to find yourself unable to smell your own shit? In the first few weeks I’d bring the tissue I’d just wiped my arse with right up to my nose, and it would blow my mind: no scent!I can’t smell anybody else’s shit either. I’ve lost the ability to judge your shit, if you forget to flush all I can do is observe it like an art piece. They say when you lose a sense, others are heightened whether that’s true or just for superheroes – being left unable to decide what a thing “smells like” has forced a much more intimate relationship with what I see, and hear. This has bled into every aspect of my life: relationships, food, and yes, politics. In this bizarre, opaque, untrustworthy political climate I voted remain, and I didn’t vote for Theresa May – I didn’t get what I wanted – so I’m exploring more carefully what we have. Now I watch our politicians, study them each an art piece unto themselves, what set of words have they chosen? When did they pause, stutter, where they speed up or slow down, what’s going on with their eyeballs? Are they breathing steadily?I was in Black Earth Rising, written by Hugo Blick, this year. The character I played, Kate Ashby, is forced to reconsider ideas of identity and belonging through the course of the series. It led me to do the same in my personal life. Timely, given all the “go home” rhetoric that’s been around. I had to hold that up to my nose and sniff. I know it’s shit – but is there anything good that can come from it?As long as I can remember, responding “London” to the question, “where are you from?” has never been enough. People want to know where I’m “from, from”. It goes like this: “From?” “London.”It’s a question both Blick and myself (in my sitcom Chewing Gum) poke at. A chuckle-worthy query, rather than offensive. I feel very welcome in my home, London. Sure, there’s been trauma, but bless all of us on the council block: we were often terrorised as kids by our grandparents’ view of the world, whether white British, or immigrants. The things said and done in childhood ignorance aren’t reflective of who we are as thinking adults so many are friends now. But I also have many friends and feel incredibly welcome in that other home Ghana.I get a lot of taxis, and I’ve shared this thought with the amazing drivers I’ve met. I’m reassured, advised against confusion that “go home” isn’t directed at people like me. I understand, but when England has been prophesying another place I must be “from, from” for 30 years, the prophecy starts to fulfil itself. For me, that’s no bad thing, but just like my response to anosmia, this is not a representative experience. It’s just mine. Others find themselves in Britain to escape daily threats to their survival. I read that traits of a “great” character include responsibility, humility and empathy. If we’re to call ourselves “great” as a country I’m wondering if we should make sure these are traits we abide by and express to the world.I started off as a cleaner in Lloyds Bank, Northern Rock and Lakeside Foodcourt before making television. As a child of migrants, Britain has been “great” to me, the opportunities I’ve sought and received here have allowed me to consider going home more easily than many others. And so I began, as of a few weeks ago, planning to build a sustainable zero-carbon footprint home in Ghana. Something that won’t abuse the soil otherwise I’d just be another thoughtless westerner imposing myself in Africa with no ethics or morals in mind. London will always be my home and now I’ll become more acquainted with my other home.It won’t stop the questions – I’m asked where I’m from in Ghana too. This feeling of straddling two homes is one that first-generation immigrants strongly identify with of being both, and yet none. It isn’t necessarily a bad feeling, it’s simply a feeling. I love this country, I’ll always be a Londoner. But aren’t I lucky enough to have two lovely, prospering, beautiful homes, full of great people? I’m grateful for my life here, for all I learn here, so why not start taking to Ghana, to share, work and learn there?I was in its capital only last month, when Prince Charles visited for his birthday. I watched my prince and my president, Nana Akufo-Addo, dancing to Ghanaian music. Both homes dancing together. Witnessing such visual unity made being “Brit-ish” not such a big identity crisis after all on second thoughts, I’m privileged enough to have seen a selfish silver lining in the “go home” vans, in the constant question of my origins. I think about my other home, and my dad: I miss him, and now I’m going to do a whole lot about it.• Michaela Coel is an actor, screenwriter and producer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b79eae04c20cb073702c0dafacf25deda2ef5d5b/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f2b6569049b3619e79c7e5d50a3a9e","title":"parliament brexit second referendum eu deal","story":"Parliament is deadlocked. The Brexit tin can that has been kicked down the road since June 2016 is now lodged firmly in the machinery of Westminster, bringing parliament to a grinding halt. MPs cannot now agree on how we might get parliament and government working again.The prime minister has delivered a plan for Brexit that she feels is the best our country can achieve, given the government’s red lines. I have no doubt that she is sincere in this. But this doesn’t create a majority in the House of Commons for it. Quite the opposite: any rational examination exposes the deal’s flaws when compared with either the reality of the status quo or how far short it falls of the leave campaign promises in 2016.The Labour position is even more questionable. When the opposition front bench is able to agree on what it wants, it usually focuses on wishing to retain customs union access, with a voice at the table in Brussels – both unacceptable to our European neighbours, and not in practice possible legally.I believe that it is important, now more than ever, that members of parliament engage in rational arguments, not in reiterating undeliverable wishlists. Thankfully, roads have opened that could lead us out of this Brexit crisis. One obvious solution, which is fast gaining support, is to hand the issue back to the country. I would add that we also need formally to take no deal Brexit off the table, because that way lies chaos and disaster.Both of these would help to calm a crisis that is only set to grow, unless parliament can assert itself and decide on a way forward. Work is being done by all sides to understand how we might find our way through the current crisis, and the campaign group Best for Britain has set out four ways to secure a people’s vote in its recent publication Roads Not Yet Explored: Routes to a Final Say, to which I have contributed a foreword.Brexiteers tell us (and hope) there simply isn’t time to have another referendum before article 50 expires at the end of March 2019. But this is simply not the case. The EU will give us the time if we want it. So long as there is political will to deliver a solution to the current impasse, there is a course of action available to us that means we will be able to check whether or not the will of the people has changed over time. To call this a subversion of democracy is utterly wrong. We will not be thanked by anyone for dragging the country out of the EU on a deal for which the public have shown no enthusiasm. For MPs that would be an abdication of responsibility.Parliament voted for the public to decide the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union. We should now ask the people whether the prime minister’s deal satisfies their hopes and demands, and if it does not, offer a viable alternative. Our country needs a rational outcome and, judging from the current situation, parliament is not capable of delivering it. We need to open the road for the people to finish, one way or another, the task they started in June 2016.

The pub there was crammed with walkers as soaked as ourselves, who boasted they had never been so wet in all their lives. The rain made us comrades, turning the pub into an idealisation of English decency, so that when we walked onwards to the station at Glynde – the rain now subsiding – we felt in good spirits, which lasted until we reached home through the suburban dusk and learned that Gavin Stamp, a good friend, had died the day before.Gavin would like Firle, so I’d thought on the train, guessing that he probably knew it already. He knew something about most places, and it was always worth getting in touch with him before travelling anywhere to see what he could tell you. Mainly it was buildings – he was the country’s pre-eminent architectural historian – though his knowledge and opinions never stopped at stone and brick. Many years of writing the Nooks and Corners column in Private Eye gave him a sound knowledge of local politics, and of local corruption, through his campaigns to save good architecture from the wrecker’s ball. He believed that Britain’s postwar destruction of its Victorian heritage amounted to a form of national self-hatred.Whenever I was in a church in 2018 I thought of his feeling for them. “Oh, I love churches,” he said after I complained I’d been taken to see too many of them in Lincolnshire. I have never been a believer, but the more churches vanish as a functioning part of the British landscape, the more valuable they seem as rare agents of thoughtfulness over profit. Other than public libraries, few institutions now stand so apart from commerce. One of them begins my list of 10 good memories from a year in which private escape from the public realm became ever more attractive.David Hockney’s new window at Westminster Abbey has been celebrated for its vibrant colours and lack of religious symbolism. It shows a red country path, blue skies and the white hawthorn blossom of the Yorkshire Wolds, without a saint or cross in sight. But this isn’t a new departure from ecclesiastical tradition. In late summer in Cumbria, just over the border from Hockney’s native county, I visited a disused and neglected church with beautiful windows that depict nothing but the northern landscape. St Gregory’s near Sedbergh – the “railway church” – was erected in the 1860s to serve a congregation that originally included the navvies who were building the line through the Lune valley. The windows came later, the work of the stained glass designer Frederick George Smith circa 1900. They are worth seeing.Wemyss Bay has one of Britain’s most handsome stations, built to serve the trains and steamers that connected Glasgow to the Firth of Clyde’s islands and resorts. A few years ago, a local support group opened a gallery-bookshop in one of its several empty offices. There’s always something tempting in stock. I’ve bought Ruskin there, and Douglas Bader. No station, possibly anywhere in the world, has a more intellectually rewarding place to wait.What a childish thing a step-counter is. Each of its little white lights represents 2,500 paces when all four of them are lit, a green light blinks to say you’ve achieved 10,000 paces. Childish – and yet how much you yearn for the approval of that little green light, leaving the house late at night to take several turns around the block and several more around the kitchen until the target has been reached. After many weeks, an incredible message announces that you have now walked the length of Italy.One of the many reasons the step-counter exists. Those from Helmi’s, the patisserie opened on the island of Bute this year by a Syrian refugee family, are the most delicious I’ve tasted. One of the owners was trained in Damascus in the French tradition of pastry making. The many branches of Patisserie Valerie offer no competition.After nearly 50 years in the city, I’m pleased that there are still millions of people I shall never meet – many of them people who live in much the same way as I do, with similar incomes and tastes. I can go to any of the cultural temples – the British Film Institute, the English National Opera, the theatre (West End and otherwise), the Wigmore Hall – and never expect to see anyone I know. I’m not sure why I find this pleasing, but I think it may have something to do with an idea of strength in depth that, though you might think of yourself as a music-lover, you are surrounded by people who know more than you do. The same with London places: I’m still discovering new and interesting scenery only a couple of miles from home. This year’s haul included All Saints church in Margaret Street, in stunning brick neo-Gothic, and the semi-wild spaces of the Walthamstow wetlands.The debate on the EU withdrawal bill produced several good speeches, including a particularly eloquent one by Caroline Lucas. What was the point? The Commons chamber was nearly empty speeches are no longer much reported in newspapers only a devotee of BBC Parliament would see them on TV. Yet however pointless, that MPs bothered to make them was heartening.This summer’s sun and heat brought out the best in the coasts of Britain and Ireland. On holiday in County Cork, we swam to a cavern in a sandy cove that might have been built to design by Enid Blyton.Helen Parr’s Our Boys deserved more attention. Its central thread was the story of how the author’s uncle, a paratrooper, died in the Falklands war but it ranged far beyond those specifics to produce a profound and often moving study of military behaviour and the military’s role in British life.With its suggestion of falseness, “charming” tends now to be a pejorative. It’s a hard word to avoid, however, in any description of the documentary Faces Places (Visages Villages), directed jointly by the French director Agnes Varda and the French photographer who goes under the pseudonym JR.

They act as buffers to storms and sea level rise and provide habitat for many species, including migratory birds and fish nurseries.Nicholas Murray, the study’s lead author and a senior research fellow at the centre for ecosystem science at the University of New South Wales, said because tidal flats were often at least partially covered by water they had been difficult to monitor in the past.“This is a big ecosystem,” he said. “It’s all over the planet and highly susceptible to threats but we haven’t known where they are, which has limited the ability to monitor them.”The research team worked with Google and used its computing resources to analyse every satellite image ever collected of the world’s coastlines.They found that tidal flats, as an ecosystem, were as extensive globally as mangroves and that coastal development and sea level rise, in particular, were causing their decline.In parts of China and western Europe, they found tidal flats that were up to 18km wide. In Australia, they occur all over the country, including places such as Moreton Bay in Queensland and along the Gulf of Carpentaria.Murray said airports, aquaculture and other infrastructure that had been built on top of tidal flats in countries such as China were major threats. Reduced sediment flows from rivers around the world had also led to a reduced amount of sediment being deposited as tidal flats.Murray said dams were one of the major drivers of reduced sediment flows from rivers. He said further analysis would be needed of the ongoing impact of the other key threat – sea level rise.“This study has really given the data to start making those links,” he said. “It means you can really start to understand the impact of sea level rise and coastal development.”The researchers suggest the study could be used to advance protected areas for tidal flats, which have not always been as well-protected historically because they fall between land and sea.The map is publicly available and Murray said it had laid the fundamentals for an ongoing monitoring system.“The easiest way to think about this is, for decades we’ve been able to observe deforestation,” he said. “We can now do that for tidal flat ecosystems.“We can identify places where tidal flat ecosystems are being lost and the main drivers of those losses, which will allow us to respond with conservation action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0615a171e3d89411fc0fcdf5538c7f05119de747/133_736_1745_1047/master/1745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb3509347c63cc0c33248f53562527c4","title":"party party ten of the best dresses for a new years eve do","story":"Whether you’re going out, going out out or just watching fireworks on the telly, New Year’s Eve is the perfect excuse to get dressed up Prices correct at time of publication"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/173c22d9644ca33a59296166b92a29f7e19a2cfa/0_452_4184_2510/master/4184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b77efc86c6c135066dedc505d40e4971","title":"keira knightley i cant act flirt or mother to get voice heard","story":"The star of Colette on Harvey Weinstein, Disney princesses and why her visceral essay about childbirth and the Duchess of Cambridge hit a nerveWhen Keira Knightley was small there were two things she knew she would become. First, an actor. That worked out. She got an agent at six was in Star Wars at 13 and Pirates of the Caribbean at 17 won an Oscar nomination for Pride and Prejudice at 20 and another, 10 years later, for The Imitation Game. Second, a man. That’s still a work in progress.“I remember everything about that feeling,” she says, now 33, folded up on a sofa in a London hotel. A big blue frock juts out from under her like a nest. “That girls grew into men, and that’s what I was going to be.” Toddler logic, she admits goodness knows what boys became. “Maybe it was that the girls were the most powerful in the playground. They were in charge and, obviously, the men were in charge outside. So clearly that’s where I was going. Only, of course it wasn’t.”Knightley scrunches her face: a chipmunk photobombing a supermodel. Still, she was a grade-A tomboy: no skirts, leading a protest at school until girls were allowed to play football. At 11, she was “obsessed by The Godfather. I wanted to be Al Pacino and that’s where I was heading. The great parts are the guys’ parts. You don’t want to be the pretty girl in the corner or the mum being lovable and supportive. Of course, when you grow up you are, but you still want to have the adventures.”Knightley’s entire career, from ball-busting breakthrough in Bend it Like Beckham to cross-dressing, trans-romancing Colette in her new film, has been an attempt to have adventures her younger self would respect. To explore if not what it would be like to be a man, then certainly “the masculine side of the female, stuck in the dresses and makeup. Almost every character I’ve played has tried to break out of that image of femininity. That’s why I like period films, because it’s such an overt cage you put the woman in. That’s always something I’ve really identified with. I feel like I sit somewhere else.”I look quizzical. “I’ve never wanted a penis,” she clarifies. “Apart from to piss up a tree. Being able to do that standing up: so convenient. You can just whip it out and whatever. But the idea of something so vulnerable swinging between my legs, I think I’m all right without.”Generally, it can be tricky encouraging stars away from unpacking art to chatting genitals. With Knightley, it’s like turning on a tap. I don’t think I’ve ever met someone simultaneously so famous and so garrulous (she’s also bracingly sweary). Or perhaps it’s something only those who have been A-listers more than half their life already can get away with.A few days after we meet, Knightley appears on Ellen DeGeneres’s chatshow to promote The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, and mentions she has banned her young daughter, Edie (with husband James Righton, frontman of the new-rave band Klaxons), from watching the Disney classics Cinderella and A Little Mermaid because of their dodgy feminist messages. Twitter entered white-heat mode. Thinkpieces were spewed out like ticker tape. Presumably Disney – which also made The Nutcracker, which has since flopped – weren’t thrilled. But when asked about it again a fortnight later, instead of calming the waters, she went in with a whisk: doubling down on her argument with some PhD-level Disney princess knowledge.Still, she says in December when we speak again on the phone, being up for a fight doesn’t mean you want a punch. “I thought I was just being perky in an interview. My God, people feel really strongly. Don’t fuck with Cinderella. Her fans will end you.”Anyway, back to Colette. It’s the latest film from Wash Westmoreland, who made Still Alice with his husband, Richard Glatzer, before the latter died of ALS (also known as motor neurone disease) a fortnight after Julianne Moore’s Oscar win for lead actress. They co-wrote this one, too, and it’s clearly the work of a couple: intimate, barbed and funny. The plot revolves around Colette and her literary entrepreneur husband Willy (Dominic West), who pass off her novels as his, until Colette starts resenting the fiction, and Willy’s hypocritical jealousy over her affairs with a Louisiana heiress (Poldark’s Eleanor Tomlinson) and a gender-fluid aristocrat (Denise Gough) who never removes her suit. By and large, men fare badly. But Willy is, like Colette, finely drawn, charming for all his ludicrosity. In one scene, he wins his wife back by explaining that men are the weaker sex, slaves to their biology, ergo his endless shagging.“The Weaker Sex” is also the withering title of an essay Knightley wrote for a collection called Feminists Don’t Wear Pink And Other Lies, published in October. At the time, it caused a stink for what some perceived as an attack on the Duchess of Cambridge for looking glam hours after the birth of her daughter. Was she surprised? “The whole essay was about the silencing of women’s experience. So it’s interesting that’s exactly what happened from certain media outlets. They turned a moment of empathy from one body to another around to say: she’s shaming her.”Yet women seemed just as mean as men. “Yeah, that’s interesting. Internalised misogyny? I’m not criticising that. All of us respond to and survive within the culture in the way that we can. But I think we need to have a big look at ourselves.”Indeed. The duchess section is actually the blandest part of a blazing manifesto that starts with Knightley’s vagina splitting, swiftly brings in blood, poo, cracked nipples and incontinence pads, then closes with a broadside against male colleagues:“They tell me what it is to be a woman. Be nice, be supportive, be pretty but not too pretty, be thin but not too thin, be sexy but not too sexy, be successful but not too successful. … But I don’t want to flirt and mother them, flirt and mother, flirt and mother. I don’t want to flirt with you because I don’t want to fuck you, and I don’t want to mother you because I am not your mother. … I just want to work, mate. Is that OK? Talk and be heard, be talked to and listen. Male ego. Stop getting in the way.”The essay, says Knightley, was “just sort of vomited out”, submitted in a “fuck it” moment, published “because we have to harness this moment in time and use our voices to keep the conversation going. Because we’re saddled with a system built on inequality,” she says, “progress is going to be slow and painful and uncomfortable. But I want to make sure I’m not raising my daughter in fear of the whole other half of the human race. Just as it’s important to raise boys seeing the whole of a woman’s experience, not simply one aspect of femininity. Otherwise, how can you respect it?”The core problem, she reckons, is that the voices of a generation of women are lost to childcare. This means – to bring it back to straying Willy – that “we all empathise with men hugely because, culturally, their experience is so explored. We know so many aspects of even male sexuality. But we don’t feel like men can say: ‘Yes, I understand what you’re talking about because I’ve got this wealth of art and film and theatre and TV from your point of view.’”So if women don’t come on flirty or maternal, she thinks, some men get stumped. “Before motherhood, you’re sexy, but if we talk about the whole vagina-splitting thing then that’s terrifying there’s no sex there, so what we do is go into the virgin-mother retrofit, that’s nice and safe. The problem with those two images is I think very few women actually identify with them. Women are meant to play the flirt or the mother in order to get their voice heard. I can’t. It makes me feel sick.””On set, she was informed by a male director – not Westmoreland – exactly what she was: not passive-aggressive, but openly aggressive. Her eyes pop recalling the shock. “I thought that was extraordinary. I hadn’t raised my voice, I hadn’t sworn, I simply disagreed with a point. And this was someone I liked.”Look back over Knightley’s previous press and what sticks out – more, even, than her habit of irritating people by dint of crimes including her looks and niceness – is her composure. She has always seemed poised, someone of conviction and confidence, if not arrogance. Bumblings have been low-key she has kept it together.Not without effort, it turns out. Earlier this year, she told the Hollywood Reporter that she had had a breakdown aged 22, following five years of endless exposure. She didn’t leave the house for three months. A therapist said she was her first client who wasn’t being paranoid when she worried about people following her. She needed hypnotherapy to feel able to walk the Baftas red carpet for Atonement in 2007.The other reason Knightley speaks her mind is it would never occur to her not to. The perception is that she hails from high privilege. But her schooling was bog-standard her parents – playwright Sharman Macdonald and actor Will Knightley – thespy, but also relatively radical leftwing types. Not quite hippies, says Knightley, but as close as Teddington in south-west London probably got. She says she hadn’t realised how lucky she was to be raised by a father who loved the fact his wife often earned more than he did.In the film she is currently shooting, Misbehaviour, she plays Sally Alexander, a women’s libber among those who invaded the stage at Miss World 1970 with football rattles and flour bombs. Watch footage of the real Alexander today and you could be watching an older Knightley. These are her people: arty but determined, polite but forthright.And that, perhaps, is why Knightley’s pronouncements don’t – for me at least – stick in the throat. So much political rhetoric trotted out by film stars smacks of the bandwagon: rote homilies, recited without too much consideration.Knightley sings from a more sophisticated hymn sheet. Take Miss World. Plainly, she’s not a fan: “I’d never seen a beauty competition before but you think, wow this is really out there! The way they turn their arses and the cameras panning up and down. The way society as a whole goes: ‘Oh no, this is fine.’”But while the actions of Alexander et al were “amazingly brave”, she’s not sure she would have done the same, because the contestants felt they were being attacked. “That was unfair. And having been on stage, if something like that happened it would be utterly terrifying.”She is even measured when I asked about Harvey Weinstein, giving “credit where credit’s due he was very good at getting independent cinema an audience”. They had most contact around the time of The Imitation Game, when she wasn’t remotely in need of patronage, and pregnant – both reasons he didn’t try it on, she thinks. “And maybe he just didn’t fancy me, could be as simple as that.”She swears ignorance over his alleged assaults. “I absolutely knew he was a womaniser, because you could see it. But I thought that was consensual, and I’d never heard he’d raped anybody. Everyone knew he was a bully because he would scream and shout. But it wasn’t obvious he was doing what he was doing with the bathrobe and the massage and the pot plant. The pot plant!”Such as? “About their sexuality, how they see us, exactly what they want. It’s a really tricky discussion but I don’t know how we move forward without engaging men. And you can’t hate them if you’re trying to do that.” A pause, another grimace: scepticism made flesh. “Also: they’re nice. I know some really lovely ones.”• Colette is released on 12 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58594002856a74e767d5f720f01bc113217dac3a/0_130_4530_2718/master/4530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae14dc03e9e937606f33794d8f5e58ef","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool arsenal oxlade chamberlain","story":"• ‘We’re doing better than we expected but no one is celebrating’• Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain training and could return this seasonJürgen Klopp has just had the best Christmas imaginable. Not only are Liverpool six points clear at the top of the Premier League but Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is back in training. Yet, despite everything looking sunny at the halfway point of the season, the manager insists his side can improve.“I don’t think we have been seen at our very best yet,” Klopp said before Saturday’s visit of Arsenal. “We have had very good moments but overall we have not been as spectacular as we were at times last season. We don’t concede as often but people ask what has happened to the free-flowing football. It’s like a kid getting a nice present for Christmas then asking where’s the other one. You can’t always have everything sometimes it is best to be grateful for what you’ve got.“People will always want more but we had to develop from last season, to step aside a little and start again. We had to score a lot of goals last season because we conceded so many but we have worked on our defending since and I am pleased with the result.“I loved the way we played against PSG and Napoli, for example. Faced with strong opponents we still went for them. You cannot play like that against everybody – when we came to play Manchester City we had to be careful not to give anything away in case they hit us on the counter – but sometimes a team comes along, like Chelsea, and you know that both sides are going to go for it. That’s brilliant, I love games like that.”Pep Guardiola has just suggested Liverpool will begin to feel more pressure now they are out in front but Klopp feels it is still too early in the season for mind games and league tables. “I have to say 51 points at the halfway stage is better than we expected but no one is celebrating yet,” the Liverpool manager said. “The players are mature enough to know that. The time to get excited over a six-point lead is when there are only four or five games left to play.“I didn’t feel any different when I came in from the last game and someone told me the City result, and I certainly didn’t when I heard the Tottenham score. It is important to consider who is in the bunch of teams around you. We are in a good position but it’s silly to talk about points gained and lost when you have Arsenal next followed by City.”Klopp’s caution is understandable, though in each of the past three seasons he has seen the eventual champions emerge early and build up an unassailable lead. “That is true but those champions never had City at their back or a Tottenham side growing stronger every year,” he said. “When I came to England Harry Kane was 21 or 22, Dele Alli was just a kid from the lower leagues. It was a completely different situation to the one at present.”Even though City have lost three of their past four league matches and Tottenham have still to come to Anfield Klopp refuses to acknowledge that the title is Liverpool’s to lose – a footballing cliche he greets with a slight grimace – insisting instead that the best way for his side to keep up their unbeaten record is to keep concentrating on the next match.“We are not the hunters who have turned into the hunted. We are just a football team trying to play the best season of our lives,” he said. “Although actually that was the plan last season as well. We have brought in some fantastic players and created an atmosphere here where we believe in our own ability. We can handle difficult situations. We learn and go again.“I know some of his players very well indeed, particularly Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. He is an outstanding player and a proper goalscorer who can do a lot of damage. He has a pretty rare combination of speed and finishing skill, and on top of that he’s good at heading. It all adds up to a pretty nice package.”But the prospect of meeting up with a former Borussia Dortmund player does not animate Klopp as much as the anticipated return of Oxlade-Chamberlain. The Liverpool manager was distraught when the midfielder damaged knee ligaments in last season’s Champions League semi-final and, though prepared to be without him for the whole of this season, is now being told the player could be ready in February or March.“That would be the best, best news,” Klopp said. “He started back and from the first step he took it looked completely normal. Right away it looked like Ox and that was really nice. Then we had to wait for the reaction – and there was no reaction, which is even nicer.“I don’t want to pre-empt the medical department but we now have hope he will be back this season. It actually looks like he could play tomorrow, though of course we will not be doing that. There is a long way to go but it looks good. It is a boost for the whole dressing room because Ox is such an important part of that and it’s great to have him around with a smile on his face.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf80839432ad36ce1e6fadbbfcc4098b319c0be2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae4dcdd3324d97da2b8102639e606fe7","title":"pierre emerick aubamayeng","story":"The Arsenal striker has a claim to be the most thrillingly old-fashioned centre-forward in the Premier LeagueOK, but apart from that. Apart from scoring more goals in the last three and a half seasons than anyone else we have seen in England. Apart from being the Premier League top scorer in a new-build team still trying to work out their rhythm and shape. And apart from doing all this with a thrillingly controlled range of movement, that easy grace that scarcely leaves a dent in the dew. Apart from all that. What has Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang actually done to commend himself as the deadliest, most thrillingly old-school centre-forward in the Premier League?It is normal to have reservations about Aubameyang. People often do. As Arsenal have begun to stutter a little, with Saturday’s trip to Anfield looking like a chance to measure the distance this team still has left to run, there will be a temptation to question everything.Perhaps Aubameyang could have put away an even greater percentage of his chances. Perhaps he could mask the clanks and clunks of the new era a little more effectively, pulling out that fun, goofy grin more often, the look of a man who celebrates every single goal he scores as though this is the greatest, most unexpected thing that has ever happened to him, as though he simply had no idea such things were even possible.Either way Aubameyang is likely to enter the new year as the league’s top scorer. And as ever there is a vague sense of surprise about this. It isn’t hard to see why he confuses people. Football is a crowded, structurally baroque thing, a mess of noise and duelling metrics, tangled headphone chords, yellowing cheese board remnants, triple-screening evenings on the sofa arguing about expected goals with a parody Jeremy Corbyn Twitter account.In the middle of which there is a clarity to watching a player like Aubameyang. His outline is distinct. At a time of postmodern positional fudge, Aubameyang remains a pure cutting edge. No one in any major European league has more goals from fewer shots. No player has made fewer interceptions and scored more goals.It is a minimalism that can be both devastating and amusingly peripheral. Against Chelsea in August Aubameyang played for 90 minutes and touched the ball 18 times. Three months later in the win against Spurs he produced the most ruthlessly destructive inidual performance of the season, with 44 touches, two goals, an assist, five tackles, nothing wasted, nothing thrown away.He even won two headers, this from a man who still grins manically when he successfully heads the ball, and who is even now – whisper it – on a run of three whole games without committing a foul, being flagged offside or making a tackle.This is nothing new. There is some YouTube footage out there of Aubameyang’s first goal against an English team in the colours of Milan at the one-off World Youth Championships in Malaysia in 2007. Even this is pure one-touch killer, a run off the back of the Arsenal defence and a dreamy one-touch no-look instep volley yawned over the keeper with a flex of the big toe, not breaking stride, just running off to laugh about how good he is.Milan still didn’t sign him. To date the only teams to have spent any money on this wonderfully smooth goalscoring machine are St Étienne, Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund, who got rid of him in part because their own measures suggested he was doing less, moving less, carrying out the team plan to a less exacting degree.This is a part of the Aubameyang paradox. He is both a modern footballing athlete and a throwback to pre-Premier League times. In the age of 4-4-2 there were two main types of centre forward. First the classical Big Man, present now most obviously in the shape of Andy Carroll, who in his better moments can still replicate the destructive effects of hurling an aggressively confused wild yak from a second floor balcony into a Christmas market shopping street. And secondly the fast, smooth, LinekerAubameyang type, who made good runs and finished well and played right at the front of the team.A cutting edge this sharp is still supremely effective. Aubameyang has nine Premier League away goals in 2018. His goals in tight games have been responsible for 12 league points so far this season. Plenty of Arsenal fans prefer the more aggressively involved Alexandre Lacazette. Others have twigged that Mesut Özil, ine imperial princeling of the late Wenger years, cannot really play in the same team. One minimalist is fine. Two looks like decadence.Plus, the game has not changed that much. Perhaps the main thing that has gone wrong with Manchester City in the last month is just that their own killer up front has been injured or out of form. For all the talk of opponents wising up to the high press, of the loss of Fernandinho’s rapid transitions, these narratives are often engineered out of some fairly arbitrary details, games won or lost by fine margins. Stick Aubameyang in that City team for the last four games and they would probably end up winning all of them, albeit in a way that reflects little additional glory on the evolution of third-season Pep-ball.That slightly aloof style does not really fit any obvious philosophy or pattern of play. But it is still foolish to overlook the most obvious route to goal, or the power of the minimalist, who might not be the best or the most complete, but who has a particular kind of beauty in his cold clear lines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c25bb419f90ff6f23e07c380204577984d0ce2/2_0_8723_5236/master/8723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d9bf7db63ab782f125d4f4377f6ffe","title":"bolognese and bonding why i love cooking with my children","story":"With smart appliances like the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, getting your kids to help out in the kitchen is easier than ever. Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

Here are your stories and picturesAfter a classic London renting situation, where my partner and I had to live with a leak just above the bed for a month, we finally got the savings together to get a shoebox of our own. No leaks yet, thankfully. It was on the first or second day, while we were eating on the floor over a sheet (with a bit of wine in tumblers), and were laughing and looking out of the window, surrounded by an endless pile of boxes and bags, that I felt a sense of calm I had never experienced before.Lying on my swing seat in my garden, the sun shining and a gentle breeze through the leaves of the birch tree above me. My swing seat was the best purchase I ever made: I’m on holiday whenever I sit on it. Whatever my mood, it answers to it, whether I’m happy or sad, elated or exhausted, with friends or on my own, for breakfast, dinner, lunch or tea. It is the best thing.In the middle of a small barn, in May 2012 at the end of 48 hours of lambing, while sitting on a low hay bale the only human in a barn full of sheep. I am no farmer, and in that barn I was no more than a nursery maid. Sheep mums being mums and lambs being lambs. The nursery had a rhythm: when the skipping and eating stopped, there was a calm that absorbed me. At that moment, life was good, and I was a part of it. I was one of the flock.Social media has some great benefits, but it can easily become mentally and emotionally burdensome. So, when we went to Havana in Cuba we made the decision to stay in a casa particular, essentially a private home, that had no access to the internet, a phone signal or any of the other trappings of modern life. For two days, in a small farming town called Viñales, we truly switched off. In the months since, I have deleted my Facebook account, closed email accounts and use my phone only for keeping in contact with close family and friends.In the minute after my second daughter’s head had crowned. The midwives were chatting, laughing and taking care of everything. It would soon be just me and my baby, in a secluded newborn ward, where I could just breathe and see the changing light through the window. No criticisms, no complaints, no office politics, no prioritising other people’s moods, no factoring in bills to pay, no existing for others. Only this most real thing that we were still doing together. This was the start of our conversation, the one that will continue all our lives.Sitting on Pentire Head, near Polzeath, north Cornwall, on a sunny October day in 2013. Tucked out of the wind, feeling the sun on my face and listening to the waves crashing against the cliffs below. The sea was almost turquoise and I felt a moment of complete calm all was well with the world.In July 2016, I tagged along for a day on my friend Ralph’s fishing boat, hauling lobster and crab pots for him around the Eastern Isles of the Isles of Scilly. The best bit was halfway through the day, when we were sitting there on the water in the sun, a mile out to sea, eating our cheese and pickle sandwiches, drinking a flask of tea, and lobbing the crusts and the odd bit of crab bait to curious fulmars that had joined us. Marvellous.An afternoon in hospital in Montélimar in 2009, after having had all four wisdom teeth removed. They had been growing horizontally and should have come out when I was a teen. One day, at 40 years old, with my first ever real toothache, I was told by a dentist that they had to come out straight away. I was waking up from the anaesthetic and staring out of the window at the intense blue sky, watching huge clouds of steam floating up from the nearby nuclear power station. I am self-employed with two children, and moments like that are incredibly rare. For once, I was without a care in the world.I had been having relationship difficulties for some years, and one day snuck away to visit my daughter at university. It was the first time in a long time that I felt free. I didn’t have to watch what I said or did, as I knew my daughter loved me unconditionally. Every minute was precious: we talked, laughed, ate out, shopped and hugged. That day was my first taste of what our life could be if I had the courage to leave, which eventually I did.My first ever wild swim as an adult was September 2012 in a tarn in North Yorkshire, hunting for a friend’s lost mobile phone. However, I didn’t embrace the joys of intentional outdoor swimming until October 2017, and I’ve been addicted ever since. The impact of the water meant I could think of nothing else but what was happening to my body: the numbing of the fingers, the sense of needing to gulp air but attempting to slow myself down to regulate my breathing. The sense of foreboding that I woke up with that morning has gradually faded, and has been replaced with a sense of wonder at immersing myself in the elements.September 2016, lying on a sunlounger at night on the terrace of a hotel on a hill outside Fiskardo, Cephalonia, with my husband, Richard. Every night, we would sit there and look at the beautiful sky, with no light pollution, and watch the shooting stars. We did this for an hour, chatting or sometimes just staying silent. Sadly, Richard died suddenly from a heart attack the following April. Perhaps understandably, I haven’t felt as relaxed since as I did on that holiday.It was a bright, clear day in September in a sleepy part of northern France, and I had stopped with my family at a lake. The water was gloriously cold, and I felt alive. Treading water, I turned to look at my family on the empty beach, waving and laughing at me, and I felt absolute contentment at being somewhere so beautiful with the people I love most in the world. The sunlight created an almost perfect reflection of the surrounding arc of trees and I realised that I was miraculously happy.Being off-grid with no phone, no people, no food, books or noise (other than the occasional breeze and a few flies) in Rub’ al-Khali – AKA the Empty Quarter – one of the most beautiful, harsh and huge deserts in the world. Every year, I get dropped off deep in the desert and stay alone for three days, with enough water and shade to survive, and without any expectations on me or my time. There is no experience like it that has this level of silence and peace.Walking the Camino de Santiago in September to mark the end of four years of study. Two girlfriends and I walked the Camino Inglés, and the freedom from anything else other than the walk each day was incredibly liberating. Every morning, we convened at 8am, had breakfast and set off, walking steadily to our destination, pausing occasionally to take in different sights and appreciate the landscape as it unfolded before us. The feeling of release from our cares was amazing, and we are already planning our next walk, along the Portuguese coastal path.I recently started an oil-painting course. The first week was landscapes, and I spent three chilly hours in a field painting the view. It was the most relaxed and carefree I had felt in a long, long time. My painting was pretty dreadful, but it didn’t matter: I had tried something new and felt proud of myself.In October, I went on a school trip to the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. After a long day of studying, my friends and I were free for the night and went swimming together. Maybe it was the lack of adult supervision, the scent of the sea or the general comfort I had from being with my friends that made me feel so relaxed. We were as free as a bunch of 16-year-olds on a school trip could be, which isn’t much, but at least I felt as if I could do what I wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/849178a2d92b866c56e0d6e7520894aef7457807/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ea3f191a60d1bab840f8e8947a946d5","title":"blind date emma kyren","story":"Emma, 40, comedy performer and MC, meets Kyren, 42, payroll accountantWhat were you hoping for?A fun and interesting evening with someone easy to chat to.First impressions?Really lovely smile, kind eyes and a kind face.What did you talk about?Travel, food, art and being freelance.

You sit on a soft, comfy chair and put on a pair of headphones. You’re in the world, yet not in the world: the one I went to was in a shared working space, so heels clacked past and people talked about coffee. They’re soon to open a meditation-only space in central London which, on paper, sounds more calming. Yet even here, the ambient clickety-clack of other people’s lives recedes like birdsong once you’re semi-reclined and plugged in to the iPod they provide. I don’t know what your resting stress-level is I was as relaxed as a sun-basking dog in five seconds flat. It was all I could do not to go to sleep.Inhere’s co-founder Adiba Osmani reminded me that meditation used to be about the quest for deep existential truths: the inner peace it fostered was a side-effect that took off, like the discovery of Post-it notes by scientists who were trying to create the world’s strongest glue. The soundtracks, or certainly the one I chose – designed to give you strength for the mountainous challenge of the day ahead – are focused squarely on your interior life.This will sound bad: I can’t remember exactly what was said. You can’t take notes. That would be the least mindful thing ever. I’m not ruling out the possibility that I went to sleep without realising, but I prefer to think that a sense of peace washed over me so completely that my executive function took a break. Notions floated in and out – root your feet to the ground feel the power of your connectedness rising through you. Concentrate on breathing. It’s such an unfamiliar feeling when you properly do that: it makes me wonder what I’m doing to get air into myself the rest of the time.“Before you even think about the words,” Osmani told me, “just consider how rare it is to take 20 minutes out.” Stepping out of the world is its own reward. For some reason, sitting in a cafe doesn’t cut it.I chose a 20-minute session – you can do between 10 and 40 – because I was worried I’d be bored. It is categorically not boring all the old saws about meditation – you need to do it a lot in a disciplined way before you can lose yourself in it – are not quite right, though there is a transcendental state beyond “half asleep” that I haven’t reached yet. Still, even for a frenetic novice, the difference is alarming. For the rest of the day, that whirring, ticker-tape mental activity – remembering to do things, getting distracted by a fly – seemed to slow down to something much calmer, more methodical. I cannot put my finger on anything more I achieved, no great challenges met, but I seemed more centred, focused.The only thing I couldn’t say for sure is whether or not you’d get the same effect at home, sitting quietly in a comfortable spot, filling your lungs to their unfamiliar limits with purest air, rather than in a special seat. But when did you last have the time and (head) space? Was it even this century?If you meditate a lot, according to a University of California study, you will find it easier to concentrate, even on repetitive and boring tasks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12286c4a0e1b8a123bbb9fefdfb8ce6f6fdd7df1/0_404_1023_613/master/1023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d24a85d9b24d7a40d3e39422f72cd983","title":"how we live together the housemates with a 71 year age gap","story":"After spending my first year of university living in student halls, I couldn’t cope with the prospect again.

Not likely. An argument with a squirrel – that I can write about.Memory and perception can be famously poor mediators of reality. In this dark era of disinformation and fake news, I find it helpful to take stock of my life on an annual basis, reckoning with nothing but cold, hard numbers. These, then, are my personal statistics for the year 2018, using the very latest obtainable figures.6 Number of columns over the course of 12 months that I have written about having a bad car. I am truly sorry about this. I never set out to try the patience of readers by revisiting the subject so relentlessly, but then I had never previously understood the myriad ways in which a single secondhand automobile can be bad.7 The approximate numbers of ways, in my newfound understanding, in which a car can be bad: the badness of having warning lights that come on for no reason the badness of leaking oil the badness of being a model recalled by the manufacturer because of a tendency to suddenly lose all power while driving at high speeds and of also being recalled for sometimes catching fire while standing still of having a key part installed the wrong way round of having a gearbox that periodically overheats and of being officially listed – erroneously, as it happens – as stolen by a prominent credit reporting agency.1 Scraps of paper on which I felt obliged to write a quotation from my wife, to be signed, dated and held in my wallet for safekeeping, in order to remind her of her previous attitude to our car problems at a point later in the saga. The exact quotation was, “Come on – it’s funny!”365 Number of mornings I have told the cat to shut up after it woke me by yowling in my face in order to get me to go downstairs and turn the kitchen tap to a trickle, because that’s the only way the stupid cat will consume water these days.365 Times I have relented and gone down to turn on the kitchen tap immediately afterwards.5 The approximate total number of squirrels that I now actually believe constitute the previously supposed single squirrel I consider to be my arch-enemy, and one of which is staring at me through the window with hate in his eyes as I write this.36 Miles per hour I was travelling, in a 30mph zone – ironically, in a car so troubled it would give out for good the very next afternoon – thereby obliging me to attend my first ever speed awareness course in Dorset.3 The number of times, in 2018, I have reinstalled the same bathroom shelf that is even now leaning so badly that anything you place on it slides off and crashes to the floor. I figure I can get one more ineffective repair out of it before the year is out.11 Number of swearwords I immediately deleted from my prepared remarks to the Ealing Civic Society’s annual building design awards as soon as I laid eyes on the audience.9 The approximate number of decent laughs I nevertheless managed to wring from that same Ealing audience, thereby rendering the evening insufficiently disastrous to appear in the subsequent week’s column.66 Percentage of those successfully landed jokes that were at the expense of Acton.43 Instances per annum of a fox crossing the large garden of a house 100 metres away, thereby interrupting a sensor beam and triggering a security light so powerful that it creates a window-shaped beacon against my bedroom ceiling bright enough to wake me up, affording me a few quiet lonely hours to ponder the meaninglessness of existence, the certainty of death and, at some indefinable point in the future, the possibility of curtains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3caafd3316341e2e6a08b7bf24c166e148c86cec/82_0_4414_2650/master/4414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4217817a277dd7cc9c9a3b72f15c984f","title":"your money in 2019 what to look out for in the year ahead","story":"Uncertainty over Brexit dominates the landscape – but there will be more predictable changes, such as rail fare risesWe will soon be waving goodbye to a turbulent 2018 and saying hello to a 2019 that – because of the ongoing Brexit chaos – will also be swathed in uncertainty. The UK is due to leave the European Union in about 90 days’ time, but will Brexit actually happen, or will it be delayed or even halted? How the year pans out will inevitably have a huge impact on the money in our pockets.Here are some of the key dates over the next year:• 1 January The government’s energy price cap takes effect. This has been set at £1,137 a year for a typical dual-fuel customer who pays by direct debit. The energy regulator, Ofgem, says 11 million consumers will get a fairer deal and typical customers on the most expensive tariffs will save £120 a year.• 2 January The National Rail 26-30 Railcard goes on sale. More than 4 million people will be eligible for the card, which will give up to a third off the price of leisure journeys across Britain for £30 a year. A minimum fare of £12 applies to all journeys made before 10am Monday to Friday. You can buy the railcard up to and including the day before your 31st birthday and keep using it until its expiry date.• 31 January It’s that time of year again: the deadline for filing your self-assessment tax return online for the tax year ending 5 April 2018 (and for paying any tax owed). Remember that you will be hit with a penalty of £100 if your tax return is up to three months late. You will have to pay more if it is later than that, or if you are late paying your tax bill. You will also be charged interest on late payments. • 29 March Brexit day. If we crash out, it could be the most shocking day of the year financially, with forecasts of the pound tumbling, house prices tanking, the stock market shrivelling and inflation taking off. But, hey, we do get a new 50p coin to “commemorate” the UK leaving the EU. This is due to be issued by the Royal Mint in the spring. The “Brexit coin” – as it was dubbed by the Treasury – will bear the words “Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations”. It will also carry the date “29 March 2019”. But will 50p still be worth 50p once we’ve left the bloc? Answers on a postcard ...• By the end of March It will be easier to have a flutter when the minimum investment for premium bonds is cut from £100 to £25. Bondholders will also be able to set up standing orders to buy a minimum of £25 to save on a regular basis (currently the minimum is £50).• 1 April Good news for many workers: the national living wage – which was introduced in April 2016 – will increase from £7.83 to £8.21 an hour. This is the statutory national minimum wage (established in 1999) for those aged 25 and over. For 21 to 24-year-olds, the minimum wage is £7.38 and will rise to £7.70. The rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will rise from £5.90 to £6.15, while the rate for 16 to 17-year-olds will rise from £4.20 to £4.35.• 5 April The last day of the 2018-19 tax year. “If you haven’t taken advantage of this year’s Isa, junior Isa, lifetime Isa or annual pension allowance, this is your last opportunity to do so in the 2018-19 tax year,” says the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown.• 6 April Those receiving the full old basic state pension will get a weekly boost of £3.25 a week, with their payment rising from £125.95 to £129.20. Meanwhile, the full new state pension – for those retiring from April 2016 onwards – will rise from £164.35 to £168.60 a week.• 6 April The lifetime allowance for pension savings will increase in line with CPI inflation, rising from £1,030,000 to £1,055,000.• 1 May There is bad news if you are one of the 500,000-plus people who hold National Savings \u0026amp Investments index-linked savings certificates. From this date those people will see their returns linked to the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation, rather than the retail prices index (RPI). This is notable because CPI is generally lower than RPI. The change will be applied to all maturing certificates where the holder chooses to renew into a new certificate. Index-linked savings certificates haven’t been on sale since 2011, but existing holders are able to renew them when they mature. NS\u0026ampI says the move is forecast to result in a total saving to the taxpayer of £610m over the next five years. That’s a pretty big gain and would appear to suggest that on average, each certificate holder is set to lose out on a total of £1,200 of interest as a result of the change, assuming everyone renewed on to a five-year term.• 29 August The final deadline for complaining about mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI). So, in the words of the animatronic head of Arnold Schwarzenegger (which featured in a major advertising campaign aimed at raising awareness), if you haven’t put your complaint in yet, “make a decision, do it now!”• 29 November Black Friday. Another opportunity for us to buy more stuff we don’t really need.• 30 November Help-to-buy Isas won’t be available to new savers after this date. “However, if you already have one, you can keep the account open and carry on paying into it for another decade, and you have until 1 December 2030 to claim your government bonus,” says Laura Suter at the investment firm AJ Bell. With this Isa, which is for first-time buyers, for every £200 you save, the government will contribute £50. You can earn a maximum of £3,000 from the government this way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b32d46184c6864a843780af235c81b4db563ee31/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aae9e6392b8ea23f54f06677385a39c0","title":"2019 in pop culture from adeles 30 to zapping your tv","story":"A guide to everything you’ll need to know about TV, film and music next year, including Tarantino’s Charles Manson obsession and what’s next for Richard Madden’s bumby  Leonie Cooper,  Michael Cragg,  Hannah J Davies,  Harriet Gibsone,  Joel Golby,  Ellen E Jones,  Steve Rose and  Jack Seale“Have you been heartbroken again, lately, Adele?” the label bosses said to me, and I had to sing mournfully back to them: “No–ooh–oh, ooh–oh–ooh–oh.” I’ve been happily loved up since 2011, haven’t I? Big massive son in 2012. Married to my long-term partner in 2016. Mainly just drink tea and that now. I paid for Alan Carr’s wedding essentially out of boredom. “You can’t sing about Alan Carr’s wedding,” they said. Which is bollocks because planning that was actually very fraught and we had to have at least two big barneys about the table settings and four (four!) about whether we’d have bows on the chairs, so actually, Sony, there is a lot of material there. They still said no.I go home. Start thinking about things that wind me up. “Lower back pain” is one, even after we got that special mattress. Or “When Simon and I start a new box set but he watches three episodes ahead then just goes on his phone when I’m watching with him” – which ruined Mad Men for us both. “Should I give up  Or should I just keep setting tables.” The coffee machine we have at home makes nice coffee, but not as nice as an actual coffee machine, in an actual shop. Is that one? Write it down anyway. Picking up Lego? Write it down. Go on Facebook and look at everyone I sort of half-fancied at school to see if they’ve lost their hair or had kids yet (they have). Boring being 30, isn’t it? Not much drama to it. Simon’s not washed the casserole dish yet when he said he’d clean the casserole dish. “And I throw dish soap  In the sink  Watch it pour as I  Touch your fa–ce.” Gonna start an argument with him when he gets back, see if there’s anything in that. Make him sleep on a sofa for a couple of days and see if that inspires anything. JGThe new James Bond movie is already exhausting and they haven’t started making it yet. So far, it has been a succession of cliffhangers: will Daniel Craig return, or slash his wrists like he promised after Spectre? (He’s back on board, for now.) Will Danny Boyle direct? (No, but here’s Cary Joji Fukunaga to replace him). Will Bond die at the end? (Highly unlikely, but that’s what Boyle wanted.) The rumour mill always grinds long with Bond movies, and the fact that this one’s release is set for February 2020 means we have a whole year of speculation to look forward to. One thing we can be (reasonably) sure of: this will be Craig’s final mission as 007. Which means we’ve got the bonus game of “who’ll be the next Bond?” to add to the fun. It’s anybody’s guess. Recent candidates include Richard “Bodyguard” Madden, Dev Patel, Paapa Essiedu and Harry Styles. Who else? Brooklyn Beckham? Millie Bobby Brown? Jacob Rees-Mogg? SR“Soooo is this, like, for grownups? Or little kids?” That is the question confused people in cinema foyers will be asking throughout 2019, as the trend for subversive remakes of animation classics continues. After the reimagined Mary Poppins, we can look forward to a gothic, Tim Burton-directed Dumbo (the trailer reveals definite shades of Lynch’s The Elephant Man) a new Aladdin, in which Will Smith bravely takes on Robin Williams’ iconic Genie role a “punky” reboot of 101 Dalmatians called Cruella, set to be directed by I, Tonya’s Craig Gillespie with Emma Stone in the lead role and a hipster Lady and the Tramp featuring Tessa Thompson, Janelle Monáe and a screenplay by “mumblecore” legend Andrew Bujalski.The Disney highlight, however, will be a new live-actionCGI, Black Panther-referencing version of The Lion King, which has already being called “the blackest Disney film ever”. The cast features Chiwetel Ejiofor, James Earl Jones (reprising his Musafa role) and Seth Rogen and is headed up by a dream team of Donald “This Is America” Glover as Simba and Beyoncé as Nala. There is no word yet on whether Glover will also contribute any music in his Childish Gambino guise, but Queen Bey is already down to collaborate with original composer Elton John on some new soundtrack material. EEJCharles Dickens’s semi-autobiographical tale never looked like a vehicle for creative swearing and quick-fire political farce, but in Armando Iannucci’s hands, who knows? Especially since Peter Capaldi is on board (as Mr Micawber). It’s a story oft-told on screen, but the man behind Veep and The Thick of It has said he wants his version to feel “current and contemporary”, with a cast more representative of modern London than the 1840s. Hence the surprise casting of Dev Patel as the first non-white Copperfield in movie history. From Mumbai slumdog to Victorian workhouse, Patel has come a short way, you could say, but Iannucci “couldn’t think of anyone more appropriate”. The ensemble includes trusted names such as Ben Whishaw, Paul Whitehouse, Hugh Laurie, Benedict Wong and Tilda Swinton (as Betsey Trotwood). Much as he did with his comedy The Death of Stalin, Iannucci promises to brush the cobwebs off costume drama. SRFuture TV-ologists will date the end of the Geekassic Period to 2019, when the small screen’s apex predators finally went extinct. The Big Bang Theory and Game of Thrones might seem like two entirely different shows – one’s a sexless sitcom about weedy Caltech physicists the other is a bonk-a-thon, fantasy drama with dragons – but these huge hits represent just how thoroughly nerd culture has gone mainstream.Both shows will air their finales in the coming months, which is not to say the nerds will be instantly banished back to their basements. As well as all 338 (combined) episodes being available on demand for all eternity, there are several sequels, prequels and spin-offs in the works. Young Sheldon is already on a second season, while HBO has commissioned work on five possible GoT “successor shows”, including one co-written by George RR Martin and Kingsman’s Jane Goldman. EEJThe degree of praise heaped on the Fleabag star and creator since the show first came out – Phoebe Waller-Bridge is Generation Snapchat’s Shakespeare! Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the first female to say the word bum, ever! – has been so huge it has almost eclipsed the show itself. So it would be easy to forget where we left the character in season one. To recap, its final scene saw our protagonist hollow from the grief and guilt of the death of her best friend Boo, but being given a second chance by a fragile bank investor interested in saving her guinea pig cafe.So what is next for our tragi-comic hero? Shane Allen, controller of BBC comedy commissioning, has revealed its themes are “very distinct from the first series”. The show has been held up as an emblem of modern feminism, but since it first aired, conversations around gender imbalance have been uprooted and inspected, from the movement towards intersectionality to #MeToo. Will this have an impact on the narrative? Or could Waller-Bridge’s career ascent (this year, she played L3-37 in Solo: A Star Wars Story, and penned and exec-produced Killing Eve) add celebrity force to the sadcom? Or maybe just a cameo from Thandie Newton?Much of the original cast have been confirmed – Olivia Colman is the evil godmother and comic Brett Gelman is the evil Martin – while Sherlock star Andrew Scott has also signed up. We know nothing of his role yet but it’s likely to involve some kind of bleak sexual encounter involving a rusty spoon and an alleyway. Or guinea pigs. Can’t wait. HGAfter a year off to let the cattle roam free and to clear up oh-so-many laughing gas canisters, Glasto returns – but will it be back with a bang or a wheeze? Our money is on the former. So far, Stormzy is the only confirmed headliner, while Kylie has been given the now coveted “legends” slot on Sunday afternoon. Liam Gallagher has already tweeted a not-so-subtle nod to the fact that he will be among the lineup. Bookies’ fave to top the bill is Kendrick Lamar, who would be the first US hip-hop headliner since Kanye West and his wobbly cherry picker in 2015. In other, ahem, rumours we want to believe, it seems as if 2019 will finally be the year that Fleetwood Mac play. Warning: if they do, it will be without Lindsey Buckingham, who parted ways with them earlier this year. Led Zeppelin are also in the mix, as well as Elton John, Madonna and Paul McCartney, who could return 15 years after his 2004 set. We’d be happy with any of the above, but who are we kidding? We’re probably going to spend four days in the Stonebridge Bar trying to get a selfie with Jarvis Cocker and miss everything at the Pyramid stage. LCEvery couple of years, Courtney Love teases a possible Hole reunion, but this time it sounds as if you’ll need to get serious about bringing that diamante tiara out of storage and scrawling the word “slut” across your belly with a tube of Rimmel lippie (shade: Sugar Plum). There was a brief reunion of sorts with bassist Melissa Auf der Maur in October but the real gold is set to come with Love’s autobiography threatened for early 2019 – surely the perfect summer beach read, BTW. Love says she will be working on new music following publication and, after 2012’s one-night, two-song appearance of the classic lineup showed that Love, Auf der Maur, Eric Erlandson and Patty Schemel were on good terms, hopefully the next Hole album will be made by all four, unlike 2009’s essentially solo Nobody’s Daughter. Twenty-five years after Live Through This ripped the seams of pop culture’s fishnets, we are so very ready for more. LCLast year was when Mark Zuckerberg lost our trust for ever, when it transpired that Facebook had sort-of facilitated the rise of global fascism. And while its pumpkin spice latte-guzzling little sister Instagram continues to thrive, the golden age of social media seems done, with even the new iPhone OS boasting “digital detox” features to push you into occasionally engaging with the outside world. Besides, influencers from Zoella to Logan Paul have proved that this new, highly unregulated age of celebrity is not without its controversies, having, respectively, flogged crappy advent calendars and shown a dead body on YouTube. But could we really give up on social media, and will next year be the one when we do it? So much of our cultural output seems to be a reaction to our always-on world, whether that’s Rina Sawayama’s phone-addiction anthems, or Channel 4 reality show The Circle, effectively a Gen Z Big Brother with a Black Mirror edge. Mudhoney (remember them) even released a song in 2018 imagining Jesus’ crucifixion as a social-media broadcast. And, as much as we want to acknowledge its vapidity, what else would we have to moan about if not the ills of technology, as every generation before us has done? (See: Video Killed the Radio Star.) It seems, then, that this uneasy relationship will continue – at least until the microchips-in-brains era anyway. As Jenny*, 24, tells us, she couldn’t delete Facebook anyway (“How would I know when anyone’s birthday was?!”). HJD*Names changed to protect the innocentControl (1986). Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989). Janet (1993). The Velvet Rope (1997). Four consecutive albums that helped shape what pop music was, is and will be in 2019. In fact, Janet Jackson’s influence is so huge and manifold that she has a lengthy Wikipedia page featuring a list of artists influenced by her. This features the obvious (Beyoncé, Britney, Aaliyah) the slightly more outré (Robyn, Dev Hynes, How to Dress Well) and the does-it-even-need-to-be-spelled-out (Eliza Doolittle, Peter Andre, Heidi from Sugababes). If you’re thinking: “Well, yes, but she’s not done much since that whole Super Bowl wardrobe-malfunction thing,” then please be quiet because a) 2015’s fresh-sounding Unbreakable album is a lost classic b) She has been touring a high-energy hits extravaganza in the US for most of 2018 and c) Following August’s Made for Now, there is new material coming to prove that she’s still very much part of today’s musical conversation, thank you very much. MCOver the space of four albums, Lana Del Rey has elegantly inched away from the bruised Hollywood dame caricature she created after Video Games propelled her to stardom in 2011. Her 2017 album, Lust for Life, for example, added more personal touches to her lyrical moodboard of vintage Americana, bad boyfriends and a New Look-sized assortment of red dresses. Perhaps her biggest shift is still to come, with 2019’s excellently titled, Jack Antonoff-produced Norman Fucking Rockwell album, preceded by the country-tinged Mariners Apartment Complex and the distinctly un-radio-friendly, 10-minute-long Venice Bitch (her managers apparently responded with “Can you make a three-minute, normal pop song?” when she first played it to them), a song that reflects the United States’ current mood via its fractured dissonance. She has been more confrontational too, admonishing Kanye and ending an entertaining spat with professional provocateur and part-time rapper Azealia Banks on Twitter with the T-shirt-ready slogan “I won’t not fuck you the fuck up”. Welcome to new Lana. MCTracking the supposed movements of somebody’s rear end is a difficult task, but it’s a task I’m willing to take on, just for you. The bum in question belongs to Richard Madden, former member of Games of Thrones’s Stark clan and most recently the star of the BBC’s hotbed of political intrigue – no, not The Andrew Marr Show – the Jed Mercurio-penned “racy” thriller, Bodyguard. Since he pulled what’s now known as a “Night Manager” and flashed his behind in the acclaimed show, the 32-year-old Scottish actor has become the hottest property in tellyland since Tom Hardy pouted his way through a modelling contest on a 1998 episode of The Big Breakfast. But what next for the tush that tippled the UK? Well, there’s a turn as Elton John’s manager and lover John Reid in the 1970s-set flick Rocketman, but that isn’t out till May. So until then, fans will have to make do with joining the 1.7 million others stalking his Instagram. Most popular is currently a shot from July of Madden, his bottom somewhere out of shot but deffo still attached to his body, wild swimming in Devon. A wry smile flickers across his face. His arse, is, we assume, extremely damp. Ladies and gentlemen, control yourselves. If that wasn’t enough to have you reaching for the smelling salts then this quote should shine a light on why Madden is 2018’s biggest bae: “Between filming, I eat pizza, drink, don’t work out, get fat.” Excuse us while we go and order a Domino’s meat feast. LCHollywood has been like a ghost town recently. Where have all the actors gone? Where’s Brad Pitt? Where’s Leonardo DiCaprio? Where are Al Pacino, James Marsden, Dakota Fanning, Damian Lewis, Emile Hirsch, Kurt Russell? Even Luke Perry goes straight to voicemail. Turns out, they are all over on Quentin Tarantino’s set, recreating the Manson family murders and the decadent, dodgily attired, flower-powered Los Angeles of the late 1960s. Tarantino’s take is a mix of reality and fiction, he’s hinted. Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate, wife of Roman Polanski, who was murdered by Manson’s followers in 1969. DiCaprio and Pitt (in their first time on screen together) play fictional friends – respectively a washed-up TV cowboy and his stunt double – who are, says Tarantino, “struggling to make it in a Hollywood they don’t recognise any more.”Tarantino has described the film as “probably the closest to Pulp Fiction that I have done”, which will be music to fans’ ears, but this could be his biggest challenge yet, in the wake of #MeToo. Tarantino’s obliviousness to the depredations of his longtime producer Harvey Weinstein, his treatment of Uma Thurman during Kill Bill, and his defence of Roman Polanski’s sexual assault: all have taken the shine off that once super-cool Tarantino brand. Let’s see if he can redeem himself by restaging the brutal murder of a pregnant woman. SRCreated back in 1991 and ning radio spoofs, sitcoms, mockumentaries, YouTube shorts, two autobiographies and a (surprisingly not crap) feature film, Alan Partridge is a character with unrelenting comedic stamina. Written by Steve Coogan and the Gibbons brothers, new series This Time With Alan Partridge is set in (and airing on) the BBC. It’s the character’s first time back at the channel since the final episode of Knowing Me Knowing You in 1995, during which Alan accidentally killed a guest using one of Lord Byron’s duelling pistols, leading to him being banished to local radio (in reality, Coogan has made some shorts for Fosters and two one-offs with Sky).This time around, Alan will be presenting a One Show-esque sofa chatshow alongside actor Susannah Fielding, whose character needs a new sidekick after her usual host John has a heart attack. By episode two, John is dead and Partridge begins his journey to “worm his way back in”. And what better timing to revive a character so Little England and hard Brexit, that if you cut him open he’d bleed LBC radio mics and pork pie jelly? The prescience has not escaped Coogan, who told journalists earlier this year that the idea for the plot comes from the media’s drive to represent Leave voters more on air. Alan’s return could well be the one positive thing to come out of Brexit. HGThe big news for season three is that the lads are leaving the state of Georgia and taking their makeover magic on the road. All eight episodes will feature “heroes” (victims?) living in Kansas City, Missouri, a mid-size, midwest city, sometimes known as “the Paris of the Plains”. This nickname, as will soon become clear, has absolutely nothing to do with the inhabitants’ love of couture or innate sense of chic and everything to do with KC’s many “boulevard-style” streets. In other words, the Fab Five still have their work cut out.We predict they’ll rise to the challenge, with more Trump-baiting ersity than ever, plus Antoni offering low-effort tweaks to the local BBQ cuisine, Karamo beating his own record for eliciting tears (five minutes in, max), Tan declaring the French Tuck officially over and Bobby doing all the real work. EEJAfter 2016’s palate-cleansing album Anti, no one really knows where Rihanna might go next. Or if, you know, she is even that interested in the music bit of being a megastar any more. In 2018, she released more socks (with Stance), and makeup (via her record-breaking Fenty line, named alongside Nike and Spotify as one of Time’s “most genius” companies), and acted in the actually-quite-bad Ocean’s 8, which went on to gross $300m worldwide. Needless to say, her fans have been getting antsy, peppering her Instagram with questions about new music, with Rihanna even turning herself into a meme by captioning a picture of her wiping her brow with the words “When your fans keep asking you for new music”. So what can we expect? Well, er, everything, really. Early rumours suggested it would be a double album: one half pop and the other dancehall, with producers attached including R City, Sean Paul collaborator Stephen “Di Genius” McGregor, Skrillex and Boi-1da. Then, in September, EDM producer Alesso let slip that he’d heard from mutual friends that Rihanna was making a dance album, a claim that was semi-supported by Diplo. It’s not clear whether Diplo himself is involved, or if he’s ever actually recovered from Rihanna once describing one of his creations as “a reggae song at an airport”. Maybe there will also be a place for latex-friendly experimentalist Sophie, who was pictured in the studio with Rihanna pre-Anti. Whatever happens, expect the music to continue to be just one part of Robyn Rihanna Fenty’s growing empire. MCASMR. Whisper it. Actually, get a little bit of spit on your tongue and then whisper it again. Then hum lightly in the microphone with your mouth mostly shut, before softly brushing your hair and wiggling some slime about in your hands. Nice! ASMR, or autonomous sensory meridian response to give it its full, tongue-wobbling title, is the name given to those stress-relieving tingles in your head brought on by sounds like the above. And, like mindfulness before it, it’s the latest feelgood trend to sweep the internet, with everyone from Margot Robbie and Selma Hayek to Cardi B giving it a go in 2018. In 2019, it seems the trend is poised to only get bigger. Life With MaK, the teenage US ASMR expert, has more than a million YouTube subscribers, and spawned a glut of memes in recent months. And you know when something has really hit the mainstream when the ad-makers get involved: Paramore’s Hayley Williams used ASMR to promote her vegan hair dye brand and Renault recruited a German ASMR YouTuber for a recent campaign. Expect, then, to see ad and album campaigns with an extra buzz (geddit?), as ASMR definitively replaces meditation as both our go-to relaxation technique and go-to sales ploy. But, if you are using YouTube to unwind, don’t forget to actually sleep and eat your greens, too there is probably only so much that hearing a feather duster sweep a microphone can actually do for you. HJDDepending on who you talk to, Donna Tartt’s 800-page, Pulitzer prize-winner was either a deftly constructed masterpiece, or a hugely overrated and overlong bore. It stands to reason, then, that any film based on The Goldfinch would be at least as controversial. Yet early signs suggest this particular adaptation (due in October), will err on the side of awesome elegance. Firstly, there’s the screenplay penned by Peter Straughan, who did sterling work on the BBC’s Wolf Hall series and the 2011 film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Secondly, there’s direction from John Crowley, the man who turned another contemporary literary classic, Colm Tóibín’s Brooklyn, into a Saoirse Ronan-starring, Oscar-nominated screen success. Thirdly, and most importantly, Nicole Kidman has been cast (alongside Ansel Elgort and Aneurin Barnard) as the frosty but kindly socialite matriarch Mrs Barbour. A role she’s always been ready to play. EEJHow does writer-director Jordan Peele top Get Out? He’s probably been wondering that, too. You have set yourself quite a challenge when your little $4.5m horror makes more than $250m, wins you an Oscar, and becomes part of the language (how did we ever get by without the term “the Sunken Place”?). Peele has not ruled out a Get Out sequel some day in the meantime, a few details of his new movie have emerged. We know that Us involves two couples – one black, one white – whose weekend break goes wrong. The first poster describes it as “a new nightmare”. It stars Elisabeth Moss, Lupita Nyong’o, Winston Duke (Black Panther’s M’Baku) and Duke “grandson of Jack” Nicholson. Peele is going to be busy in 2019. He is also making the black-centric, Jim Crow-era horror miniseries Lovecraft County for HBO, and hosting a rebooted series of The Twilight Zone (is that next door to the Sunken Place?). SRNicki Minaj v cellsNicki Minaj is a beef legend: three years ago she was asking Miley Cyrus “What’s good?”, this year she has somehow started fights with pre-linguistic Kardashian children. Things can only get weirder and younger from there. What next, foetus beef? Sperm beef? Will Nicki Minaj end this year without beefing with, like, Drake’s sperm (“Incredibly whack sperm. Just absolutely sub-standard sperm. Zero bars. No streams.”)? I cannot wait to find out.Mason Ramsey v Bhad BhabieTwo of 2018’s biggest success stories were Mason “yodelling” Ramsey – a child who became famous for yelling in a supermarket – and Bhad Bhabie, a teen who got famous for threatening the audience of a daytime TV show with the casual elan of a juvenile offender holding a flicknife. So it stands to reason that, in 2019, their paths must cross and explode into beef. We can’t quite call how this will play out: a street fight with Bhabie attacking a waving Ramsey from a Macy’s Thanksgiving parade float, or a Grammys duet performance that ends with Ramsey getting a nail extension surgically removed from his head? But it’s definitely going to happen.Liam Gallagher v Noel GallagherThe rumour wafting across Worthy Farm is that Oasis will reform to headline Glastonbury next year, which gives plenty of time for 1) Every lad in Britain who’s ever walked into a bar and shouted “Oi oi!” to get excited and start trying to buy ecstasy for it off the dark web and 2) Liam and Noel to reunite, go for a meal, post a selfie on Liam’s Twitter (“As you were”), fall out about something trivial on the way home (“Oh I see, Lord Muck’s getting an Addison Lee home! Uber’s the only real rock’n’roll dial-a-ride service”), split up, and start a whole five-year news cycle about how they hate each other again. JGWhere’d you go Richard Linklater? The Texan stalwart behind Dazed and Confused and School of Rock has been working steadily since his 2014 best director Oscar nom for Boyhood, but he’s yet to replicate the huge acclaim that greeted that long-gestating passion project. Where’d You Go Bernadette?, an adaptation of Maria Semple’s 2012 comic novel about an award-winning architect-turned-recluse-turned-missing-person, may rectify this. At the very least, it will surely make a star of 13-year-old Emma Nelson. The newcomer was plucked by Linklater from more than 500 auditionees to play Bee, Bernadette’s teenage daughter, who resolves to track down her missing mother, and find out more about the woman who gave her life in the process. Nelson will be sharing screen time with Cate Blanchett in the title role, plus Kristen Wiig, Billy Crudup, Laurence Fishburne and Judy Greer in support. EEJXXXTentacion may have been shot and killed on 18 June of this year, aged 20, but the controversial rapper looks set to be bigger than ever in 2019. Yes, despite being quite, quite dead. (Unless you’re of the school of thought that he’s currently living it up on Maui with Tupac, Elvis and Geoffrey from Rainbow, in which case, none of the following will be a surprise.) His streams quadrupled post-death he posthumously won best new artist at the BET awards and his third album Skins made the top spot of the Billboard charts when it was released a couple of weeks ago. Recorded before his death, it was part of the $10m deal XXX – real name Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy – signed weeks before he died. He has also been busy putting out videos, including Sad!, in which he spookily turns up to his own funeral, and the moody, solitary clip for Moonlight, which finishes with a simple dedication: “Energy never dies. He is amongst us. Long live Jah.” Actually, can someone check every Airbnb in Maui? We’re suspicious now, too. Then there are the host of post-death guest appearances: Don’t Cry, his spot on Lil Wayne’s Tha Carter V and there’s a mooted slot on Kanye West’s forthcoming Yandhi, too. Don’t be shocked if he also shows up on Strictly, doing an entertaining rhumba to the orchestral strains of Get Lucky, with special guest vocals from Jess Glynne in a sequinned tux. LCIt was a busy year for Alanis Morissette, a woman whose 1995 debut proper, Jagged Little Pill, enabled literally millions of teenage wannabe poets to fully, like, emotionally unleash. Firstly, that album was turned into a musical by Oscar winner Diablo Cody (fingers crossed its follow-up, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, gets an Eat Pray Love-style stage makeover, too). Then, as well as cutting off all her hair, she illustrated her own range of self-care greeting cards launched her Conversation With Alanis Morissette podcast (one hot topic: an exploration of “four kinds of destructive narcissistic patterns”) and appeared twice at the 1440 Multiversity (ahem), hosting discussions on Exploring self and Self, and Connection As a Way of Life. (We assume the Navel Gazing Yogic Healing Centre is opening in 2019.) She has also been putting the finishing touches to her book, Perpetual Becoming, “a memoir, Alanis-style” that “interweaves her personal story with hard-won wisdom, philosophy, spirituality, guidance, and often cheeky tips on how to live an authentic life”. Incidentally, Cheeky Tips is also the name of her new holistic nail bar. Probably. MCThere will be new ideas on TV in 2019, but old ones are always safer. Reboot of the year should be Veronica Mars, while the BBC will try to make The War of the Worlds fresh with new versions, and ITV has hired Andrew Davies to finish Jane Austen’s final work, Sanditon. Royalty will still reign, as Olivia Colman debuts her Liz W in The Crown, Jenna Coleman is back in Victoria, and Helen Mirren shimmers through Catherine the Great on Sky. Plenty of fan-pleasing dramas also return: Endeavour, Poldark and – yes! – Line of Duty have new seasons.Streaming will only get more massive, with Amazon staking big on Good Omens, staring David Tennant and Michael Sheen, and Netflix throwing billions at its bid for world domination. Potential hits on the ’Flix are rude Gillian Anderson comedy Sex Education and Henry Cavill-powered fantasy The Witcher. Assuming 2019 will not be a period of global calm, TV must keep up with the chaos. Russell T Davies’s BBC One epic Years \u0026amp Years imagines a future of political upheaval that will compete with whatever real upheaval is happening. The Planet Earth team has made sumptuous Netflix eight-parter Our Planet, with a focus on wildernesses and endangered species – or what’s left of them. And Channel 4 has a real-life drama that might feel super-topical, or sadly quaint, in Brexit: The Uncivil War, about how the referendum was lost. We will be desperate for laughs, so it’s a good job that Catastrophe, Derry Girls and This Country are all back.

The party said in a statement that she should quit as MP for Peterborough.But, writing in the Peterborough , she said constituents should “rest assured” that she would remain their representative fighting injustice in the corridors of power.Under parliamentary rules, Onasanya would lose her seat in the Commons only if she is jailed for 12 months or more at her sentencing, expected next month.In the article – headlined I will continue to fight against injustices – the MP made no mention of her 19 December conviction for lying to police to avoid a speeding charge.Instead, the 35-year-old solicitor provided a recap of her involvement in events at Westminster over the past year, including battles over Brexit, universal credit and austerity, as well as local controversies about working conditions at an Amazon warehouse and the planned closure of a tax office.“It’s an honour to be your voice for change over an incredibly consequential period of British politics,” said Onasanya.And she pledged: “While it has been a successful year fighting back against these injustices, there is still much more to be done, and you can rest assured that I will continue to do so as your representative in the corridors of power.”The paper’s editor, Mark Edwards, said he had been asked why the  was continuing to print Onasanya’s column following her conviction.“While she is still the MP – and therefore the elected representative – we believe it would be wrong to deny our readers the chance to read what she has submitted,” he said.“To censor the column would, in my view, be wrong, and in my experience our readers are quite capable of making their own minds up about the columns submitted by local politicians.”Shortly after her conviction, Onasanya compared her position to that of biblical figures Joseph, Moses and Daniel who “were each found guilty by the courts of their day”.And in a WhatsApp message to Labour colleagues, she added that Jesus “was accused and convicted by the courts of his day and yet this was not his end but rather the beginning of the next chapter in his story”.If she does resign or lose her seat, Labour will face a tough fight to hold on to Peterborough, which it seized from the Tories by a wafer-thin margin of 607 in 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fcacc309dd24b9966a01937c04a1dbd364b6df4/154_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d1ad00e8b1b7776e86f0648c2596d2e","title":"brexit more than 100m spent on extra ferries in case of no deal","story":"Ports in Poole, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Immingham and Felixstowe would be used to ease Dover pressureThe Department for Transport has spent more than £100m on ferries to ease potential problems in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Documents outlining the £107.7m agreements say increased border checks in UK ports after Brexit could “cause delivery of critical goods to be delayed” in the event of no deal.The Liberal Democrats described the move as “complete madness” and said public money was being spent recklessly in a last-minute bid to prepare for a no-deal outcome.DfT has signed contracts with the French firm Brittany Ferries, the Danish company DFDS and the UK’s Seaborne Freight to ease pressure on Dover.Contracts were not put out to tender. The DfT said it was responding to a “situation of extreme urgency” brought about by “unforeseeable events”.DFDS was awarded a contract worth £47.3m, and Seaborne was a £13.8m deal. Brittany Ferries’ contract is worth £46.6m, with the company adding 19 return sailings to three routes between the UK and France.The company’s chief executive, Christophe Mathieu, said: “Our priority is to prepare for a no-deal Brexit and to create additional capacity. By increasing the number of rotations on routes like Le Havre - Portsmouth we will be able to meet the Department for Transport’s Brexit requirement.“We will also work hard to minimise impact on existing Brittany Ferries freight customers and passengers, although there may be some changes to some sailing times, for which we apologise in advance.”A DfT spokesman said: “This significant extra capacity is a small but important element of the Department for Transport’s no-deal Brexit planning.“While remaining committed to working to ensure a deal is reached successfully, the department is helping ensure the rest of government are fully prepared for a range of scenarios, including a particular focus on a potential no-deal and to mitigate the impact of any Brexit outcome on all transport modes.”A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: “It is complete madness to see the government recklessly handing over £100m on preparing British ports for a no-deal scenario.

Khadija “Bunny” Shaw is our third winner following Fabio Pisacane in 2016 and Juan Mata in 2017. There is a warmth and gentle magnetism about Khadija “Bunny” Shaw that is immediate and fills the room, a personality as towering as the nearly 6ft frame that pounded in one goal after another during a breathless year of double duty for Jamaica and the University of Tennessee.She has just finished the last of her final exams when we meet on the school’s sprawling Knoxville campus, where the senior communications major is on track to graduate in the spring and become the first member of her family to earn a degree from an American university. For now, a plane ride home and a well-earned break is afoot.Life, in short, is good for the ’s footballer of the year for 2018, a one-time teenage prodigy turned lethal 21-year-old striker who delivered on her long-held promise in powering the Reggae Girlz into their first Women’s World Cup and the Lady Volunteers to the best season in their history.Born\u0026nbsp31 January 1997 in Spanish Town, JamaicaCareer\u0026nbspMade 35 appearances for the University of Tennessee, scoring 27 goals and setting the all-time school record for goals per game (0.77)International appearances\u0026nbsp11 caps for Jamaica, 9 goals\u0026nbspCareer high\u0026nbspScored three goals in five appearances at the Concacaf Women’s Championship 2018, including the opener in the climactic 2-2 draw with Panama that was settled by a penalty shootout, to help Jamaica become the first ever Caribbean nation to qualify for the Fifa Women’s World CupThe accomplishments on their face are remarkable enough. But the breadth of Shaw’s achievement is nothing short of extraordinary given the unspeakable personal tragedy she has overcome along the way, losing four brothers – three of them to gang-related violence – in a short period of time.Shaw grew up alongside seven brothers and five sisters in Spanish Town, the gritty former Jamaican capital on the western outskirts of Kingston, the youngest child of George, a shoemaker, and Monica, a poultry farmer who raised chickens. She recalls in vivid detail a picture-book upbringing – neighbours playing dominos on the corner, music echoing down the sidewalks, children kicking the ball about in the streets – largely sheltered from the ever-looming threat of gang violence that reached a grim peak during her childhood. Through the good and the bad, Shaw’s parents held the family together.“It s a struggle growing up, to grow up in such an environment and see how they persevered, what motivated them to want to motivate me,” she says. “Literally sometimes I don’t know how they did what they did, but they managed to get it done.”A prominent set of front teeth and a prodigious appetite for carrots inspired Shaw’s brother, Kentardo, to coin her leporine nickname, which she loathed at first until she “grew into it”. She made the three-minute walk from the family house to her primary school with her father every day and enjoyed her classes – especially social studies.After school, Shaw would return home and watch her older brothers kick the ball around in the street in front of the house before they headed to a nearby field for practice. Monica forbade Bunny from joining in, wary of her youngest daughter spending too much time on a sport thought to be too rough for girls. Eventually, Shaw coaxed an introductory lesson from Kentardo, who told her she had to start by juggling the ball. “That was one of the hardest things to do, because you got to learn to keep the ball up,” she recalls. “I would kick it up and then let it bounce and I would count, count, count. And I would try to go to two and I would try to go to three. He was like the more technical you are, the better you are playing on a soccer field, because the less technical you are, there are certain things you can’t do on the soccer field.”Over time Shaw’s mother relented and allowed Bunny to play with the boys in front of the house, where her innate speed, touch and creative flair earned her a measure of notoriety. Word spread around the parish and beyond. Then one day Monica received a phone call from Vin Blaine, the Jamaica Football Federation’s director of football, who wanted to invite the precocious seventh-grader to a national team camp.“That’s when my mum was like: ‘OK! You go play! Go to the soccer field!’” Shaw recalls with a laugh. “That’s when I got more involved because at my school, I was the best player. But then when I went to the camp there were players like me.”From there Shaw’s development accelerated and her ascent was rapid. She played in Jamaica’s under-15, under-17 and under-20 teams at the age of 14, coming up alongside present-day teammates Konya Plummer and Deneisha Blackwood. But it was not until the scholarship offers from American universities began pouring in around 11th grade that Shaw viewed football as a career path.After navigating her options with the head coach of Jamaica’s national team, Shaw gave a verbal commitment to play for the University of Florida but, after missing the date of the SAT college entrance exam, spent two years playing in junior college, where she was spotted and recruited by the Tennessee coach, Brian Pensky. The adjustment to American life was tough at times, not least because she has yet to find a place that makes her beloved jerk chicken like the corner spots back home.“You got to just be in the environment and see for itself,” she says. “I knew America was a big place for me in terms of the capacity. And I know it was pretty from what people would say. And I know it’s just way more organised from back home. Sometimes, there are some things that are unexplainable.”Yet as Shaw came of age and flourished on the pitch in the United States, an unfathomable streak of misfortune took hold of her family in Spanish Town. Gang-related gun violence took the lives of three of her brothers. A fourth was taken in a fatal car accident. Then while attending Eastern Florida State College in 2016, Shaw lost two nephews in quick succession: one to a gunshot, the other when he was electrocuted on a football field.The accumulation of grief rocked the tight-knit family and put Bunny’s indefatigable spirit to the test in previously unthinkable ways. Alone in a foreign land, she considered quitting the sport entirely.“I wanted to go home,” Shaw says. “I didn’t want to play soccer. And it was just hard because you lost four and then you come back again and lose two nephews. It’s just like: ‘What more to come? I want to go home because I didn’t get to say goodbye to them and now they’re gone.’ They say you’re not supposed to ask God why, but sometimes I would be like: ‘Why? Why did this happen?’“I would say it definitely got me stronger. And even though it was a rough time, it helped me. You know, in the moment I wouldn’t have thought that. But now, to see what I’ve accomplished, knowing I’ve lost so much, I would say it definitely helped me. But it was rough. I couldn’t focus in school. I was just thinking about it all. And my mum would constantly call me. I would tell my family I want to come home and they’re like: ‘No, you’ve got to stay! You’ve got to make it better for yourself and better for us! So I was like: ‘All right, take a deep breath.’”“But I’ve learned, because it was hard, that you just got to look past it. You know it happens. Everything happens for a reason. It’s what’s happening now, that’s what I’ve got to focus on.”The uncommon blend of physicality, quickness and vision that sets Shaw apart and elevates her teammates has been on full display since her senior international debut in July before World Cup qualifying. She has answered the call with 11 goals in nine appearances, including the opener in the climactic 2-2 draw with Panama that went to a penalty shootout, where the Reggae Girlz punched their historic World Cup ticket.Shaw also finished with 13 goals in 15 appearances for Tennessee as they reached the last eight of the NCAA tournament for the first time, landing in the year-end top 10 of all three national rankings, another first for them. After graduation and next summer’s World Cup, she plans to pursue a professional career either in the United States or Europe. The sky is the limit and these days, after what she has gone through, there is every reason to smile. But even as her career soars to new heights, family remains the core of her support system – and the lessons passed down from her parents keep her grounded.“Remain humble, stay focused and just do the best you can,” she says. “They’ve been there from day one, even when people said: ‘Oh, soccer is a man’s sport.’ They never said maybe you should change your sport and play netball or volleyball. They’d always be like if that’s your dream, try and see if you can achieve your dream. They’ve been there even when we’ve lost games or didn’t make it to where we wanted to. They’d say OK, the next one. You’ll get it on the next one. So with them, having them behind me, pushing me, encouraging me, motivating me, that’s all I need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa0a71b599437408e745bdb097d14cac440a39fc/338_161_5022_3013/master/5022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=095b6898d420cb55ebd7ec0172b57216","title":"alternative review sport 2018","story":"Leinster Senior League side Ballybrack FC, getting a game called off in November by claiming one of their players, Fernando Nuno La Fuente, had just died in a car crash.

This one, though, he slightly misjudged, launching himself straight into some trees. He broke his jaw, left arm, pelvis and several ribs – 17 fractures in all. He ruptured his spleen and collapsed a lung. He was airlifted to hospital, had two operations and was placed in a medically induced coma. Eleven months later the Canadian was on a podium in Pyeongchang, celebrating bronze in the men’s slopestyle. While McMorris appears not to have grasped one key lesson of his accident – flinging yourself into the air at high speed on an uncertain trajectory near woodland is not wise – the bravery that propelled his comeback was humbling. “I was so close to not being able to snowboard again,” he said. “I wish it hadn’t happened, but now it’s so cool that so many people have reached out and said, ‘You’ve helped me through this part of my life.’ Being able to inspire others is better than any medal.”In the race for gold in the hotly contested field of courageous comebacks from unnecessary self-inflicted near-career-ending injury, it is hard to look past Safaa al-Jumaili, the Iraqi weightlifter whose shirt-ripping celebration upon winning his country’s only gold medal of this year’s Asian Games made him an internet sensation for 10 minutes in August. “I’ve trained so hard for so many years, not just to stand on this podium but also to send a message to my countrymen: we are still strong. We could make life better,” he said, after pipping South Korea’s Jang Yeon-hak – who passed out after hyperventilating during his final lift – in a tense and terrific competition, by the (comparatively) wafer-thin margin of 1kg. “Maybe one day a child watching on TV will tell himself: ‘I want to be like him. I want to stay away from the guns on the street, stay away from the bombs and be an athlete.’” And the cause of that 2015 injury, a horrific fracture which nearly ended his sporting ambitions? “It was my own fault. I kicked a barbell and broke my leg.”This has been another remarkable year for Peace Proscovia. The Ugandan netball player established a reputation as perhaps the world’s most deadly goal shooter, led her team to sixth in the Commonwealth Games, graduated from Loughborough University with a master’s in marketing, was signed by Australia’s Sunshine Coast Lightning and enrolled on a PhD in Australia. Now 29, Proscovia was born in rural Uganda, the oldest of seven children. “Where I come from, when you grow up you are expected to be married,” she said. “The same thing was meant to happen to me, but I had to stand my ground and tell my family that I can do this. I was rejected, but I disobeyed my parents and left home to go to the city.” She has since become a celebrity in her homeland. “Girls are now encouraged to go into sports, rather than live at home and get married,” she said. Proscovia was the first African to play professional netball in England, but evidence that others are following in her footsteps came this week, when Loughborough announced the signing of 21-year-old Ugandan goal shooter Mary Cholhok. “I want to inspire more girls who have not yet discovered who they are and how far their talents can take them,” Cholhok said. “I hope to inspire them like I was inspired by Peace.”The Queen of the South defender was with a friend on holiday in Magaluf when he heard a commotion. “We were just sitting on the balcony having a few drinks and a girl started shouting, ‘There’s a fire, there’s a fire,’” he recalled. “So we’ve sprinted down and kicked in their door.” He and his friend dragged one person clear of danger, before his friend collapsed and Doyle dragged him to safety as well. Video taken from a nearby apartment shows Doyle launching himself into a smoke-billowing, blazing inferno. “It’s not that big a deal,” Doyle said. “As soon as you see something like that you just sober up.” It turned out the fire had been caused by a drunken holidaymaker waking up a sleeping friend by using a lighter and an aerosol to blow-torch his feet, and accidentally setting fire to his mattress. Four people were arrested with the damage estimated at £175,000, while Doyle’s reputation was the only thing to emerge enhanced.Rafael Nadal was at his training centre in Mallorca when freakishly heavy rainfall floods hit the nearby town of Sant Llorenç des Cardassar in October, killing 13 people. “It was terrible,” he said. “Scary, and very sad. I really lived that tragedy from very close.” Given his proximity to the floods, and connection with the town – much of his mother’s family are from Sant Llorenç – a response was inevitable. But Nadal’s was above expectations as he headed to Sant Llorenç himself to assist with the clear-up operation, opening the doors of his training centre as a shelter, and donating £900,000 to victims of the flooding. Mateu Puigròs, the town’s mayor, described the donation as “help from a special person for all of us, who shows his love for our land and his neighbours every day because he is one of us”.“I want to show the world to dream without limits, to be fearless in the eyes of criticism, to aim higher than they thought possible and in doing so to explore their true potential,” said Pita Taufatofua before he became the first person to represent Tonga in both the summer and winter Olympics. In 2016 he spent a few minutes in the taekwondo competition, losing his only fight 16-1 but insisting that “there is more to sport than just winning”, and in South Korea he followed a bare-chested, baby-oiled flag-bearing appearance at the opening ceremony with an unlikely tilt at 15km cross-country glory. It is a heartwarming message, and so were the pictures of Taufatofua, having finished 114th, waiting at the finish line with a few other stragglers to cheer home the last finisher of all, Mexico’s Germán Madrazo. This was, the IOC proclaimed, “a moving moment, and one that captured the Olympic values of sportsmanship, courage and friendship of nations”. The fact is Taufatofua, Madrazo and the other athletes involved in that Korean snowy scene – Ecuador’s Klaus Jungbluth, Portugal’s Kequyen Lam and Colombia’s Sebastián Uprimny – had bent all available rules in qualifying for Pyeongchang, and had secured crucial points in four reduced-length races held in Bogotá in December 2017 simply to assist their Olympian ambitions. The five duly became the last finishers in Pyeongchang. This infuriated some rivals for qualification, but Taufatofua had highlighted the faults in the International Ski Federation’s qualifying procedures (currently under review), showed the world to dream without limits and captured some Olympic values. For all of that, and despite the baby oil business, he deserves admiration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39467996f89584f62a4152844a274166eb70bd94/0_220_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccb5c01133a577c4c54eb82a25b6c950","title":"british army officer sets record for antarctic expedition miles","story":"Captain Lou Rudd becomes just the second person to trek unaided across continent A British army officer has set the record for the most expedition miles covered in Antarctica, after becoming just the second person in history to trek unaided across the frozen continent.The 925-mile mission, along with his previous expeditions to the continent, means that Capt Lou Rudd, 49, surpassed a total of 3,000 miles of human-powered travel in Antarctica.The father of three from Hereford finished the gruelling endurance race in 56 days on Friday, two days after the US explorer Colin O’Brady became the first person in history to cross the continent unaided.Rudd, a motor transport officer based at the Infantry Battle School in Brecon, Wales, said he was delighted to have finished the expedition, which he undertook in memory of close friend and explorer Henry Worsley, who died from exhaustion just 30 miles short of completing the record solo crossing in 2016.He said: “My number one priority and objective was to come out here and ski solo, unsupported and unassisted right across the continent and I’ve done that. That was always the primary objective.“I want to say a huge congratulations to Colin – what an achievement. To be honest it’s a minor miracle that both of us have completed a journey that’s been attempted before, but nobody’s ever managed it and then, lo and behold, in one season two of us attempting it.

But increasingly LGBTQ people are going back home for good Criccieth is a proud sort of place. Locals call this corner of the Llyn peninsula the pearl of Wales, on account of the beach sweeping across to Snowdonia. In one of several tea rooms, the coasters read: “New York, Tokyo, London, Criccieth.” Peter Harlech Jones embodies this spirit. A small, well-presented 71-year-old, he’s been passionate about Criccieth since childhood, having spent school holidays here with relatives. “I was born and raised about 30 miles away in a village called Old Colwyn,” he says. “I had a strict, Presbyterian upbringing. Here, I felt very much at ease and was allowed to be myself. I could smoke. I could be a bit naughty. I grew up just loving this place. It’s glorious.”A retired vet, Harlech Jones now lives about 100 yards from where his father was born and raised the family goes back five generations in Criccieth. But Harlech Jones left 46 years ago, aged 25, because he felt that being gay was not compatible with living in rural north Wales. “I still hadn’t had gay sex,” he says. “I feel very patriotic about being Welsh Welsh is my mother tongue. But I knew I couldn’t stay around here because I’d have to remain in the closet. We’re talking about 1972 – it was still really difficult.”Harlech Jones moved first to Liverpool to study veterinary science, then to London, where in the mid-70s he plucked up the courage to go into the gay bars of Old Brompton Road – but only after he’d walked past them several times.As a young man in Sunday school, he’d quietly tried to pray away his attraction to other boys now, he found his people in the gay Christian movement. He came out to friends and flatmates, met lovers. He slowly began the process of coming out at work. “I was still scared, but I was ready for it,” he tells me, over coffee and Welsh cakes in his living room overlooking the seafront.The broad trajectory of Harlech Jones’s early life will be familiar to most LGBTQ people. Leaving home is a part of our story, a chapter we tell a lot. Comedian Hannah Gadsby nailed it in Nanette, her acclaimed Netflix standup show: “I loved Tasmania. I felt right at home there. But I had to leave as soon as I found out I was a little bit lesbian.”Cities are where gay communities were built: think of 28 Barbary Lane in Armistead Maupin’s Tales Of The City, or Canal Street in Queer As Folk. Rural queer life has been much less visible – and largely unrepresented in queer culture. When these stories do appear – in Annie Proulx’s Brokeback Mountain – they rarely end well. More often, as on Bronski Beat’s classic gay anthem Smalltown Boy, the places we come from are seen as somewhere to run away from.But increasingly the global city is proving less of a safe haven. The number of LGBTQ spaces has diminished dramatically in recent years, under pressure from aggressive property developers, as well as digital apps that make it easy for gay people to connect online. This has meant the loss of vital support networks, given that LGBTQ people experience more mental health problems than the wider population. A 2016 University College London report found that the number of LGBTQ venues in the capital has more than halved since 2006, while San Francisco’s oldest gay bar closed last year.On top of this, high rents and precarious employment are making cities less attractive in general. Last year, the number of people leaving London reached a 10-year high. At the same time, with gay marriage and unprecedented LGBTQ visibility, we live in a broadly more tolerant world. So it is little wonder that many people are reassessing their relationship with their home towns and that some, like Harlech Jones, are even going back for good.Harlech Jones did not want to turn away from Criccieth. But by the 1980s, when he was in his early 30s, he found that he couldn’t bear even to visit. “I used to drive home to see my parents,” he says, “and feel that the sooner I got there, the sooner I could leave.” A gap opened up between his new life and the old. When his father died suddenly from a heart attack in 1985, Harlech Jones realised he’d missed his chance to be honest with him. He became depressed. A counsellor suggested he confront the burning issue: when was he going to come out at home?This was 1980s Britain, the time of section 28, the Thatcher government’s ban on the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities. The Aids epidemic loomed, bringing in its wake a climate of fear and shame. When Harlech Jones came out to his mother in 1987, she thought he was going to tell her he was HIV positive. He wasn’t, but being gay was stigma enough. “She said I mustn’t tell anyone around here,” Harlech Jones says. “She was ashamed of me. So I felt then I could never come back.”But a change in Harlech Jones’s romantic circumstances transformed his relationship to home. He met fellow Welshman Mike Bowen through a mutual friend in 1996, but it wasn’t until they were both single and living two blocks from each other in east London in 2001 that they got together. Bowen moved into Harlech Jones’s flat within three weeks.By this time, Harlech Jones’s mother was in her 90s her health was deteriorating and he knew there was little time to mend their differences. He introduced Bowen to her that year. His mother was apprehensive but, endearingly, had done her homework. She knew Bowen liked football, so chatted to him about Match Of The Day. At the end of the encounter, they embraced. “It was quite emotional,” Harlech Jones says. “That last period of my mum’s life was wonderful. We resolved a lot of the angst.”At her funeral in 2003, Harlech Jones read the reflection to a packed chapel. “I said that one of the happiest moments for me was taking Mike to meet her, and that he was there as my partner at her departing. So the whole town then knew. And that was very empowering.” The positive experience galvanised Harlech Jones. He and Bowen had talked about buying a second home together gay friends had suggested they join them in the south of France, but Harlech Jones had another idea. He told Bowen: “Let me show you Criccieth.”They bought in the town that same year. Despite the tensions Harlech Jones had felt with home, he had remained a frequent visitor over the years. Now, he cemented links with family and friends, and became active in the local church. This fresh presence led to him being nominated as high sheriff in 2015, even though only full-time residents were eligible to take up the post. It was an opportunity for the couple, who had married in 2013, to settle permanently. Bowen, originally from a small village called Bedlinog near Cardiff, also relished a new start in their homeland.For Harlech Jones, it is emotional to recall all this. The road travelled has been hard, he says. His eyes well up. “It has a spiritual root of considerable depth, being back in this town with the person I love, who is the biggest part of my life now. I can’t believe it has happened.”It has not been such a long road back home for me, though I left Creggan, a tiny village on the Northern Irish border, in 1997 when, like Harlech Jones, it didn’t feel possible to be myself there.The 1990s were a better time to grow up gay. I did not have a physical space to be in, such as a local LGBTQ group, but there was the opportunity to get on what the academic Kelly Baker calls “the gay imaginary” – access to print, film and other media that said something about the life I might hope to live. There was This Life on television and the gay magazine Attitude in the newsagents (if you could reach the top shelf). Remarkably for that time in rural South Armagh, I found a gay best friend I met Jarlath Gregory on the school bus home and we bonded over bands and boys. To a scared, closeted kid like me, my unapologetically queer mate, all eyeliner and attitude, was a lifesaver.We both knew we had to live real gay lives, and that this wasn’t going to happen in Creggan. So we left for college in Dublin, across the border. Although homosexuality had been decriminalised in Ireland only four years earlier, in 1993, the move enabled me to come out and articulate who I was. I had the space to be incredibly naive and romantic, after an adolescence learning about life from Tori Amos records.The academic and writer Bryony White also found self-realisation in the city, having grown up in Weymouth, Dorset. A degree in English at King’s College London offered the gateway to a life her bookish teenage self had always imagined. “London was always where I was going to find my true self and be happy,” she says, laughing. “I thought I’d be walking around like a flaneur, reading Virginia Woolf and having a lovely time.” White, 28, met a woman they dated. Weymouth, meanwhile, drifted into her peripheral vision. For the first two years of college, she kept ties with home. But when she came out in 2011, things became fraught. “I don’t think I really spoke to my dad properly for about a year,” she says. “It came as a massive shock.”It took four years of talking to get to a better place with her family. In that time, White went back for holidays and Christmas. She has written about the experience for the online literary magazine Hazlitt, describing home as “somewhere that I felt was suspicious of me and I was suspicious of it. We were constantly circling each other, withholding things from each other.”Yet in summer 2016, when White’s relationship ended, she decided to go back. Everything in London reminded her of her ex-girlfriend besides, she had a PhD to return to in the autumn, so it was for only a couple of months. Still, she was nervous. Weymouth was a place where White had never been herself: “I felt completely out of context there.” But home had changed since White went away. Weymouth now has an LGBTQ group, which her mother dug out some information about. There was even a gay club, the unfortunately named Closet. And something else about home captured White’s imagination. She discovered that another queer woman, the writer Sylvia Townsend Warner, had lived openly with her partner, Valentine Ackland, in 1930s Dorset – forging a queer space for herself where there was none. White visited the Dorset county museum, where she found photographs and artefacts from Warner’s life. She made a pilgrimage to see the home the couple had made for themselves almost a century earlier. As White writes, going home became “far easier knowing there was a path that had already been taken by a woman who had seemed to find a semblance of happiness and acceptance in an environment where that always felt impossible”.Though White returned to live in London, she now regularly visits home. It is different now: she recently joined a park run and is happy to sit in the local pub reading a book, things she would never have considered before. She does not discount the notion of moving back permanently, either. So does she make sense there now? “Yes,” she says, “or maybe, being older, I’ve given up trying. But I’m comfortable in my queer identity there.”I was six the first time someone told me who I was. I’m pretty sure she – another child from our village – couldn’t have known exactly what a pansy meant. Neither did I. But we both definitely knew I was one, and that it was bad. From then on, I knew I didn’t make sense at home. I was always checking myself as a teenager, trying to take up as little space as possible, not drawing attention to myself. Still they came: taunts in school corridors or on the bus home. I was never physically assaulted, but I never felt safe. When I visited the house I grew up in, I rarely ventured far beyond its four walls.Twenty years went by like this. Then, three years ago, my mother became unwell and I started spending extended periods of time at home. She had dementia, and one aspect of caring for her meant taking on certain public roles on her behalf – in the GP’s surgery or the supermarket. I also engaged with relatives in a way I’d never had to before. It was a world I had previously shied away from. Now, I found myself hamming up the local in me, strengthening my Northern Irish accent in conversation or cracking jokes I thought people might get, in a bid to fit into a place I never had.But I was also suspicious. Those early traumas – homophobic remarks lobbed from the church pulpit or like a grenade from a speeding car – were hard to erase. Equally, I knew times had changed. Newry, where I went to school, is set to hold a major Pride event next year. The 2015 referendum on same-sex marriage in Ireland also signalled a dramatic shift in attitudes. We didn’t have equal marriage in Northern Ireland, but the noise about it was heartening.My father was the first on the phone to celebrate that Irish referendum result. Though we lived north of the border, as Catholics in a Republican area we took our social, political and cultural cues from Dublin. My mother came on next. “Congratulations!” she said. “What for?” I replied. “I’m not getting married.” “No,” she replied, “but you might.”One of the slightly farcical elements of LGBTQ life is that you never stop coming out. Introducing my boyfriend into the conversation with relatives and neighbours has been the easiest way to do so more widely, short of throwing a party. In the event, my boyfriend has been warmly welcomed. A male relative whose party piece is eye-wateringly risqué banter grappled sweetly with the right terminology, settling on “partner”, and has threatened to march in our local Pride.My mother died suddenly at the start of this year. We had a wake in our home, which is still the tradition around these parts, albeit a vanishing one. We welcomed about 700 people – family, friends, neighbours – into our house to grieve and laugh and drink a lot of tea with us. That girl was there, the one who was the first to say out loud who I am. I shook hands with her, and we chatted about what we’d been doing for the last 20 years. She’d stayed there, got married and had kids. I don’t expect she remembered the incident, or knew that, for me, the childhood episode had come to crystallise everything that was wrong with home.While I still live in London, I now feel able to move about my old home with relative ease. I go running in places I would previously have felt too vulnerable to venture. I have been reclaiming space in other ways, too. At my mother’s wake, I introduced my boyfriend to the local Catholic priest, who recovered enough to shake hands. He had to he was in my home, after all.Gina Ritch came out as a transgender woman in Edinburgh in 1999. They (the pronoun Ritch prefers) planned to transition, but couldn’t because work and money ran out. There followed many years of tumult, as Ritch struggled with work, relationships and their identity. Things came to a head in 2012, when Ritch had a nervous breakdown and decided that in order to live, they must transition – and at home, which is Unst, the most northerly of the Shetland Islands. Rich’s sister advised otherwise. “She said I should disappear again and transition in the city, where nobody knew me,” Ritch says. “But I thought, What the hell is the point if I am finally happy and feeling I have got to go and hide? No, no. I’m making my stand against all this bullshit. I’m going to do it here.”Ritch was born Paul Johnson Ritch in 1967 in Lerwick and grew up on Unst. An early memory set the tone: Ritch was about eight and had a new haircut, a bob. Their father came in, saw it and angrily chopped all the hair off. “That was very traumatic. I stayed under the radar after that.” As a young, feminine boy into art and music, Ritch didn’t fly under the radar for too long. They got into fights in nightclub car parks. They drank too much. They pursued women and cultivated a reputation as a local lothario. Ritch became a fisherman, a builder, a husband at 22, then a father to three children.“Having to live constantly in the macho persona drove me crazy,” Ritch says. “I kept trying to find somewhere where I could be me.” They would escape the island, try to reinvent themselves. Everything would fall apart again. So, in 2014, Ritch ended up back home. Transitioning there has not been easy, they tell me, as we talk over Skype. They travelled to Brighton for surgery medical appointments took place on the mainland.On a recent flight back from Glasgow, a fellow islander made a big show of asking which lady owned a handbag in the overhead locker (it was Ritch’s, although they couldn’t bring themselves to take the woman on). Do they ever reconsider living there? “Nah, I want to bust up this little crowd,” they laugh.Ritch is no wallflower. Shortly after Gina came out, they went on BBC Radio Shetland to speak about their decision. They turned up to their first shift at a summer job working in a tearoom in Unst in a vintage polka dot tea dress and a pair of slingbacks. They chose to sit with the girls for the class reunion photograph. Now Ritch works as a painter decorator, going into building supplies firms and people’s homes. “I put it out there,” Ritch says with a hint of mischief. “I thought, I’m not going to hide it. I’m going to be extra flamboyant, extra open and obvious, so people don’t think I’m skulking in a little croft house behind a hill scared of anybody.”Ritch has done the hard work now. The to-do list includes speech therapy and maybe learning to apply makeup with help from a neighbour, who is a beautician and one of many supporters on the island. But, after everything, this Shetlander wants to live somewhere in the sun, possibly mainland Europe. Ritch says they will come back for life’s set dramas – births, deaths, marriages – but they’re doing so on their terms: “Your home turf is the hardest and I’ll have to come back here. When I do, nobody is going to be shocked any more they know who I am. Now I can go in peace.”The East Shore in Criccieth is a quiet spot, once you get past the final batch of white bungalows. Just the sea, shore and the peaks of Snowdonia lie ahead. Peter Harlech Jones goes there with his dog. He regrets that he didn’t make it back here sooner that he didn’t get to be honest with his father. So he speaks to him. “I talk to him when I’m walking,” he says, “and I connect with him.”What does he say? He sighs. “I wish I’d understood you better. I wish I could have told you I was gay. And I wish you could have been here to see me now, because I think you would have been quite proud of me – and I would have loved you to have met Mike. My dad was mad on football, Mike’s mad on football and I think they would have got on really well. But it was never to be.”Still, others have made a homecoming for Harlech Jones. He remembers one occasion when he and Mike returned home to Criccieth to find a potted plant and a bottle of wine had been delivered. “And Mike said, ‘This lovely old gentleman’s been around – he says he’s your uncle David.’ He was my dad’s first cousin and he’s eightysomething. He’d heard from his daughter that we were back and just called to say he was so pleased we’d got a place here, and welcome home.”Harlech Jones’s eyes fill up. He looks across the bay and takes a long breath. “I thought, Christ, we’ve made it.”• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3738382.1545319500!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"photographs of 2018 nature and environment","story":"Gabi and Jonah Frank walk on the Pacific Coast Highway (above) as the Woolsey fire threatens their home in Malibu, California, in November.

Photograph: KeystoneGetty ImagesThat the official records from the Department of the Taoiseach and of Foreign Affairs for 1988 are becoming available only now after 30 years leaves the Irish side playing “catch-up” in Anglo-Irish relations.The British have long since begun their incremental switch from a 30-year rule to a policy which will eventually have them open all records after 20 years.And they have already released papers covering Margaret Thatcher’s demise, John Major’s accession, the tenure of Peter Brooke as Northern Ireland secretary and, on the Irish side, the replacement of Charles Haughey by Albert Reynolds.That Irish documents are not released simultaneously with the British causes difficulties for historians in reaching a rounded understanding of Anglo-Irish relations.In any consideration of the Haughey-Thatcher relationship there is the further complication that Thatcher published her memoirs in 1993, whereas Haughey never wrote his.There’s a hectoring tone in her memoirs which distorts the reality of Anglo-Irish relations. She scolds Haughey for his “thoroughly unhelpful attitude” and his “astonishing” speech in the US in April 1988 which she characterises as “a shabby case of playing to the American Irish gallery”.She ignores the content of his aide-memoire – reported in these pages on Friday – with its rebuke from Haughey that she had better allow him to be the best judge of shaping Irish policy.And when Haughey reaffirmed “in the strongest terms” his opposition to terrorism, and repeated his commitment to the Anglo-Irish Agreement she invites her readers to join with her in her delusion that he is responding to a “sharp letter” from herself.She claims that they concluded their summit meeting in Hanover without “any ill will or rancour”. And then surprised many readers when she wrote that she felt that she “understood him better than I had before – and better perhaps than I ever did Garret FitzGerald”.From Irish files of earlier years she had come across as a chameleon who seemed impressed by whoever she had spoken to most recently. There is nothing in the 1988 Irish papers to contradict this earlier impression that on Ireland she was irascible, shallow and very often uncertain on detail, which she would attempt to conceal with self-righteousness.Indeed Richard Ryan at the Irish Embassy in London seemed to liken her to a stubborn mule when he wrote of her during the protracted and difficult negotiations on the original Anglo-Irish Agreement, that she had “sat down between the shafts several times” and had to be “goaded forward toward the line” by Geoffrey Howe,\u0026nbspher cabinet secretary\u0026nbspRobert Armstrong, and others.He suggested that had “a really powerful Unionist voice” – he instanced Lord Hailsham – been there to counsel her, she would never have signed the agreement but that Armstrong had “kept such voices out and effectively sealed her in, against her own instincts, with persuasive voices, Irish and British, urging her in only one direction”.Haughey had also been a reluctant convert to the agreement. His record on it is riddled with contradictions and he is a master of spin and revisionism. Commenting to Thatcher on the agreement, he even claimed that it had been built “on the structures for closer co-operation between our two countries which you and I envisaged at our two meetings in 1980”.He allowed that in opposition he had been “critical of some aspects of the agreement”. He passed over that his initial response had been to excoriate it as treasonable, partitionist and unconstitutional.But Haughey said he now had an obligation to work the agreement. Not only was this a legal and moral imperative since as taoiseach he had inherited a binding international treaty. But he must also have quickly appreciated that the agreement was part of the furniture in Anglo-Irish relations.He must have been impressed too by the civil service team he had inherited on Anglo-Irish relations. Many belonged to a generation of specialists who had been recruited and promoted by Garret FitzGerald. Some indeed were personal friends of his.One would not expect, of course, to find traces in such official records of how the professional diplomats on the Irish side considered the replacement of FitzGerald by his arch rival – not least on Northern Ireland policy – Haughey. The officials’ approach to Haughey was now that of apolitical professionals.At one stage Noel Dorr as secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs does point out to the British ambassador Nicholas Fenn that Thatcher’s complaint that Haughey was dining à la carte on the Anglo-Irish Agreement, was “politically short-sighted”. Rather London should give the Haughey government “which came to the table after the menu had been selected, full credit for keeping to it so well”.But whereas Thatcher wished to rely on the agreement simpliciter, Haughey was invariably keen to widen the agenda.Throughout 1988 he talks about drawing unionists into discussions with Dublin. When the British ambassador Nicholas Fenn explicitly asked him his motives, Haughey replied: “I don’t know. I am playing it by ear. I am using some key words because Molyneux used them. In a way I am trying to send messages subliminally. There is no more to it than that.”But later in June the government secretary, Dermot Nally, in a note of a meeting with officials from both sides recorded the British view that the unionists merely wanted Haughey “to say or do something to scuttle the agreement. That was their sole purpose in the present dalliance.”Reading the files for 1988, Richard Ryan again emerges as an indefatigable harvester of gossip from within the Westminster elite on all aspects of Anglo-Irish relations in the wake of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, by then almost three years old.He advised Dublin that due to her simplistic analysis, Thatcher had isolated herself from what was a new more relaxed consensus among British ministers, officials and indeed the public. This was a belief that “the Irish as a whole were a fairly decent lot” who disliked terrorism as much as the British, and would help to fight it that the unionists had historically mistreated the Northern nationalists “and deserved the agreement” – indeed their inability to comprehend it “bore out their awfulness” and, moreover, that if as a result of the agreement the violence faded from British television screens and it all “led to unity in Ireland at some point in the future, well and good”.* Dr John Bowman is a broadcaster and historian.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe Taoiseach has said the first excavations at the site of the former Tuam mother-and-baby home will begin in the second half of next year and that Government does not know what it is “getting into” yet with the initiative.Leo Varadkar said legislation would have to pass through the Oireachtas before the work began but that the Cabinet had agreed to a “phased approach” to the forensic excavation and recovery of the remains.Following on from the work of Co Galway historian Catherine Corless, who gathered death certificates for 796 infants linked to the home, a Commission of Investigation into mother-and-baby homes found “significant quantities” of human remains in disused septic tanks in Tuam.Mother-and-baby homes were institutions generally run by nuns where women who became pregnant outside marriage gave birth. In the main these babies were adopted, often by Catholic families in the US, in return for a donation.The Bon Secours Sisters, which ran the home in Galway from 1925 to 1961, has offered €2.5 million towards the cost of the excavation. The State faces a bill of up to €12 million.Mr Varadkar said the Government had begun the work of identifying experts while the legislation makes its way through the Oireachtas ahead of any excavations. The initial work at the Tuam site will focus on the remains known to be in the chambers identified by the commission. Remains that are recovered will be analysed and, where possible, identified.“We’ve never really done this before in Ireland, on this scale, so we’ve a lot to set up, and a lot to learn before we do it,” Mr Varadkar told reporters during an end-of-year interview.“We’re not entirely sure what we’re getting into, but as a Government we’re convinced this is the right thing to do, to remove the remains and to give those children a proper, decent burial they didn’t get and if possible to identify some of them if we can, if the technology allows that.”Minister for Children Katherine Zappone wrote to Pope Francis on the issue after his visit to Ireland earlier this year. She explained the history of mother-and-baby homes in Ireland, the high mortality rates in them and the burial of children on the grounds of the former home in Tuam.The Minister sought from the pope that the church “accept its responsibilities and make reparation for its party in a very shameful chapter of Irish history”.In a three-paragraph response on Vatican-headed paper, dated November 13th, the pope said he was praying that “efforts made” by the Government and the Catholic Church in Ireland will help “face responsibly this tragic chapter in Ireland’s history”.He made no reference to a financial contribution to the excavation of unidentified human remains from the site of the former home."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3738067.1545308230!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"photographs of 2018 world","story":"German chancellor Angela Merkel with US president Donald Trump (above) at the G7 meeting in Quebec, in Canada, June.A Palestinian demonstrator who has just been hit in the face by a tear-gas canister fired by Israeli troops during a protest marking al-Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day, in the southern Gaza Strip in June.An injured child is comforted after shelling in Douma, in Syria, in February.Saleh Hassan al-Faqeh holds the hand of his four-month-old daughter, Hajar, who died in the malnutrition ward of al-Sabeen hospital, in Yemen, in November.An official opens the door to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in October.

Campaigners for a second EU referendum have accused Theresa May of weakness after one of Parliament’s most prominent Brexiteers was made a knight in the new year’s honours list.John Redwood was one of the Eurosceptic cabinet ministers branded “bastards” by John Major as he fought to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, and has continued to fly the anti-EU banner in the Commons ever since.He was among three MPs awarded knighthoods, alongside Conservative former minister Gary Streeter and Labour’s deputy chief whip Alan Campbell. With the crunch vote on Theresa May’s EU Withdrawal Agreement due within the next three weeks, Westminster has been buzzing with speculation that honours may be deployed as a means of luring MPs to back the Prime Minister.And a leading supporter of the Best for Britain campaign, Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, said the announcement brought “dishonour” on the honours system.“I cannot see how it is anything but a desperate attempt to blunt criticism of the prime minister’s Brexit deal by dangling a knighthood or two in front of MPs,” said Ms Moran.“All this does is erode trust in politics. Knights of the realm are meant to represent the best of being British, not backstabbing Brexit extremists like John Redwood.“It just shows how weak Theresa May is that she is seen to be rewarding him for his behaviour.”In an apparent attempt to reassure supporters that he will not be swayed by his gong, Mr Redwood published a blog just days ahead of the announcement of his honour outlining “Eight things wrong with the Withdrawal Agreement”.Mr Streeter, who backed Remain in the 2016 referendum, has already made clear that he supports the prime minister’s deal.A banker and academic, Mr Redwood headed the 10 Downing Street policy unit under Margaret Thatcher from 1982-87, where he was a champion of privatisation.He entered parliament as MP for Wokingham in 1987 and rose to cabinet rank in 1993 as Wales secretary, where his most memorable moment came when he attempted to mime the Welsh national anthem despite clearly not knowing the words.His clash with Mr Major over Europe came to a head in 1995 when the then prime minister called on his critics to “put up or shut up” and resigned to permit a leadership contest.Mr Redwood stood against him but received only 89 votes to Mr Major’s 219. After being defeated in a second bid for the leadership in 1997, he returned to the Tory frontbenches from 1997-2005 under William Hague and Michael Howard.An early supporter of an in-out referendum on Europe, Mr Redwood has argued since the 2016 Brexit vote for a clean break from the EU which he said should be “quick and easy”.The 67-year-old investment strategist said he considered his knighthood “a great honour”. Alongside his political work, he is a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford University and has supported the children’s charity, Variety.Mr Streeter (63) entered parliament in 1992 as MP for Plymouth Sutton and has represented a constituency in Devon since 1997.A solicitor by profession, he was a junior minister in the Lord Chancellor’s Department in the final years of the Major administration before serving as Mr Hague’s shadow international development secretary from 1998-2001.A committed Christian, he told PA that he hoped his honour came in part in recognition of his work over the past 10 years as the chairman of the all-party group on Christians in parliament and mentoring new MPs after their arrival at Westminster.Mr Campbell (61) was a history teacher before entering politics and has represented Tynemouth since 1997.He served as a whip in Tony Blair’s government and was a minister in the Home Office for two years under Gordon Brown.He was appointed opposition deputy chief whip by Ed Miliband in 2010 and remains in that position under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. “It is a great honour to receive this award. My first priority has always been and still is my constituency and that includes issues around the regeneration of seaside and coastal towns. If this award is a recognition of that, then that is great.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It was, however, a pleasing note on which to end the year for a prime minister who finds herself in a stronger position than she could have predicted when it started.After winning last week’s confidence vote, May is immune from further challenge to her leadership of the Conservative party for 12 months. And she ends the year amid a temporary cessation of hostilities against her from the DUP and her own backbench Brexiteers.The prime minister began 2018 with a cabinet reshuffle that served to highlight her diminished authority when a number of mid-ranking ministers refused to move.Weakened by the catastrophic 2017 general election that saw the Conservatives lose their parliamentary authority, May was under constant threat from within her own party throughout 2018.The prime minister’s weakness was a boon to Conservative Brexiteers led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, who left her in no doubt that her fate was in their hands.They cheered when she rejected the draft withdrawal agreement published by the EU in late February, which set out the details of the Northern Ireland backstop.But the prime minister allowed the reality of Brexit to intrude a few days later when she acknowledged in a speech at London’s Mansion House that Britain faced hard choices about its future relationship with the EU and that leaving the single market would affect British business.She had claimed in the past that Britain could have the “exact same benefits” in trade with the EU after Brexit as it does now.In her Mansion House speech, she admitted that “life is going to be different. In certain ways, our access to each other’s markets will be less than it is now”.May proposed varying levels of regulatory alignment with the EU for different sectors and a customs facilitation arrangement that fell short of a full customs union.By June, she was proposing an alternative version of the backstop that would see the whole of the United Kingdom, rather than just Northern Ireland, remain in a customs union with the EU.Brexiteers inside and outside cabinet held their fire while May saw off a rebellion from the pro-EU wing of her party over the EU withdrawal bill.But in early July she retreated with her cabinet to her country residence at Chequers to agree a new plan for Britain’s future relationship with the EU that would see it remain in full regulatory alignment for goods and agriculture, with a customs arrangement which would treat Britain and the EU as “a common customs territory”.Brexit secretary David Davis and foreign secretary Boris Johnson resigned in protest against the Chequers proposal, adding heft to the Brexiteer insurgency on the backbenches. If May was hoping for support from EU leaders, she got a rude awakening in September when they flatly rejected Chequers at a meeting in Salzburg.Although the prime minister complained that she was ambushed at the meeting, she provoked the confrontation by telling the other leaders that Chequers was a take-it-or-leave-it offer rather than a first step towards a deal.She would misjudge the EU 27 again at a summit in December when she told them to “keep nothing in reserve” in terms of concessions on the backstop. They told her they would not – and that the warm words in their formal conclusions was all she would get.By December, May had agreed a withdrawal agreement and political declaration with the EU but was unable to secure a majority for it at Westminster. Facing almost certain defeat, she postponed a vote on the deal until mid-January while she sought “reassurances” from Brussels that the backstop would be temporary if it is used at all.She survived the confidence vote in her leadership after promising to step down before the next election but more than a third of Conservative MPs voted against her.Some cabinet ministers are openly canvassing for the leadership and others are speculating in public about alternative options if the Brexit deal is rejected in January.May has promised Conservative backbenchers that she will win concessions from the EU on the backstop that will persuade the DUP to back the deal – a promise that appears to have no basis in the reality of what the EU is willing to offer.With her deal facing likely defeat, the prime minister rejects the idea of a second referendum, and a no-deal Brexit would be economically catastrophic.With no apparent way out, May trudges forward into 2019 at the head of a ided government and a hostile Parliament into the most perilous months in Britain’s post-war history, visionless, stubborn and indefatigable.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Anyone with any connection to the revolution will probably try to leave soon, maybe for areas controlled by Turkey in the Euphrates Shield.The town of some 100,000 people fell to moderate rebel fighters in the summer of 2012 before it was overrun by Isil jihadists in 2014. It was then captured by SDF in an anti-Isil offensive in 2016.The Kurds have used the cover of the war to carve out an autonomous state in northeastern Syria. However, their project seems increasingly under threat as Assad’s regime looks to reclaim the whole of Syria.Kurdish officials have told The  they would rather try their luck in negotiations with the regime than risk an all-out assault from neighbouring Turkey, which considers the YPG a terrorist group and has watched Kurdish expansion with growing concern.“The YPG accepts drinking the poison to stop a massacre. Do you prefer your people to be massacred by a brutal dictator like (Turkish president Recep Tayyip) Erdogan or be protected by a brutal dictator like Assad?” tweeted Kamal Chomani, a non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.Kurdish fighters from the People\u0026#39s Protection Units (YPG) run across a street in Raqqa during the offensive against IsilRussia, which has long called for the withdrawal of US troops “illegally” in Syria, welcomed the news on Friday, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov describing the development as a positive step that could help stabilise the situation.Speaking in frank terms on Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw 2,000 troops from Syria, Jeremy Hunt, Foreign Secretary, today said the US president “makes a speciality of talking in very black and white terms about what\u0027s happening in the world.”We have made massive progress in the war against Daesh (Arabic acronym for Isil), but it\u0027s not over and, although they have lost nearly all the territory they held, they still hold some territory and there is still some real risk, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.During a visit to Iraq this week, Mr Trump declared an end to the US role of being the world\u0027s policeman.Arab leaders have in recent days taken steps to rehabilitate the brutal Assad regime, with the UAE and Bahrain announcing they are to reopen embassies that had been shut since the beginning of the civil war.Please review our commenting policyGatwick drone sightings may have been of police equipment, chief constable admitsComment: The ABC Murders is excruciating liberal-Left drivel at its most spectacularComment: How funny to learn that our \u0026#39experts\u0026#39 once thought email would never catch onComment: The Queen deserves respect for quietlyReturned North Korean defectors paraded to lecture on miseries of capitalism they saw in ChinaMore than 240,000 NHS workers abandon \u0026#39gold-plated\u0026#39 pension planCasualties from crashes caused by slow drivers increase, as cautious elderly drivers partly blamedThe BBC rewrites Poirot\u0026#39s history, as the finale of its isive adaptation reveals detective was a priestPrimary school children told to ditch gadgets and write a letter instead in new government ‘bucket lists’Alison Saunders, much-criticised former CPS chief, becomes first not to receive top honourNew Year Honours 2019: Sir Michael Palin is knighted and Twiggy becomes a dameOne in ten members of clergy victims of violence as anti-Christian hate crimes risesScotland rugby great Doddie Weir among more than 100 Scots recognised in New Year HonoursExclusive: Civil servant accuses ministers of \u0026#39Project Fear Mark III\u0026#39 over no-deal BrexitSajid Javid resists calls for more boats to tackle Channel migrants -

What’s on the inside – someone’s character, drive, resilience, and the ability to stick to a goal - is just as important as their academic achievements.”Mr Hinds said he was inspired to create the initiative after visiting St Werburgh’s Primary School, in Bristol, where every child is encouraged to complete list of extra-curricular tasks.It said teachers will be able to tailor the lists, which will be sent out in January, to better reflect their area’s and pupils’ needs.Matt Hyde, Chief Executive of the Scouts, said: “We know how much young people get out of enrichment activities like these: broadening their experiences, having fun and developing skills for life.“Not everything can be taught in a classroom, so it\u0027s great to see Department for Education recognising the value of extra-curricular activities and encouraging young people to build confidence, resilience and get involved in their communities as well.”The children’s charity, the National Children’s Bureau, also welcomed the scheme saying it could help ease the surging rates of mental health problems being reported in schools.Anna Feuchtwang, Chief Executive of the National Children’s Bureau, added: “Part of the remedy lies in developing a firm foundation of wellbeing and resilience in children and young people, both at home and at school.”Department for EducationPlease review our commenting policyGatwick drone sightings may have been of police equipment, chief constable admitsComment: The ABC Murders is excruciating liberal-Left drivel at its most spectacularComment: How funny to learn that our \u0026#39experts\u0026#39 once thought email would never catch onComment: The Queen deserves respect for quietlyReturned North Korean defectors paraded to lecture on miseries of capitalism they saw in ChinaMore than 240,000 NHS workers abandon \u0026#39gold-plated\u0026#39 pension planThe BBC rewrites Poirot\u0026#39s history, as the finale of its isive adaptation reveals detective was a priestCasualties from crashes caused by slow drivers increase, as cautious elderly drivers partly blamedAlison Saunders, much-criticised former CPS chief, becomes first not to receive top honourNew Year Honours 2019: Sir Michael Palin is knighted and Twiggy becomes a dameOne in ten members of clergy victims of violence as anti-Christian hate crimes risesScotland rugby great Doddie Weir among more than 100 Scots recognised in New Year HonoursExclusive: Civil servant accuses ministers of \u0026#39Project Fear Mark III\u0026#39 over no-deal BrexitSajid Javid resists calls for more boats to tackle Channel migrants - as he declares a \u0026#39major incident\u0026#39Lawyers who drew up Sir Philip Green gagging orders should face inquiry, says MPComment: The Civil Service is ready for a no deal – but does the Government want you to think otherwise?Getty oil tycoon\u0026#39s grandson is caught up in row about privacy near Buckinghamshire pileComment: From vegans to Brexit, us farmers are preparing to battle through one heck of a 2019We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"queens message show mutual respect quietly improves conversation","story":"Wanting, as we always do, to be first with the news, the media tried to get something going in advance about this year’s Queen’s Christmas message. ‘She will say,’ we suggested, something or other about Brexit.I always attend carefully to Her Majesty’s Christmas messages.

In “Playtest”, starring Wyatt Russell, the front cover of\u0026nbspEdge\u0026nbspmagazine indicates that there is a review of “Bandersnatch”\u0026nbspinside. In the scene, Sonja uses the magazine to encourage Cooper to take a mysterious job with video game company SaitoGemu.\u0026nbspThe episode opens with Stefan at home with his father, a widow, offering him a choice of breakfast cereal (the first decision the user is faced with). From there, he travels to an interview with a\u0026nbspgames company so he can pitch his idea for a game adaptation of the multiple choice novel, Bandersnatch, which was written by a man who descended into madness as he completed it.\u0026nbspAt the office, he is introduced to Colin Ritman\u0026nbsp(Coulter), Stefan\u0027s hero, and a man with whom you can have either a lot or barely any interaction with, depending on the choices you make. Throughout the film there are loops that guide you back to the correct narrative if you stray too far, such as when Stefan is asked whether he wants to work in the office or at home, on his own. The home option is preferred as it leads to Stefan\u0027s own slow descent into madness as he becomes obsessed with completing Bandersnatch.As he works, he becomes more and more irritated by interruptions from his father, and trips to his therapist. You can learn during therapy\u0026nbsp(as we did in this version of the story) that his mother died in a train crash after Stefan caused her to miss an earlier train – an event that likely triggered\u0026nbsphis current mental health issues.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Every Black Mirror episode ranked – from worst to best Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Click through for our ranking of every Black Mirror episode to date620 Hated in the NationBandersnatch, “Hated in the Nation” is Brooker’s answer to Scandi Noir dramas such as The Killing.

And yet the tender San Junipero, which sees two women fall in love in a seaside town that naturally isn’t quite what it seems, is a rare instance of optimism from Brooker’s generally fatalistic imagination, and we can’t help but love it for that.

It was the first to put Brooker\u0027s spin on disturbed technological advancements to truly devastating effect, tracking the dissolution of a marriage (of Toby Kebbell and Jodie Whittaker) in a world where memories can be re-lived as easily as switching on a television. It\u0027s the presence of Tom Cullen\u0027s charismatic male that causes Kebbell\u0027s character to frantically pore over every part of his wife\u0027s behaviour, convincing himself she\u0027s had an affair. Where other Black Mirror episodes introduce expansive worlds, this places the action in the most relatable of settings – the home – and is all the more disturbing for it. Essential viewing.It transpired that we managed to jump on one of the speedier narratives for the film, which comes\u0026nbspto a rather gory conclusion when\u0026nbspStefan bludgeons\u0026nbsphis father to death, but manages to complete the game. Bandersnatch is released to rave reviews, as a current-day news report informs us that Stefan was later arrested and charged with his father\u0027s murder.\u0026nbspThis writer was slightly sceptical at how Netflix is managing to get viewers to watch the episode countless times to see the various endings... meaning mega streams for them. At first the interactions are fun, but the constant interruptions to the story as you\u0027re asked to make yet another decision on Stefan\u0027s behalf can become\u0026nbspquite wearisome, and if anything it pulls you out of the story rather than allowing\u0026nbspyou to become engrossed in it.Netflix says of the new interactive film: “There are choices to be made, challenges to overcome, dangers to encounter and, as always in life (and Black Mirror), consequences to be had. Choosing wisely could lead to triumph while taking the wrong path could end in disaster – but who’s to say what’s ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, anyway? And fret not because once one experience comes to a close, you can – and should! – go back and make a new choice, alter the path of your story and maybe even change its outcome.”The liveblog has now closed.\u0026nbspInteractive film was released on Netflix today (Friday 28 December)Bandersnatch\u0026nbspoffers viewers the chance to decide the fate of its lead character, computer game creator\u0026nbspStefanAudience members can choose anything from the song he decides to listen to, to whether he attends a therapy sessionNetflix also confirmed that there are “five main endings with multiple variants of each”... although fans could uncover more depending on the choices they make, allowing for a little extra mystery.\u0026nbspRead our review of\u0026nbspBandersnatch,\u0026nbsphere.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But the scale of the 2018 losses have left some cryptocurrency experts questioning whether bitcoin will once again see a market turn-around.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPredicting bitcoin\u0027s fortunes in 2019 has therefore ided analysts, with forecasts from high-profile figures within the cryptocurrency industry ranging from a complete capitulation, to a 10-fold increase from today\u0027s price of $3,650.The most radical predictions come from bitcoin cash founder Calvin Ayre and Fundstrat\u0026nbspco-founder Thomas Lee.

He was holding a print-out of the draft of an article I’d written. “You did law, didn’t you,” he stated. It was true, my degree was in law. I nodded.\u0026nbsp“What’s this?” He asked, pointing to his desk. “It’s a desk,” I said. “Well f*****g well say so. Don’t say, ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs, and therefore might be a desk.’ It’s a desk.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI can’t tell you how often I’m reminded of Bambridge’s words. There is hardly a day that goes by when I don’t see a piece of writing or hear a speech that is pure verbiage, and can only have been produced by a lawyer or a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe latest example is particularly shocking. When I last looked, BT was supposed to be a communications company. Okay, telecommunications. But a corporation, nevertheless, that ought to pride itself on directness and speed of delivery. In that context, the ability of the receiver to comprehend should be paramount.\u0026nbspUnited Airlines mocked for corporate speak response to passenger rowSo, take this, from BT as it promises to overhaul its pay policies after the investor backlash following the £2.3m package handed to departing boss Gavin Patterson. The company will consider “a broader range of performance factors and wider circumstances” when determining executive remuneration. It also pointed to “a more structured process to help it step through the application of its discretion in the future.”Eh? Who writes this stuff? Clearly, not someone who believes in telling it how it is, and is unable to say something for definite without suffocating it in qualification. That has to be a lawyer, or as I say, a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe problem with this approach is that it suggests an organisation that is hidebound, stricken with fear, unable to proceed without a high degree of caution, incapable of saying “we screwed up, and we’re sorry”. Patterson received too much –\u0026nbspperhaps not under the strict terms of his contract –\u0026nbspbut, given the company’s poor showing, too much.\u0026nbspDecisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out.But BT cannot admit that, oh no. It won’t try to claw back the money as that would be unseemly, and besides, the lawyers have probably advised that would be difficult. Instead, it attempts to sooth and gloss over with words straight out of the lawyers’ lexicon of “safe” twaddle.\u0026nbspSlight as it is, in the overall picture of a multi-billion pound global empire, BT’s announcement about leaders’ pay is indicative of a loss of way, a lack of confidence. Intuition has succumbed to process.\u0026nbspWith any management there should be room for both, for the heart and the head. Of course, things have to be done properly and carefully, but they also need to be done. Decisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out. It is not the answer.Too often, I’ve seen the lawyers rule the roost. On a product safety issue, where fatalities had ensued, they were reluctant to let the management meet the relatives and express their condolences, because this could lead to an admission of liability. In another episode, involving a food company, they took the same line. Again, after a tragedy, a holiday operator was told on no account to contact the family.\u0026nbspWhile lawyers may give their advice for the best of intentions, to avoid the client being shredded in the law courts, and having to pay out vast sums, they do not afford enough attention to that other court, the one of public opinion –\u0026nbspand the one that these days, especially with instant relaying of news, 24-hour bulletins and social media, is increasingly vital.\u0026nbspThere’s little point in shoring up a legal defence, in cloaking a company’s actions in legal procedure and its outpourings in law-speak, if it simply makes the company the subject of derision, and harms its reputation.\u0026nbspSurely\u0026nbspit’s not beyond the wit of any intelligent C-suite member to say they share the loved ones’ pain, without stating there and then, it was the company’s fault? Likewise, is it really impossible for BT to say it recognises, and is concerned about investors’ frustrations, and will do its utmost to prevent a recurrence?Ask any business chief what keeps them awake at night, and they will say loss of reputation –\u0026nbspto the business, and to them, personally. It’s humans who determine how they and their organisation are judged, the basis for that\u0026nbsp reputation. Be human in everything they do, is the easiest way of achieving plaudits. That means being human in how they communicate, and in their actions.\u0026nbspPlease BT, in future, before you press “send”, stand back and read what you’re about to convey. Listen to the lawyers, but, remember, you’re human and you’re talking to humans.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Government shutdown likely to extend into the new yearMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunStock markets steady after worst Christmas Eve in Wall Street historyHowever, analysts are stumped as to exactly why markets have moved so dramatically in recent days, with Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp describing the situation as “completely bizarre”. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides,” he added.Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the movement was “certainly unusual for this time of year”, and noted that normally in December “you see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility”.Wall Street’s recovery in the second half of this week has helped boost European and Asian markets, with the FTSE 100 rising 2.2 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by Opec and non-Opec as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme.

Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b.

And I love him and that – I don’t blame him. But I was angry, and I got into trouble,” he says.“I had the Old Bill round my gaff every five minutes. I was a wrong ’un. No one knew how to help me. Then I found a father figure I didn’t even know I needed.“I went for an audition for a play and I met this old geezer who wrote it. He was an East Ender, he was a West Ham fan just like me. He thought I was alright and he gave me the part. Turns out it was a fella called Harold Pinter.“He became the most influential man in my life… He taught me that where I came from didn’t dictate where I went to.”He goes on to add: “Life can get a little stressful and we might get on each other’s nerves a bit, but remember how much there is to be proud of, to be grateful of, and get yourself a Harold, you know, if you can … Merry Christmas, my loves.”Danny Dyer’s Alternative Christmas Message airs on Christmas Day at 3.50pm on Channel 4Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The major update – which would have been perhaps the biggest change to Instagram ever – was so widely despised that numerous users suggested the app is now dead.But very shortly after, the change appeared to be reverted and the feed went back to normal. And now it appears all of that happened by accident.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Sorry about that, this was supposed to be a very small test but we went broader than we anticipated,” Instagram head Adam Mosseri wrote on Twitter, alongside an awkward-looking emoji. The change went to “a few orders of magnitude more people than intended”, he wrote.He said the change “should already be rolled back”. If it is still appearing, he told users they should “simply restart your app and you should be good to go”, Mr Mosseri advised.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost. You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily. Just go to your profile, hit the three dots at the top and select Posts You’ve Liked. You can also save posts in a folder only you can see by tapping the bookmark icon underneath it. Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon. If you’re tagged in a picture you don’t want other people to see, go to your profile, hit the photos of you icon, tap the three dots at the top of the screen and choose Hide Photos.811 Secure your accountMake your Instagram account much harder to hack by enabling two-factor authentication, a security feature that protects you even if your login details are stolen.

The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/02/17/instagram.jpg","title":"instagram update latest scrolling why reverse old version guide swipe","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  The message that pops up when the update arrives offers some clue about why this happened: Stories.Instagram update completely changes how users scroll through feedInstagram notes that the feature is more similar to the Stories tool that rolled out in 2016, allowing people to post disappearing photos and videos that could be clicked through in exactly the same way. It even tells people that they can use the same feed in just the same way.Since 2016, Stories has become probably the most quickly growing kind of media ever to be launched: not just on Instagram but everywhere on the web, the side-swiping, clicky way of getting through an app has spread itself across the entire internet. Instagram Stories is now twice as big as rival Snapchat, and makes up a major part of the way people use the app.Presumably excited by the vast popularity of those Stories, Instagram has decided to make everything else work that way, too.It is worth noting that even as Stories have gone from strength to strength, and Instagram has continued to grow, the company\u0027s founders also recently left the company. That was because of disputes with owners Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg about the direction of the company, according to a report in Bloomberg\u0026nbsp– and it may be that features such as these were the cause of those disagreements.It seems to be on its way to everybody, though that doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll definitely have got it yet. Force quitting the app and scrolling around a little appears to make the new feature most likely to arrive.Usually, new Instagram features – especially ones like this, which bring dramatic changes – are rolled out slowly, to a small group of people first and then gradually to everybody else. But this appears to have come in one fell swoop, on Thursday afternoon UK time.They hate it. Almost everybody seems to absolutely despise the update.Searching for the word Instagram on Twitter brings a whole host of posts, many including explicit language unfit for this website.Give me back my timeline, one illustrative but relatively family-friendly post reads.\u0026nbspThis update SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In short: no. Instagram isn\u0027t giving its users the ability to use the old format, even temporarily: once the update has arrived, it has arrived forever, by the looks of things.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Once the programme is over, the same service will cost £45 for most phones, and a full £65 for the iPhone X.Apple gives governments increased access to phone dataThe iPhone X recently became eligible for the throttling, which Apple still applies to more strained batteries to ensure they perform properly. One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/01/20/instagram.jpg","title":"new instagram update revert back scrolling swipe left feed change feature","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily.

Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon.

Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them.

This time around, almost everyone got the update within a matter of minutes. If people weren\u0027t seeing it when they opened their app, force quitting and scrolling around appeared to prompt the app to update.Why Instagram just completely changed its feedBut now some users report that the change has switched back, with the feed going upright all over again. It\u0027s not clear whether that is a bug – or whether the rollout itself had happened by accident, or early.Instagram had clearly meant for the update to go live at some point, since an instructional card popped up to explain that the change had been made and what users now had to do.There doesn\u0027t appear to be any way to make the feed change back. Instagram is not giving the option to revert to the old feed, even temporarily.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/09/02/08/crrbjjdxyae7doo.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-4633446  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/09/02/08/crrbjjdxyae7doo.jpg","title":"samsung galaxy s10 leak camera feature specs dslr bokeh lens release","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

On Monday the Dow Jones closed at its worst point since September 2017, the S\u0026ampP 500 hit its lowest mark since April 2017 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at its worst point since July 2017.By contrast, when markets reopened on Wednesday the Dow Jones recorded its largest ever single-day increase while the S\u0026ampP 500 and Nasdaq both rose by 5 per cent.

Markets have also been rocked by general global political and economic uncertainty: Donald Trump is said to be preparing to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, and the US government shutdown is set to continue into the new year. Government shutdown likely to extend into the new yearMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunStock markets steady after worst Christmas Eve in Wall Street historyHowever, analysts are stumped as to exactly why markets have moved so dramatically in recent days, with Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp describing the situation as “completely bizarre”. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides,” he added.Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the movement was “certainly unusual for this time of year”, and noted that normally in December “you see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility”.Wall Street’s recovery in the second half of this week has helped boost European and Asian markets, with the FTSE 100 rising 2.2 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by Opec and non-Opec as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

My mum has been here since 1960. London is her home. She came here, fell in love, had myself and my sisters and brought us up here. We’re all proud of being British,” she told The Independent.Cazzato (right) and her 87-year-old mother Ana\u0026nbspMaria Dance“It’s the first I’d heard of it and at first I thought it may be a joke, but it looks like it’s not. If you’ve come here and made it your home, worked here and paid tax to support the country, why should you be reapplying?\u0026nbsp“It’ll break my mum’s heart to be told she may have to leave the UK if they deny her permission to stay. I know a lot of Spanish people and Italian people who have been here for years and it’s going to affect them too.”EU national Dion Di Miceli, who has lived and worked in the UK for 30 years taxpayer, said: “I should pay money to continue living in my home? And what about those who are unable to fill in these forms, such as elderly EU nationals with dementia?”Johnny Taylor echoed his sentiments, tweeting: “Why should my partner who has lived and worked here for almost 14 years have to apply?“It’s an insult to her and the millions of other EU nationals who have contributed to the UK economy.

A disastrous idea from HuntAt customs in the Russian capital Ms Brady told the receptionist about the horses’ ordeal which “elicited in response the sad tale of the Finnish ambassador’s parrot”.The cable goes on: “The receptionist, an animal-lover and close to tears at the thought of the parrot, relented and led us through a maze of ceiling-high packing cases in the enormous warehouse.\u0026nbsp“And there we found the staff of the twelfth diplomatic customs post playing poker.“Fifteen dollars poorer but with the customs formalities completed we hotfooted it to the station accounts office in south Moscow.”Finding that office closed, they returned the next day to discover that as the horses had been in the station for 24 hours they needed to be re-checked by a vet.The cable continues: “The vet was in her office adding up extremely slowly a long list of figures on a calculator with dodgy batteries.\u0026nbsp“The numbers kept fading, at which point she began again at the top of the list.”\u0026nbspAfter an hour of this frustrating scene they got the necessary paperwork.But as preparations were made to transport the horse-box Ms Brady noticed the three grooms who had travelled with the animals “began to carry countless sacks of potatoes, onions, carrots and at least 200 large melons”.It adds: “One groom explained that as Turkmenistan had no post-1992 banknotes they were forced to bring wares to sell in Moscow to be able to buy the return ticket to\u0026nbspAshkabad.”The manure-filled carriage had to be cleaned before they could leave the railway siding, so a train driver was bribed with “several particularly large” melons to move down the track where it could be “unceremoniously scraped out onto the track”.With both horses finally in quarantine awaiting transit, Ms Brady signs off: “I have made some useful contacts over the last few days so the next time we want to import a horse to Russia it will be a doddle.”Mr Major wrote a thank-you note, saying: “Your splendid account of how to put a\u0026nbspTurkmeni\u0026nbsphorse into quarantine was the most enjoyable document the Private Office have put into my weekend box in a very long time.“I am most grateful to you for your valiant and amusing efforts, in this noble cause.”Created with Sketch.

independent equine experts who was helping get the horse to the UK, had a conviction for fraud.After the story was published, senior civil servants advised the prime minister against accepting Mr Meddes’ offer to withdraw from the operation on the grounds that the horseman had “served his sentence for his crime, so it’s a bit odd if we bar him from helping”.But in a handwritten note, a senior civil servant made it clear he was looking forward for foreign office guidance on “the general position of the horse, when will it arrive, and when can we forget the whole saga”.Maksat\u0026nbspeventually settled in stables in Carmarthenshire, Wales after being deemed too temperamental by the Household Cavalry.Stable-owner Lorna Winn-Jones, who took him in, told WalesOnline in 2012: “Maksat\u0026nbspcame to me in 1996 a sad, confused and troubled little horse with a few health issues but blossomed into a powerful and confident stallion who seems happy in his adopted home of Wales.“Maksat\u0026nbspstill belongs to John Major in the sense that he was given to him but he doesn’t visit.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

With ministers now promising a total of around 2,500 per year until 2022, it means the increased funding will deliver\u0026nbsponly an additional 1,000 each year.In contrast, 39,402 were built\u0026nbspin 2009-10 –\u0026nbspthe year before the Conservatives came to power.In October, Ms May announced that her government was increasing\u0026nbspfunding for the\u0026nbspAffordable Homes Programme by £2bn, taking the total to almost\u0026nbsp£9bn.Heralding the move, the prime minister said she was making it\u0026nbspher personal “mission” to tackle the housing crisis and assured those in need of\u0026nbspa better home that “help is on\u0026nbspthe way”.But in answer to a parliamentary question from Labour, housing secretary James Brokenshire said just one in 20 of the new homes to be built\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspbe social homes.\u0026nbspHe said: “The £9bn Affordable Homes Programme will deliver at least 250,000 homes by March 2022. At least 12,500 of these will be for social rent outside of London.“The Greater London Authority has the flexibility to deliver social rent in London.”Commenting on the revelation,\u0026nbspJohn Healey, Labour’s shadow housing secretary, said: “There’s been a disastrous fall in the number of new genuinely affordable homes for social rent under the Conservatives. We are now building over 30,000 fewer social rented homes a year than when I was Labour’s last housing minister in 2010.“Ministers’ flawed definition of ‘affordable housing’ includes homes for sale at up to £450,000 and to let at 80 per cent of market rents, so it’s just not good enough for ministers to only commit a tiny fraction of the affordable homes budget to new social rented homes. The next Labour government will build a million low-cost homes, the majority for social rent.”Addressing the Conservative Party conference in October, Ms May promised “a new generation of council houses to help fix our broken housing market”.She said: “In those parts of the country where need is greatest we will allow social rented housing to be built, at well below market levels, getting the government back into the business of building houses.”And during the 2017 election campaign, Ms May promised the Tories would deliver “a new generation of social rented homes”.44bn to supporting the housing marketHousing charities condemned the revelation\u0026nbspthat the\u0026nbspgovernment will only fund 2,500 new social homes per year.Greg Beales,\u0026nbspcampaign director of\u0026nbspShelter, said: “The gap between the number of social homes we need in this country and how many get built is vast. In fact, we delivered 84 per cent\u0026nbspfewer social homes this year than in 2010. This is totally unacceptable when hundreds of thousands of people are homeless and millions more are struggling in unstable and expensive private renting.\u0026nbsp“It is time the government charted a new course and seriously ramped up its efforts to get more social homes built. That’s why Shelter has launched an independent commission into the future of social housing that will soon set out a bold and far-reaching vision for the pivotal role it has to play in ending the housing crisis.”And Jon Sparkes, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, said: “It is very disappointing to see such a tiny proportion of the properties to be delivered through the Affordable Homes Programme being made available for social rent. Research shows we need 90,000 social homes built every year for the next 15 years to meet demand – both for those experiencing homelessness, and for those on low incomes, many of whom are at risk of homelessness.“The current lack of genuinely affordable housing is leaving thousands living on a knife-edge, unable to keep up with spiralling rents and housing costs.”Kit Malthouse, housing minister, said:\u0026nbsp“Over the last three decades governments of all stripes have built too few homes of all types, including for affordable and social rent.“We’re correcting this with massive investment in house building, including the £9bn affordable homes programme, but also by setting councils free to build the social homes their communities need.“We expect many thousands of new homes to result and we share the impatience of the British people to see decent homes built for the next generation.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

I want us to have a vote as soon as possible, that’s what I’ve been saying for the past two weeks, and if that means recalling parliament to have the vote let’s have it.\u0026nbsp“But it looks to me the government has once again reneged on that and tried to put it back another week.\u0026nbspWe need to have that vote so\u0026nbspa decision of parliament can be made. What I suspect is that it’s a completely cynical manoeuvre to run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea.”Corbyn hails the Good Samaritan in Christmas messageThe House was last recalled during the EU referendum campaign in June 2016 to pay tributes to the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox. This was the 29th recall during a recess period since 1948.\u0026nbspOther issues MPs have been ordered back to Westminster over included a debate over the use of chemical weapons in Syria in 2013, and the riots in London and other English cities in 2011.In order for parliament to be recalled,\u0026nbspthe speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, must receive a formal request from the government which he would\u0026nbspthen consider and make a judgement on.As it stands, MPs will return on 7 January after a two week Christmas recess, but the prime minister has already summoned her cabinet a week earlier on 2 January to discuss no-deal preparations.Corbyn pledges to end law which criminalises rough sleepersMr Corbyn added that the government should not have gone into recess without a vote on the deal: “The prime minister and the Tory chief whip agreed the timetable motion, we agreed the timetable motion which was a five day debate, and it was put at that time at that week to ensure the select committees could have a chance over a week to comment on the agreement before it was put to parliament.“I agreed with...\u0026nbspI thought that was a sensible way of doing it. You would have the process in the EU, you had Theresa May agreeing it with the EU, you then had a short gap, about a week, in which everyone could analyse it and consider it and then come back to the House for a five day debate and then a vote.”He continued: “Three days into that they, the government, unilaterally pulled it and that shows the weakness of the system in the House of Commons where essentially the government holds the aces because they control the programme.“I said this to the parliamentary Labour Party and it\u0026nbspwas seen as a slightly odd thing to say – I said, actually, for a party that wants to go into government, I want to see the House of Commons stronger than it is, not weaker than it is, because\u0026nbspgovernments should be held to account by the parliament.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The steam locomotive U Class 31806 makes its way past Corfe Castle during the Winter Warm Up on the Swanage Railway in DorsetThe scene in Launcelot Close, Andover, where the body of a man has been found after an explosion caused a building to collapseShoppers enter the Selfridges store on Oxford Street during the Boxing Day sales in LondonBarbary macaques at Blair Drummond Safari Park have a great time finding the tasty morsels hidden amongst the wrapped parcels given to them by keepers.

The first time a match has been played in the stadium since the owners helicopter crashTransport Minister Jo Johnson has resigned in protest of the Government\u0027s Brexit plan and called for a Final Say referendumBut Labour itself is not without its own internal battles over Brexit. Asked to pinpoint the most difficult moment of 2018, Mr Corbyn said it was “bringing the party together over attitudes towards Brexit and the European Union”.\u0026nbspHe said the unanimity achieved at party conference was designed to bring both leavers and remainers together on two things: “The direction of social and economic policy by the Labour Party, and the other is of course the relationship with the European Union.”Now Mr Corbyn is facing demands from anti-Brexit activists within the party to convene an emergency conference to reevaluate the party’s strategy in the coming weeks – ahead of any vote – but the Labour leader said he did not “at this stage see the need for a special conference”.“A special conference would take some time to organise anyway,” he added. “I think we do have the agreement of conference on the overall position, and we do have a very large and representative national executive. But obviously if the national executive wanted to hold a special conference they would say so, but I have not had any indications of that from members.”In the interview, Mr Corbyn also claimed he was “totally” ready for any snap election, saying the party had already selected candidates in all of its marginal seats.\u0026nbspOne path towards a general election would be through tabling a motion of no confidence in the government. If it passed and a new government attracting the support of a majority of the House cannot be formed within 14 days, parliament is dissolved and a vote triggered.Pressed on whether Labour intends to make such a move in the coming weeks, Mr Corbyn said: “We’ve made clear it’s a question of when not if we do a vote of no confidence in the government, and obviously we do at a time when their confidence is the lowest ever, which I suspect will be after they’ve lost the vote.”\u0026nbspHe would not be “tied to a date”, but said if Ms May loses the vote “we will obviously make our views clear in the House”.“I’m not certain what the result would be,” he added. “We would obviously put a case of no confidence with the government at an appropriate time.”But if Mr Corbyn’s wish of forcing a snap election fails to come to fruition, the next vote is scheduled for May 2022 – and the prime minister has already said on the record she will hand over the keys to No 10 to one of her Tory colleagues before that vote.\u0026nbspIf he remains in post as Labour leader, Mr Corbyn will be facing his third prime minister as Labour leader. He chose not to name who his preferred challenger would be when Ms May resigns, however, and said he did not want to “ruin somebody’s chances by naming a favourite”.Asked whether he ever felt sorry for the prime minister – an emotion expressed by the former Labour leader Tony Blair – Mr Corbyn said: “At a human level I have great interest in other people and I often feel sympathy for the positions people have got themselves into.\u0026nbsp“But then I also look at her cabinet, look at the decisions they are making, look at the way in which universal credit impacts on the poorest, look at the levels of poverty around this country, and I feel angry and disgusted that we are just tolerating the institutionalisation of food banks, begging, rough sleeping in this country.\u0026nbsp“No, it’s a symptom of a deep malaise of 10 years of frozen wages and lack of investment.”Due to the unremitting sense of crisis at the top of the government and a prime minister struggling to retain any degree of authority, one of the criticisms often levelled at Mr Corbyn is that Labour should now be at least 10 points ahead in the opinion polls. Instead, the party is often on a level pegging with the Conservatives.\u0026nbspWhen questioned on this, Mr Corbyn replied: “I wish we had even more support than we do have, but we have fought many election campaigns, many local election campaigns, and we did win councils that people said would be very difficult to win back.\u0026nbsp“I would also say, generally speaking, the only time that the majority of the media have given us anything like a fair hearing was during the election campaign, and rapidly after the election campaign they reverted to type and we’ve had unremitting hostility from most of the media ever since then, and we continue to have it.”Referring to an incident in the Commons last week when he was accused of calling the prime minister a “stupid woman” – he later denied this, saying he said “stupid people” – Mr Corbyn said Labour’s strength was getting out its message through social media.\u0026nbspPMQs session\u0026nbspFollowing the bustup in the chamber, the Islington North MP said a video produced by his team the following day, which also criticised the media, received half a million views in just a few hours.\u0026nbspBut before he intends to build on the party’s social media output and daily campaign work, Mr Corbyn said he will bring in the new year with his wife, Laura Alvarez.\u0026nbsp“I don’t drink so there’s not much celebration in that sense,” he said. “We will enjoy the new year, Laura and I. We look forward to a new\u0026nbspyear.\u0026nbspAnd I always make sure in my own life that I\u0026nbspwork very hard at my job – and I do a lot of travelling and working and I love being a constituency MP – but I also make sure I have other things to do.

– all of whom had backed Leave in the 2016 referendum – were awarded knighthoods or damehoods.They included Graham Brady, the chairman of the powerful backbench 1922 Committee, who went on to play a crucial role when his fellow Conservatives finally triggered a vote of no confidence in the prime minister.In an attempt to reassure supporters of his convictions, Mr\u0026nbspRedwood\u0026nbsppublished a blog days before the honour outlining, “Eight things wrong with the withdrawal agreement”.The former banker, who ran the Downing Street policy unit under

“brings dishonour on the honours system”.“I cannot see how it is anything but a desperate attempt to blunt criticism of the prime minister’s Brexit deal by dangling a knighthood or two in front of MPs,” the Best for Britain supporter said.“This is all happening just a couple of weeks before the critical Brexit vote.”Mr Streeter, 63, who voted Remain in 2016, has spoken out in favour of the prime minister’s Brexit deal.The former minister, who has represented Plymouth Sutton since 1992 and then South West Devon since 1997, said: “I am deeply honoured.“As far as I am concerned, I want to dedicate the award to my wife and family for supporting me through the last quarter of a century at Westminster, which has involved sacrifice on their part.”Long-serving Labour whip Mr Campbell also received a knighthood, which he welcomed as a recognition of his work in his Tynemouth constituency.\u0026nbspWhitehall honours included a knighthood for Roy Stone after more than 40 years in the civil service under seven prime ministers, and a CBE for\u0026nbspMs May’s\u0026nbspdeputy principal private secretary, William Macfarlane.Around\u0026nbsp70 per cent of awards were handed\u0026nbspto

When it is strong, the vortex is concentrated over the Arctic or Antarctic area.But when it is weak – which is more frequent – it can split into two or more freezing vortices.The phenomenon associated with wintry weather is known as a Sudden Stratospheric Warming.These cover a larger area and can move south to Canada, the USA and Europe, increasing the risk of air temperatures decreasing to potentially dangerous levels."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/as-kavanagh-cartoon.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"all starts in spring brexit opinion","story":"Not only has Mrs May made me look foolish by clinging to her job, she seems to have defied gravity and learned how to fly.The PM has pencilled in another year’s lease on No and could even survive until the next Election — perhaps within that same year. This might not be good news to those who, like me, believe she has made a dog’s Brexit of EU negotiations, but it would be unchristian on Christmas Eve to ignore Mrs May’s transformation.She seems almost to have shrugged off the crushing burden of responsibility and begun to enjoy herself. Voters have noticed. At ious pre-Christmas gatherings, I have been struck by expressions of warmth for Mrs May personally, even among hardened Brexiteers.So, in the spirit of Christmas, let’s put dferences aside and raise a glass to the PM’s health and happiness.She has benefited from the ghastliness of her enemies — the thuggish European Commision, drunken groper Jean Claude Juncker, biased Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow and snide Jeremy Corbyn. Their mean-spirited sneers have stirred a passion for the underdog among fair-minded Brits — surprisingly, more among men than women.It is refreshing to see bellowing toad Bercow, a toxic stain on the centuries-old tradition of Speaker impartiality, finally at bay over allegations of abuse of his high office. Bercow’s blatant contempt for Parliament coincides with Corbyn’s disintegration and Labour’s irrelevance.Only last week Corbyn was held up as the scary monster who would eat us alivegiven the chance. Today he stands shredded for all to see, as a pathetic non-entity who somehow became Leader of HM Opposition.Corbyn feebly denies live TV evidence of him branding Theresa May a “stupid woman”.  He is entitled to his opinion but it is demeaning to lie about it. No wonder two of his closest MPs, Fiona Onasanya and Kate Osamor, have also been caught lying through their teeth. And they are just the ones brought to the attention of police.Suddenly, far from Corbyn sweeping to power as Britain’s first Marxist PM, polls suggest he would be thrashed in a snap Election, with the Tories regaining their outright majority.  But perhaps not under this leader.Which brings me to another reason to be cheerful. Boris Johnson has been cleared of trumped-up charges of Islamophobia levelled by Tory chairman Brandon Lewis, spurred on by Mrs May herself.In an article supporting the right of Muslim women to wear what they like, Boris warned hijabs made them look like bank robbers or “letter boxes”.As with much of the ridicule hurled at Boris since Brexit, this was calculated to undermine his chances of winning any future leadership battle. But the really good news this festive season is the panic beginning to grip those who want to reverse the  referendum and keep Britain in Europe at any cost.Project Fear has become Project Farce. Fanatical Remoaners, not Brexiteeers, can be seen as the real swivel-eyed loonies.Time is running out — and it isn’t on their side. Either they accept Mrs May’s dodgy deal by March  or we’re OUT. As Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom explains, MPs cannot block Brexit.Far from being frightened off, foreign firms are pouring cash into UKplc. Savvy tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon have bet billions on post-Brexit Britain.  More firms are setting up HQs in London than any other EU capital and Britain has been voted the best country in the world to do business.We have just marked the wintry Shortest Day, a symbolic turning point, with the best jobs record in jobless Europe while the Eurozone faces an economic disaster. We are a long way short of high summer.But every day from now until the end of daylight- saving in March, things should get brighter and brighter. Have a wonderful Christmas and a terric New Year.AND finally, the best news of all. Ex-Chancellor George Osborne was filleted live on Saturday’s Today programme by BBC veteran David Dimbleby.Perhaps expecting an easy ride from a fellow Remainer, Georgie Boy was accused of cutting and running after the  referendum – and using his Treasury job to feather his nest.Comparing Osborne to greedy ex-PM Tony Blair, Dimbleby asked: “Why are you following in his foot-steps by taking job after job and earning millions of pounds a year  You became prominent because you were Chancellor.It’s as though going into politics – which you aban-doned when it turned against you – was a pathway to what you do now, making a buck.”The sound of spluttering could be heard.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nine minutes und kounting!”Here in Brexit-crazed Westminster, that scene sounds all too familiar.There are now fewer than  days until we are scheduled to leave the European Union on March .As European Commission bigshots like to say: “The clock is ticking.”Heaven knows what is going to happen: Will British Prime Minister Theresa May — still alive, and even a little stronger than she was a couple of weeks ago — elicit assurances from Brussels that will help her sell her Withdrawal Agreement deal to a sceptical House of Commons Will pro-Remain MPs somehow force a second referendum that could stop Brexit  Will we sail out of the EU without a treaty The only thing anyone knows for sure is that this particular thriller must soon end.By March , we will knowthe villain has succeeded in his dastardly plot or  can again save the world.Because, let’s face it, we’re not going to let the baddie win.Pessimists tend to prosper in uncertain times, and British politics at present is very much a catastrophists’ market.Critics and doomsayers are agitating more noisily as the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal becomes more likely.We’re being told British shops will run out of food and medicines, aeroplanes will be grounded and the economy could shrink by as much as eight per cent that’s the Bank of England’s worst-case scenariowe leave the EU without a deal in place.Officials in both London and Brussels are talking publicly about contingency planning, while Labour and pro-EU Tory MPs have repeatedly pressed May to rule it out.In the last Cabinet meeting of the year, Work And Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd supposedly compared Brexit to a car crash and Justice Secretary David Gauke said the concept of a “managed no-deal” was as mythical as a unicorn.But doomsayers should hold their fire — Britain will be just fine.Evensome instability does follow a no-treaty withdrawal, it would be short-term. Le would continue. Chickens would continue to lay eggs.Trading restrictions work both ways, so any attempt by Brussels to punish the disobedient Brits by preventing them exporting agricultural goods to the EU might encourage the British government to find sudden reasons to stop the importation of German motor cars. Or Irish beef. Or French wine.Have you tried new-world merlots  They can be rather good. And good value.No-deal would, in fact, have tremendous advantages.It would allow Britain immediately to negotiate and sign trade deals beyond Europe.It would force May’s government to cut taxes to make us more competitive.It would result in a tremendous boost to national unity.Before the EU starts feeling too sorry for us — or too eager to see the back of us — it might consider that in the long term, it has far greater problems on the horizon than we do.When none of the doomsday Brexit predictions comes to pass, the EU will find itself in deep trouble — our survival, and success without the bloc, will highlight the intransigence of the Commission and may well tempt other EU members to contemplate quitting the troubled union.Because there’s no denying it is deeply troubled.Belgium’s government is in turmoil — yet again.France’s peacock president is having his feathers plucked by a bolshy populace.The German chancellor is soon to depart this political le.Italy and Brussels may have papered over their rancorous dispute over Rome’s spending proposals, but neither is likely to play nice for long.Spain has a hideous unemployment problem and poor Greece, the crucible of Western democracy, has lost control of its own affairs and is turning into a Third World country.Poland and Hungary, of course, are pursuing non-liberal policies that have earned them the contempt of the European institutions.And all this before we even start contemplating Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s hiccups.Britain’s political class may be in agony over a “Leave” instruction it resents, but the country’s electorate is markedly more relaxed.January and February  are likely to prove noisy in Westminster, but by the end of March — one way or another — we will be out.That James Bond countdown will end and our ab-dabs will start to abate.The EU’s nightmare, alas, will continue.The question in Britain will then not be “why did we leave ” but “why did it take us so long ”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And, without our cash, the EU now realises there will be a massive black hole in their coffers.EU chiefs mistakenly thought they had us over a barrel and could use their leverage to get whatever they wanted.But they are now waking up to the fact that Theresa May’s Brexit deal is unlikely to get the nod and, with no deal legally our default position, a clean break looms.The refusal to give our PM any concessions does not look so wise now.The Sun has long questionedthe EU would ever prioritise their economies and citizens’ jobs over a zealous desire to punish Britain for leaving.Perhaps Mr Oettinger’s comments suggest that reality is finally dawning.IT is shocking that Britain has just TWO boats to police , miles of shoreline.Organised gangs are taking advantage of our easily penetrable coast to traffick desperate people who will risk their lives in one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes to get here.As many as  people have tried to cross over from France in just two months. How many more have slipped in under the radar If these people aren’t discouraged from taking such lethal risks then Britain’s beaches and ports will become as tempting as those in Spain and Italy.Our Government must stop more arriving.

President Macron must not allow Calais to be turned into another giant Jungle camp.Otherwise there will be needless blood on all of our hands.THE Sun’s Keep it Down campaign, launched in  to freeze fuel duty, has succeeded in putting an extra £billion into consumers’ pockets. Good.Without it, petrol prices could have risen to a shocking £. a litre. But away from the petrol pumps, motorists are still getting a raw deal.Over half a million potholes were reported last year.

This should go to the UN Security Council now. It’s not just Nazanin, there are many Britons and Americans being held by Iran.“We should also raise it to the level of a formal dispute between Britain and Iran, which hasn’t happened yet. That would give Nazanin diplomatic protection.”Mr Hunt stepped up the verbal pressure on Tehran yesterday by branding its actions as “monstrous” and “totally unjust”.He also accused Iran of holding Brits like Nazanin prisoner as “a tool of diplomatic leverage”.The Foreign Secretary added: “Iran is a country which has a great civilisation behind it, one of the oldest civilisations in the world, they want to be respected by other countries - this is not the way to do it, to imprison an innocent woman like this”.The Government has previously insisted international sanctions on Iran’s defence ministry made it impossible for a deal to be done.But campaigners have insisted it could instead pay Iran’s central bank the money, which has already been set aside in a holding account.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For me, after saving the boys, this is the icing on the cake.”Mr Jewell, , from Cheddar, Somerset, ing officer at the British Cave Rescue Council , praised the “amazing support” they had during and after the rescue.He said: “People from all over the country and the world have reached out to us to offer congratulations and express their gratitude.“Behind every one of the cave ers being honoured is a supporting cast of family, friends, rescue volunteers and employers.”Mr Bratchley, , a Met Office meteorologist based at RAF Valley, in Anglesey, North Wales, said it was “incredible to be recognised in such a way”.He said: “We’d like to sincerely thank everyone who helped us in any capacity and make it clear that such a rescue could never work otherwise - the ing was just the tip of a very large iceberg.”The British ers answered a call by Thai authorities to join a major search after the group disappeared in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave, in Chiang Rai province, on June .THE Whitehall mandarin whose department was at the centre of the John Worboys parole fiasco has been given the fourth most senior Order of Chivalry.Richard Heaton, Ministry of Justice permanent secretary, will get the Order of the Bath.His department oversees the Parole  Board, whose decision to free black cab rapist Worboys was reversed only after a Sun-backed legal challenge.One victim said yesterday: “The decision to release Worboys happened very much on his watch.”HMRC chief executive Jon Thompson also gets the Order of the Bath.Aged between  and ,they entered the caves and became marooned in the dark until Mr Stanton, , from Coventry, and Mr Volanthen, , from Bristol, reached them on July .Seven Royal Thai Navy Seals and a medic gave the youngsters ing lessons in the cave while authorities decided whether to wait for conditions to improve or bring the boys out straight away.Both were fraught with danger and one former navy Seal helping in the rescue effort died from a lack of oxygen during his mission.It was eventually decided to guide the boys out through nearly a mile of flooded caverns and tight passages where they emerged on July  - after  days underground.The four ers are among  recipients of bravery awards announced at the same time as the main honours list.They include seven firefighters who saved elderly residents from a serious blaze at a care home in Cheshunt in .Wayne Ansell, Simon Best, Daniel Cooper, Ricky Davis, Christopher Meadows, Radoslaw Przemyslaw Pejka and Simon Waddingham, all of Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, get Queen’s Gallantry Medals in recognition of their acts.And a Queen’s Commendation for Bravery also goes to -year-old Joe Rowlands, from Cheshire, whose sustained efforts saved his father Paul from drowning after their kayak capsized off Anglesey.THERESA May was  accused of handing out honours in a “shameless” bid to “blunt criticism” of her Brexit deal.It came as arch-Brexiteer John Redwood received his knighthood in the New Year’s Honours List.He was among three MPs given the accolade alongside former Tory minister Gary Streeter, who is already backing the PM’s deal, and Labour’s deputy chief whip Alan Campbell.Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said: “I cannot see how it is anything but a desperate attempt to blunt criticism of the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal.”But it appears Mr Redwood will not be swayed.He posted a blog just before the announcement of his honour titled “Eight things wrong with the Withdrawal Agreement”.The PM’s appointment of three Conservative MPs to the Privy Council was also branded a “desperate” attempt by the Government to shore up support for her deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every word of his tweet was correct — these men are sick, they are paedophiles and they are Asian.When politicians are condemned for telling the truth, for stating plain-as-day facts, you know we live in scarily censorious times.So, this week, Javid was right to turn down an invitation to “rethink” his October tweet.He was on the Today programme on Radio . A guest presenter — the British-Pakistani novelist Kamila Shamsie — asked himhe thought his tweet might have fuelled hate crimes. Coolly, and with rare principle, Javid said that of course politicians must be “careful with their language”.Butyou look at recent high-profile cases of gang-based sexual exploitation, “there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, he said.He’s right.Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale, Derby, Telford, Newcastle, Huddersfield . . . across England there have been awful grooming-gang cases, where the perpetrators have largely been Muslim men and the victims white working-class girls.We must be free to talk about this. To analyse it. To ask how such a terrible situation came about where vulnerable, mostly white girls are preyed upon by wicked, mainly Muslim men.But we are not free to talk about it. Anybody who raises the issue of Muslim grooming gangs risks being branded as foul, a racist, a troublemaker whose words will fuel hate crimes.Indeed, Javid has been subjected to genuine racist abuse for speaking out on the issue.Vile, hard-left tweeters have denounced him as an “Uncle Tom” and a “coconut”.Such disgusting racist insults reveal where the real prejudice lies in this debate — not in Javid’s concerned comments, but in the PC outrage that effectively says to him: “Shut up, Coconut.” Javid was not being prejudiced but many of the supposed progressives raging against him have been.It is all a sign of the times. From Conservatives such as Javid, to Labour MP Sarah Champion and radical feminists such as Julie Bindel, anyone who expresses concern about Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs can expect to be bombarded with abuse.But a nation that cannot discuss its communal tensions is a nation that is in very serious trouble.That signicant numbers of Muslim men are abusing signicant numbers of white working-class girls suggests “multicultural Britain” is a fractured, sometimes ugly place — and we must be at liberty to talk about this.Shushing debate about Muslim grooming gangs is insulting not only to the victims of those gangs, but to Britain’s Muslim community, too.It suggests they are too fragile, too weak, to cope with honest debate about problems and crimes within their communities.So let us be thankful for Sajid Javid — a politician who is willing to look modern Britain in the face and ask it some dficult but essential questions.This is a Tory to watch.Their latest wheeze is to force restaurants and supermarkets to impose “calorie caps” on their dishes.Public Health England is thinking about stopping supermarkets from selling sarnies that have more than  calories and capping restaurant meals at  calories. This would effectively mean using the power of the state to force us slovenly, greedy plebs to go on diets.It’s so paternalistic.Here’s a radical idea – bugger off and let people eat whatever they want.Our lunchtime triple-decker sandwich and occasional restaurant blowout are none of your business.TALK about a self-fulfilling prophecy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

bringing the state to a standstill.The drastic step is proposed as a way of forcing Theresa May to carry out a dramatic U-turn and back a rerun of the  vote.Pro-EU campaign group Best for Britain has published a new report recommending the wrecking tactic.It suggests MPs should vote down the PMs deal next month, then vote to rule out a No Deal outcome.The document says: The clearest opportunity for replacing no deal as the default option is through political pressure via the Finance Bill.The key point is that income tax and corporation tax are annual taxes, authorisation of which runs out at the end of the tax year.MPs could in theory pass an amendment blocking the Government from collecting the levies, which make up a third of all tax revenue.The proposed amendment to the Finance Bill would state that no taxes can be collected until the PM calls a second referendum on Brexit.It would be up to Speaker John Bercow to decide whether or not the amendment can be voted on.Another suggestion would see MPs block the Government from bringing any bills to the Commons unless ministers cave on Brexit.The report, drawn up with the help of lawyer and ex-MP David Howarth, lays out four options for Parliament to take control of the process.In a foreword Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve said: There are routes not yet properly explored, examined or voted upon which the Prime Minister appears to be attempting to close off.Instead Downing Street threatens a catastrophic No Deal should the Prime Minister’s deal fail to be delivered through Parliament.As parliamentarians, we have a duty to examine every option open to us which would avoid such an outcome.”Mrs Mays deal will go to a vote in Parliament in mid-January - but the PM needs to win over dozens more MPsshe is to avoid a humiliating defeat.If the Government loses, Britain will be on course to leave the EU without a deal, but MPs are likely to put pressure on Mrs May to hold a second referendum instead.She has always insisted thats out of the question, but earlier this month ally Amber Rudd suggested it would be better than a No Deal outcome."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000294946517.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"clock change eu british summer time brexit","story":"The EU has dictated that all European countries should stay on a single time zone all year round.And the UK is likely to follow suit -

One senior aide to the Prime Minister told the Mirror the eurocrat was the UK’s “best hope” of reaching agreement with the EU, conceding that he was “put on this earth to negotiate”. The Government is now hoping to get other EU leaders to sign up to a start date for the UK’s trading relationship with the bloc which could mean the controversial Irish border back stop could be avoided. They believe this could be done without reopening the orce deal, which Brussels has ruled out, but could nevertheless carry the legal force demanded by the PM’s Brexiteer critics.  Donald Tusk, the influential European Council President, will also play a key role in whether sceptical EU states can be persuaded to offer more. Britain’s focus is now on pushing for enough assurances from Brussels to get the Democratic Unionist Party, who the Tories rely on to prop up their fragile Government, on board, in the hope sceptical Tories will follow. However, the senior No  insider admitted that Mr Juncker and Mr Tusk have their work cut out in winning over the likes of French president Emmanuel Macron and Irish premier Leo Varadkhar. They conceded that December’s Brussels summit could have gone better, with Mr Juncker describing the PM’s Brexit plans as “nebulous and imprecise ” and Mrs May leaving virtually empty handed. “A lot of this will come down to Juncker and how much he wants to get a Brexit deal. He was put on this earth to negotiate. We hope that he’ll be able to help us get what we need to get the DUP on board,” the source said.  Other government insiders claimed that talks just before Christmas with the DUP had been more promising than before, when the party firmly ruled out backing Mrs May’s deal. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday warned that the EU must provide further assurances over the backstop, the fall-back plan for the border,the PM’s deal is to make it through Parliament. He told the BBC the backstop was the only “outstanding issue” and he believed it could be solved, noting that the EU had already agreed it was temporary. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK. The Future FrameworkComprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - not exactly the frictionless trade hoped for Possible EU access to British fishing waters We would remain tied to European courts Wed respect human rights laws Visas needed for long term trips to the EU It has built in vagueness - kicking the can down the road for further negotiationsRead about the deal in more depth here. “I think MPs, as they reflect on how close we are to an agreement, but also how cataclysmic it would bewe didn’t end up having an agreement we could get through Parliament, the best thing is to put our heads down and make sure we have a version of this agreement we can get through Parliament,” he said. His remarks came as Jeremy Corbyn urged the PM to cut the Christmas recess short and recall Parliament so MPs can vote on the Brexit deal. Meanwhile, Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez sought to reassure the , British retirees living in his country that their rights would remain unchanged eventhe UK crashes out of the EU without a deal.

And a cronyism row is set to brew after Theresa May rewarded big business chiefs who just happen to back her Brexit deal. There are plenty of famous faces in the honours list - but far more people who quietly work away at doing good for their communities. So to honour them all, we’ve reproduced the list in full - and highlights - below.  Overall, , recipients are named in the  New Year list. That includes the  people recognised for their acts responding to the terror attacks in Manchester and London in . Some  women are recognised in the list, representing % of the total, the lowest percentage since . Overall % of those being honoured come from a black, Asian and minority ethnic background, % consider themselves disabled and % identy as LGBT. Youth magazine founder Saeed Atcha, , is the youngest to be recognised, with an MBE for services to young people and the community in Greater Manchester. The oldest is -year-old World War Two veteran Robert Lingwood, who gets a BEM for services to the community in County Tyrone. The heroes in the community   people who responded to the Manchester and London terror attacks have been named in the New Year Honours. Among them is Special Sergeant Jared Simpson, one of the first officers on the scene at the Manchester Arena on the night of  May last year. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi had just detonated a homemade device laden with shrapnel in the lobby of the Arena at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, killing  people, the youngest just eight years old. “My first thought is always for the victim or victims that have been affected by whatever I am dealing with, and they will always be my first priority,” Sgt Simpson said, after learning of his British Empire Medal for services to policing. Other honours include an OBE for Paul Woodrow, Director of Operations at the London Ambulance Service an OBE for Joy Ongcachuy, a theatre nurse at Barts Hospital and a BEM for Theresa Lam, the Family Liaison Lead for Greater Manchester Police. British ers who helped save a youth football team trapped inside a flooded cave in Thailand are also honoured.   Vernon Unsworth, the ex-pat suing Tesla entrepreneur Elon Musk for labelling him a pedo guy, is among those getting MBEs for their roles in the dramatic Thai cave rescue, which gripped the world during the summer.

No awards will go to anyone involved in Grenfell Tower relief work until the public inquiry has concluded following talks with emergency services and community groups, organisers said. The sports stars  In sport, England football captain Harry Kane gets an MBE while national team manager Gareth Southgate gets an OBE, both for services to football and in recognition of Englands semi-final run at the  World Cup.

Motor neurone disease sufferer and former Scottish rugby player George Doddie Weir gets an OBE for services to rugby, motor neurone disease research, and the community in the Scottish Borders. The political cronyism   Theresa May was embroiled in a cronyism row last night after she announced that a prominent Brexiteer had been made a privy counsellor ahead of her meaningful vote on Brexit. Sir Edward Leigh, who has yet to announce how he will vote on the deal, said earlier this month that the Prime Minister’s efforts to secure concessions from Brussels could yet pay off. Two other Tory MPs who have both said they will back the Prime Minister’s plans were also appointed to the secretive official body - Philip Dunne and Sir Roger Gale. It came after hardline Brexiteer John Redwood - one of the Eurosceptic Cabinet ministers branded “bastards” by John Major - was knighted in the New Year’s Honours list. With the crunch vote due next month, speculation has been swirling at Westminster honours may be deployed as a means of luring MPs to back the Prime Minister. In an apparent bid to reassure supporters that he will not be swayed by his gong, Mr Redwood published a blog just days ahead of the announcement outlining “Eight things wrong with the withdrawal agreement”. Tory MP Gary Streeter, who backed Remain in the  referendum and has already made clear that he will support the PM, also received a knighthood. Tory donor John H J Lewis, who has given thousands of pounds to the party, was awarded an OBE for philanthropt and supporting the arts. Airbus UK chief Katherine Bennett, whose company had warned it might reconsider its investment in the UK in light of Brexit, but has now offered cautious support for the PM’s plan, gets an OBE.

The -year-old told the Press Association: Its wonderful, but it makes me giggle. When we wake up every morning we turn to each other, my husbandand I, and we just giggle. So its a very nice, warm feeling, and obviously I am very honoured. The hardest thing has been keeping it a secret, because weve known for about three-and-a-half weeks. Christopher Nolan  ChristopherNolanis one of the most acclaimed filmmakers of the st century and among the highest grossing directors of all-time. His work on the Dark Knight trilogy as well as movies including The Prestige, Inception and Dunkirk brought him blockbuster success as well as an Oscar nomination. Now, the -year-old can add a CBE to his already illustrious CV after being recognised for services to film in the New Year Honours. In a  interview with ,Nolan, who holds dual UK and US nationality, lamented the lack of support he received in the country of his birth while trying to break through in the film industry, reflecting: But theres a very limited pool of finance in the UK. To be honest, its a very clubby kind of place. In Hollywood theres a great openness, almost a voracious appetite for new people. Michael Palin   The former Monty Python star, who gets a knighthood in the Diplomatic Service and Overseas list for his international contributions to travel, culture and geography, said news of the accolade had not sunk in yet. He said: I dont think it will be until I see the envelopes addressing me as Sir Michael Palin. I have been a knight before, in Python films. I have been several knights including Sir Galahad and the knight who said, ni. He added: I am so very pleased that I was able to sort of morph from being Python and becoming a traveller, or a presenter of travel programmes. That gave me the chance to see an enormous amount of the world. Margaret Atwood  Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood, author of the feminist dystopian work The Handmaids Tale, becomes a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour for services to literature. She is alone this time round in receiving the highest honour it is possible to bestow in the New Year list. Philip Pullman The creator of the hugely successful His Dark Materials trilogy said he was very surprised and honoured to receive a knighthood for services to literature. He added: Im most grateful of all to those who continue to read my books, and I hope they dont have to work as hard as those who edit them. Jim Carter Carter, who played Mr Carson in the hit British period drama Downton Abbey, said he was delighted his OBE for services to drama came in time to be seen by his -year-old mother, who lit up at the good news. He added: Im hoping for a  of good news and kindness. It seems perilous times and it would be good to get a bit of kindness, sanity and good cheer back into the world.

The video has emerged as crowds of supporters have turned out for the annual Boxing Day hunts across the UK. The footage was allegedly filmed in Devon and has caused many to call on the government to strengthen legislation banning hunting with hounds.Devon County Hunt Saboteurs say the footage was captured during the Eggesford Hunt at Place Farm, on the edge of Okehampton, according to DevonLive. A spokesman said: When our sab team arrived the fox was barely alive, with its guts hanging out, and died in the arms of a young female saboteur.  A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said: Today we have been made aware of an incident near Okehampton on Boxing Day involving allegations of offences against the Hunting Act. The matter is being investigated and police would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident. We would encourage witnesses to any offences to share unedited footage and images with us, and to be prepared to give statements to allow us to investigate any allegation of criminality. We are aware of the sensitivities and the high-emotions that are linked to these incidents. All allegations connected with hunts are assessed and investigated appropriately and we work with our communities who have an interest in hunt activity as part of routine policing. We wish to reassure the public that we will act impartially and promptly to any incident reported to us, and would urge anyone with relevant information to contact Devon and Cornwall Police via . Ahead of the hunts, shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said an incoming Labour government would review penalties under the Hunting Act  to ensure it is an effective deterrent. It would include a consultation on the introduction of custodial sentences, bringing it in line with the penalties for other wildle crimes.  Ms Hayman said they would also consider measures to prevent the exploitation of loopholes in the legislation, which covers England and Wales. It could include the introduction of a new recklessness clause to prevent trail or drag hunts being used as cover for the illegal hunting of wild mammals. Ms Hayman said they would also look at removing an exemption for the use of dogs underground to protect game birds as it risks fights between hounds and wild animals. Labours  Hunting Act was a key milestone in banning this cruel blood sport, but since then new practices have developed to exploit loopholes in the legislation, she said. While Theresa May proposed scrapping the Hunting Act all together, Labour is today calling time on those who defy the law by announcing several measures that would clampdown on illegal hunting. Labour is the true party of animal welfare. These new proposals form part of the next chapter in striving to ensure our laws and regulations on animal welfare are up to date and fit for purpose. Grove and Rufford Hunt chairman Nick Alexander criticised Labours plans, saying there is more to prioritise in the world than beefing up hunting legislation.  He spoke as the hunt ed to Bawtry, near Doncaster in South Yorkshire, a year after it was refused permission to meet in the centre of the town following the convictions of three people for hunting offences. Of Labours plans he said: Its not welcome. It just seems a bit bizarre that theres lots of other things going on in the world at this time and,thats the priority, then someone needs to have a word. Standing among the crowds, he added: Look at all this. This is the real truth of the matter. Hunting is very much part of England - old England and modern England. And were here to stay.

So I’m not going to sell you a pup. It was bad. Thanks to the shambolic handling of Brexit,  was suffocated by a story that split the nation and made Britain a global laughing stock. But it wasn’t all bad. We had a glorious summer, the royals let a woman of colour into their ranks, North and South Korea agreed to formally end their war, Ireland repealed its abortion ban, England reached a World Cup shysemi-final and Trump didn’t blow up the planet. So here are my awards for ’s great, good and not-so good... Best joke  The Tories sent a campaign letter to an elderly couple, purportedly from Theresa May, addressed to “Mr Youmustbe F***ingjoking”. Banksy made a mockery of arts snobbery by shredding one of his paintings that had just sold for poundmillion. More people voted to put slab-headed footballer Harry Maguire riding a unicorn on a bank note than Margaret Thatcher. Nick Clegg, the man who did more to alienate schoolkids from politics by lying about tuition fees, was made a “sir”. But nothing had us rolling in the aisles more than the two Russian hitmen who poisoned the Skripals, claiming to have been in Salisbury because they were fascinated by the size of its cathedral spire. Best sight There was the auction of Nigel Farage’s National Portrait Gallery painting which failed to attract a single bid. There was Gareth Southgate’s waistcoat in Russia, which proved that mad dogs and Englishmen do go out in the C sun dressed for a wedding. There was the blimp of the US president flown above London during his UK visit which looked like Donald Trump impersonating Elvis Presley when he’d become so obese he couldn’t control his bowels. But on a personal level it has to be the closing credits of the abysmal corn-fest that was Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. Best Trump outburst  When asked to rate his presidential performance, the humble introvert replied: “I give myself an A-plus”. To howls of laughter he told the UN General Assembly that his administration had “accomplished more than almost any in the history of our country”. To much grimacing he told Kim Jong-un that he had a bigger nuclear button than him. But nothing summed up the ignorant racist philistine more than when he asked, during a discussion on visa limits for people from Haiti and Africa: “Why do we want people from all these sh**hole countries here  We should have more people from places like Norway.” Best quote  Tory peer Jeffrey Archer hopefully spoke for the nation when he said: “I’d vote for CorbynI lived in the North because half of what he says I find myself agreeing with %.” Tory MP Johnny Mercer definitely spoke for it when he called Theresa May’s Government a “sh**show”. But taking gold, despite being three years old, was David Cameron’s masterclass in irony before the  election, which was on most of our minds every day of the year: “Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice – stability and strong Government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.” How did that pan out  Best man  Those Thai cave rescuers showed magnicent ingenuity when they helped a trapped boys’ football team to safety. Raheem Sterling showed admirable courage, not just for taking on the racists at football grounds, but by kicking off a debate about how the media treats young black men. However, there could only be one winner: Danny Dyer, for calling out, live on TV, the architect of all of our misery, David Cameron: “How comes he can scuttle off  He called all this on. Where is he  Hes in Nice, with his trotters up. Tw*t.” Still makes me proud, that. Best woman  There was a big breakthrough in TV writers making us realise women could pen some of the funniest shows out there: Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls, Julia Davis’s SallyEver, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Killing Eve. Radio presenter Rachael Bland showed us all how to die with humour, dignity and courage when cancer claimed her, aged . But for giving the world a smile in a tough year I can’t look past porn star Stormy Daniels who claimed having sex with Donald Trump was the “least impressive” she’d had, mainly because his penis “has a huge mushroom head like a toadstool”. Worst man  James Dyson told us Brexit would liberate UK industry then announced his new electric car would be built in Singapore. David Davis resigned as Brexit Secretary after barely speaking to counterparts in Europe for two years then signed up for an after-dinner speaking agency. Tony Blair was never off the airwaves telling us about the disaster of Brexit to make us forget all about his disaster in Iraq. But the winner had to be the odious Boris Johnson, who whipped up hate with his burka letterbox jibe and resigned from a disastrous spell as foreign secretary to plot and lie his way to Number . Worst woman  Nadine Dorries told us it was “time for a charismatic figure like Tommy Robinson to be running the country”. Roseanne Barr finished her career when she tweeted that black businesswoman Valerie Jarrett was the product of a sex act between “Muslim brotherhood  planet of the apes”. And Jo Marney, the girlfriend of ex-UKIP leader Henry Bolton, spewed out Katie Hopkins-style tweets. But the winner is the most disloyal Labour MP in living memory. The one who has made a career being elected by working-class Labour voters of Vauxhall to represent shire voters who like hunting, DUP supporters and the Jacob Rees-Mogg tendency of the Tory Party: Kate Hoey.

Museum curator Shaun Kingsley said Its the largest collection of letters since people started to write to survive any shipwreck, anywhere in the world. It shouldnt have been preserved, but because there was no light, there was no oxygen, it was darkness, it was like putting a collection of organics in a tin can, sealing it up and putting it in a fridge freezer.

And the Duchess of Sussexs popularity may help her father-in-law Prince Charles when he comes to take the throne, it has been claimed. Leading Royal expert Phil Dampier believes the fab four of Meghan, Kate Middleton, Prince William and Prince Harry will help the public “tolerate Charles as King.  Charles, who turned  this year, is the longest serving heir-apparent to the crown in UK history. Referring to the public Mr Dampier, who has reported on the royal family for more than  years, told the : With the younger royals coming up behind you can see the future mapped out so I think they’re more than happy to tolerate Charles for the relatively short period he’s going to be king. “There’s a hard-core of people who don’t like Prince Charles and I don’t think anything’s going to change their mind, but I think most people respect him and do appreciate he’s been handed an extremely dficult talk.”  Prince Charles, born in November , has been next in line for the throne since his mother became Queen in February . He is also the longest serving Prince of Wales in history, having held the title since . Mr Dampier claimed Prince Charles is now happy with his situation.  He said: “There’s no doubt in my mind that he’s much happier and more contented now than he ever has been. “- years ago I think he was extremely impatient and frustrated by his role but marrying Camilla has definitely changed him and mellowed him. “I think he now just accepts that he’s going to have to wait until whenever it is and is fairly relaxed about that, whereas before I think he used to find it very frustrating.” Mr Dampier has travelled to more than  countries while reporting on the Royals, and has appeared on UK and international TV.

According to the paper, one high-ranking courtier was even amongst those to place a bet on the outcome.

For mums aged  to , one in five pregnancies results in twins. Its all in the hormones.

Many commented on the ambiguous clip with their opinion on the matter, with some even claiming that this could be the next Yanni or Laurel soundbite.  In the case of Yanny or Laurel, the reason for people being able to hear only one of the two names was said to be down to the frequency sensitivity of the iniduals ears.

State-run broadcaster RT sent the chocolate gts to members of the media and others claiming it reflected one of the biggest news stories of the year. Politicians in the city, where ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with Novichok in March, are said to be furious about the disrespectful gt. Salisbury MP John Glen said: This is bizarre behaviour but to be expected. A picture of the chocolate cathedral circulated online after Russian channel TV Dozhd, also known as TV rain, posted a picture of the edible gt on Twitter.  They thanked RT for the gt but said: Come for tea, were afraid to eat it alone. Salisbury councillor Jo Broom said the gt was in very poor taste. Its very regrettable that somebody would see fit to do something like this, and is quite disrespectful to those that were caught up in the incident. RT interviewed the two men believed to be responsible for poisoning the Skripals, named as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.  The men said they were tourists visiting the famous Salisbury Cathedral at the time of the near-fatal attack. They said friends had advised them to visit the monument and its m-tall spire but they decided not to ass there was muddy slush everywhere. Dawn Sturgess died in July after being exposed to Novichok when her boyfriend Charlie Rowley discovered a perfume bottle filled with the noxious substance.  An RT spokesperson said the chocolate model had been sent as a gt in the spirit of the Holiday Season to multiple friends, peers and partners in the media sphere and beyond. As a news organisation, every year we put together presents that reflect one or several of the biggest news stories of the year.

But as  dawns and its time to go back to school and work, the sagging branches are looking a bit sad and rooms are feeling just a bit too crammed full. Theres probably more pine needles on the floor than on the lower boughs, and that traditional Christmas tree smell has all but faded. You may have already taken them down, but the tradition, since the Victorian era, is to remove decorations on Twelfth Night. Every year this very tradition causes confusion, as people are left scratching their heads wondering when the date falls and why. Heres the answers and the date when you should take down your decorations. When is Twelfth Night   Depending on what youre celebrating its either January  or January  - and the last day you should keep festive decorations up. A day sooner or later is considered unlucky anddecorations are not removed on Twelfth Night then according to tradition they should stay up all year. Until the th century though, people would keep their decorations up until Candlemas Day on February . Twelfth Night falls on January  and Epiphany on January . Twelfth Night is so called because traditionally Christmas was a  day celebration, beginning on December . This can create some confusion as some will class January  as Twelfth Night because it is the th day after Christmas. Epiphany marks the end of Christmas when the Three Kings came to visit bearing gts, guided by the star which is now represented in the twinkling lights adorning our homes. Why is it unlucky   January  is observed as the last day of Christmas festivities - the eve of the Epiphany. In the past it was believed that tree-spirits lived in the greenery – such as holly and ivy – that people used to decorate their homes. While the festive season provided shelter for these spirits during the winter, they needed to be released outside once Christmas was over. If this custom wasn’t followed, greenery would notand vegetation would not grow as a result, causing agricultural and then food problems. Even though Christmas decorations are now less about foliage and more about baubles, glitter, tinsel and singing Santas, many people still adhere to the superstition. Do all countries follow this tradition   No. Because there is disagreement as to whether January  or January  is actually Twelfth Night lots of countries end up taking down their festooned trees at dferent times. This can also depend on when people actually celebrate the festive season - for example in Russia Christmas Day falls on January . But January  is officially the day of the Epiphany. This is from the Christian tradition where the faithful mark the birth of Jesus on December . The Maji didnt arrive until much later with their gtsso Christians mark this on January . Children were traditionally told thatyou took down your decorations before the Eve of the Epiphany, the wise men might not be able to find their way - because Christmas lights represent the Star of Bethlehem which guided them to Jesus. A number of countries in Europe follow the January  tradition, including the Germans, Poles and Czechs. However for some people, simply having the decorations up into the New Year is too much and many will be taking them down on the st of January.  Real Christmas trees will be accepted at most household tips, but local authorities, garden centres and community groups may accept them for recycling. Find out where might be suitable for this in your area.  If your decorations aren’t going into a loft or attic, make sure they’re stored in a watertight, plastic box - in fact, doing this wherever they are kept will protect them from damp and pests. It’s also worth wrapping fragile Christmas ornaments in tissue paper before storage - and, of course, coiling the lights in a neat circle round your arm. Obviously the loft fairies will have tangled them into a mess by next December, but at least you can say you tried when you open them in a frazzled temper next time.  The UK is estimated to use almost , tonnes of card packaging at Christmas, enough to make a cardboard motorway stretching from Birmingham to Lapland and back  times. Recycle Now is urging consumers to recycle this material rather than bin it. Shiny and metallic ieties of wrapping paper are not recyclable, so the campaign advises people to use the ‘scrunch test’ to check. If you scrunch the paper in your hand and it stays in a ball then it can by recycled but it can’tthe paper springs back. If youre recycling bin is full, several shops such as Marks and Spencer run card recycling schemes to raise funds for charity.

It was ‘who do you think it’s going to be  I’ve heard this or that’ and stuff like that.“I think with regards to the owners or the chairman, we don’t really see them that much on a day-to-day basis.“And the club has been running along smoothly, so it was not something we were speaking about too much.“There was a lot of talk about it in the week or so leading up to the takeover being confirmed last week, so it was mentioned but not all that much to be honest.”Now, though, Booth is keen to see just how much Minnesota-based Ogren is going to give manager Robbie Neilson to further strengthen the squad for the second half of the season.“January and the transfer window is coming and it will be interesting what happens, though it’s hard to say what will. We’ll get a view of the chairman’s ambition then and see what he does.“For us, Mike Martinwas a great guy but we didn’t see him too much and it will be the same with the new owner. We’ll talk about it a little bit but not too much and we just concentrate on the games coming up.”That focus on games made Booth well aware of the importance of United getting a win when Falkirk visited last Saturday.He believes the three points taken from that - victory were vital.“Obviously we’d not won in three games, so it was vital to get back to winning ways, especially at home.“Our last home performance against Ayr was disappointing, so it was huge to get the three points and I thought we played well and created a load of chances.“We probably should have been at least - up by the time injury time came and we gave away the penalty they scored from.“We were a bit slack for it and it meant the last few minutes were kind of ‘oh no’, but we managed to hold out pretty comfortably in the end and deserved the win.“It should have been dead and buried before that and I was really disappointed at not getting the clean sheet because we had defended really well during the game.“Overall, it was a good performance and a good win. We created good openings and we need to learn from that and put away more chances when we’re creating them like we did.”Booth also believes it was important United got back to imposing their passing game on teams again, just as they’d done in the draw at Inverness a week earlier.“That’s two good performances in a row. Four points from a home game against Falkirk and a trip to Inverness is not a bad .“We had a little dip and the Ayr United game took us by shock.“We didn’t really recover the week after down at Morton where it was a pretty poor performance but we feel back on track and long may it continue.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c23494787682.jpg ","title":"wasted emergency services spent a fortnight attending hoax calls","story":"Tayside#s emergency fire and ambulance crews have spent nearly a fortnight responding to hoax calls over the past four years, the Tele can reveal.Hundreds of calls have been made to both services which have led to a turn-out of staff, only for them to find it was malicious.Firefighters have spent more than , minutes – a total of  hours or more than  days – responding to such incidents since -.The majority of those calls involved fire alarms being activated deliberately, but they have also attended  reports about dangerous buildings, crashes and people in distress.In -, crews spent more time attending hoax calls than any of the previous two years, at more than , minutes.Between April and November this year, the figure stood at , minutes.Terry Whyte, local representative for the Fire Brigades Union , said crews are working hard to inform children about the implications of making   calls.He said: “The FBU has been working with the fire and rescue service to try to drive this down.“It’s down to education, such as going into schools and teaching kids about how important it is.“Our officers could be tied up with something  when there is a much more serious incident going on where.“We are constantly out speaking to kids about the dangers of making these kind of calls.“If there’s a specic area that we’re getting these calls from, then we’ll go out to it.“We certainly won’t be slowing down in trying to stop it happening for good.”Meanwhile, paramedics in Tayside have also been on the receiving end of malicious calls – most frequently in Dundee.Ambulance staff in the city have spent a total of , minutes responding to hoax calls since - – equal to about  hours, or more than two days. vw, px\"  And figures suggest that - is on track to be the worst year of the last four – with more than  minutes already spent on hoax incidents since April, more than the whole of - and just short of figures from - or -.Callers have ly reported patients having breathing problems, traumatic injuries, chest pains, burns, drowning and even stabbing or gunshot wounds, during their malicious calls.A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said: “Anyone who calls  without a genuine need is potentially putting lives at risk by tying up valuable resources that could be needed for a le-threatening call.“When appropriate, malicious or nuisance callers are reported to the police.“However, in many cases, the call is a result of a social issue rather than malice and the patient may still need assistance.“In these cases, the relevant agencies are advised so appropriate care can be provided.”A Scottish Government spokesman said: “We condemn hoax calls to our emergency services.

Once the ball goes inside Andy .“Sinclair starts in an offside position as most good forwards do and one or two of ours aren’t quick enough to deal with it.“We need to be tighter to him and I think with the third goal we were unlucky not to deal with the initial pass through.“Edouard gets the break, but what a finish to have the composure to lt it over Joe – you have to applaud that finish.“Even then the resilience was good.“We still thought we were in it and Lewis Ferguson scored then we didn’t get the point we maybe deserved when James Wilson put one over the bar after that.”Another disappointment for the Dons was Niall McGinn having to be replaced due to a groin strain at half-time.McInnes said: “Niall McGinn has to come off with a groin strain which is just down to accumulation of games.“Niall was doing well so we didn’t have our troubles to seek.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/SNS-18290136-Aberdeen-v-Celtic.jpg ","title":"wright calls on dons for final push to end year on a winner","story":"Scott Wright has called on the Dons to finish  with a win to keep pace with the teams above them at the top of the table.Aberdeen end the year against Livingston at the Tony Macaroni Arena tomorrow.The Reds had a run of four wins on the spin halted by Celtic on Boxing Day as the Hoops triumphed - in a thriller at Pittodrie.Defeat dropped Derek McInnes’ team to fourth in the Premiership. They are six points behind leaders Celtic, three behind Rangers in second and two behind Kilmarnock in third.With it being so tight at the top this season Wright wants Aberdeen to finish the year with a win to make sure they are in contention at the top going into January’s winter break and the second half of the season.With Rangers and Celtic facing each other at Ibrox tomorrow, a win for the Reds would see them gain ground on at least one of the Glasgow teams.Winger Wright said: “It’s important to get three points before the break.“With such a long time before our next game the manager will really want us to get three points and look to climb up the table again.“We know what they are like and the manager will structure a game plan for them after looking at the Celtic game.“It’s about taking the positives from Celtic and totally focusing on the weekend.“We are in the mix at the top of the table just now.“It has been a really tight league this year and we don’t want to be sitting looking saying ‘it’s good that it’s tight at the top’ and we’re not up there.“We want to be right in about it at the top of league and hopefully we can be. That does make it important to win against Livingston.“It’s a simple phrase, but all we can do is take things game by game and make sure we prepare right for the Livingston game.”Victory tomorrow in West Lothian would see Aberdeen finish  with a points total of  from their  league games.Wright believes that would be an adequateand the -year old added: “I think that was roughly where we were at this time of the season last season.“It is a case of taking it game by game.“We know we are a strong team and we have had quite a strong December.“We’re not going to take this game lightly just before the break.“We need to go into it and give % and I’m sure we will.”Wright was disappointed to lose to Celtic on Boxing Day after Brendan Rodgers’ team prevailed in an enthralling encounter.The game had been poised at - in the final  minutes but a couple of quickfire goals from Odsonne Edouard and Scott Sinclair meant Lewis Ferguson’s th-minute volley wasn’t enough for the Dons to take something.However, Wright believes they can take some positives and said: “It was a case of trying to really push and get at them and not a case of just sitting back and admiring that they are a good team.“We know they are a good team but we had to go and play to our strengths.“We had to see how that played out and it was just unfortunate how it panned out at the end of the game.“The gaffer was obviously disappointed with the result – but he was happy with how we played.“We stuck to his gameplan, it was unfortunate the way the game panned out.“But we’ll take positives from it and come in and work hard again for the last game before the break against Livingston.”Wright was a half-time sub for Aberdeen on Boxing Day.He replaced Niall McGinn at the break with the Northern Ireland international struggling with a groin strain. Wright his hoping to keep his place in the side for the last game of  against Livi.He said: “I definitely want to try to keep my place.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

When in a state of excitement and aggression, a dog may then choose to attack a human being, and we are into another ball game entirely.The solution seems simple # keep control of your dog at all times and have it on a lead around livestock.

For myself, it has two principal components.The first is light. Most societies had and have a celebration of light at the darkest time of the year. It is a pattern followed by most of the world#s great religions.The religious reference is not only to the physical darkness of the sun being below the equator, but also the psychological darkness caused by uncertainty, loss, suffering of the body or the mind, broken relationships and the brokenness of many lives.By allowing the light of Christ to shine into our lives and bring comfort, guidance, courage, strength, we can change direction, start again and have cause for celebration.The second aspect is of birth. It really does not matter where or when Jesus was born. As Paul writes: #Jesus was born of a woman#, as we all were. The birth of a child, the gt of le, with all the potential each child has to become fully themselves.Jesus#s birth was no more or no less important to Mary and toThis time of year gives us the opportunity to celebrate le and perhaps, as the years pass and we look back, to reflect on how we have used our gts and talents.Is the world a better place because I we have walked this way  Is the world a better place because the Christ has walked this way If you are together as family, be happy together. Le is too valuable to spoil a celebration. If you are alone, I trust there are folk around you who will share with you.Whoever you are, may the light and the love of Christ#s coming bless you as you journey.PIC:Reverend Dr Roderick Campbell. _aRevCampbellAs isional commander, I sincerely hope this very special time of year is one that is fun-filled, enjoyed by all, and everyone is kept safe.It’s also a time for reflection. For my own part, I’m amazed at how quickly the year has passed.  has been a satisfying year as our strong local partnerships with our local authorities and other service providers have been built on to ensure close collaboration as problems arose.This approach delivered on our shared priorities to enhance the lives of iniduals in need of our support, and continued to nurture a safe and thriving environment for inidual and community wellbeing.We have faced several signicant challenges, not least the ‘Beast from the East’ extreme winter that caused such disruption across the country.During this Year of Young People, I am proud that the ision has continued to lead the way in Police Scotland in our innovative deployment of Youth Engagement Officers. Their interactions with young people make many positive interventions in their lives. We’ve also continued to grow the number of our teams of active and enthusiastic Police Scotland Youth Volunteers.Police Scotland#s festive campaign provides useful advice regarding protecting you your home and property, and safety advice for shopping and using ATMs. Please check this on our social media pages.I hope you all enjoy the New Year and I encourage all to take care throughout the festive period.PIC:Chief Superintendent Hazel Hendren. _aHazelHendrenI am very glad to have the opportunity to wish everyone across Argyll and Bute all the very best for this festive season. Argyll is stunning in the summer months when the sun shines but even as the nights get longer and the days colder there is still so much to enjoy from our glittering winter landscapes to the warmth of our many whiskies.When I look back over the past  months at le in Argyll and Bute, there is one thing that really stands out – the tremendous sense of community spirit, pride and positivity that’s sweeping through our communities of late.We have our challenges to face – that’s inescapable. But over the past year in particular I’ve been so encouraged to see the determination of local people to rise above those challenges and make sure that local le is as vibrant and successful as possible.  We’re all spreading the word that Argyll and Bute really is a great place to live, work, visit and do business – all year round.Wherever you are in Argyll and Bute, I hope you enjoy the festive season and that  brings you what you need. A Happy New Year to you all.PIC:Councillor Aileen Morton. no_aAileen-MortonMay I begin by wishing each of you a peaceful New Year.I think it is important that we take a bit of time  out of time to appreciate what we have but also to think of those less fortunate than ourselves andpossible, resolve to do something that will make a dference to someone’s le this festive season.Shamefully, despite the United Kingdom being the sixth largest economy in the world, more and more of our friends, neighbours and colleagues here in Argyll and Bute will have to rely on food banks and charities to get them through the season.It beggars belief that in , increasing numbers of mums, dads, children, pensioners, those in low-paid work, people seeking work, those living with mental health issues or a disability, have gone hungry and more and more children had nothing to unwrap on Christmas morning.And without the generosity of the people of Argyll and Bute and the wonderful work being done by an army of volunteers, the situation would be so much worse. And each of us owes these volunteers a huge thank you for the work they do.So please,you can afford it, please donate a little something extra to your local food bank this week.As my dad would often say: #There, but for the grace of God, go I.#PIC:Brendan O#Hara MP. no_aBrendanOHaraLiving as we are through the most dficult and disturbing of times it is important for all of us # and especially politicians # to realise that there are more important things than partisan headlines, parliamentary debates and public disagreements.Family, health, the company of friends, our homes and the wonderful environment of Argyll and Bute that we are lucky enough to live in are all things which we should treasure and celebrate. Those who lack them or who through illness or loneliness or despair cannot, for a time, appreciate them need our special thoughts particularly during the festive season.As your local MSP, working alongside my constituency staff, I have tried to help all of those who have contacted me during the year for whatever reason. That is my first duty and I am glad to do it. We won’t always agree on everything but we can agree, I am sure, that by showing solidarity, mutual support and kindness we can find the best way to live together here in Argyll and Bute, in Scotland, across these islands, in Europe and globally.We cannot know what lies ahead and the uncertainty of Brexit casts a long shadow locally and nationally at present.

It all helps to add to the feeling that Christmas is a joyous time that should be filled with family, friends, fun and festivities.Christmas means a lot of dferent things to dferent people, and I hope that whatever is most important to you this festive season plays a big part in your celebrations.And once Christmas has come and gone, the New Year allows us all the chance to look forward to the next  months.I would encourage everyone to take a moment to think about those in our communities who may not find this time of year as much fun as others, for whatever reason.Happy New Year to you all.PIC:Provost Len Scoullar. no_aLenScoullar"},{"url":null,"title":"country christmas dance craic in ardrishaig","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Mid Argyll branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Societyheld its Christmas party dance in Ardrishaig Hall on Monday December .Visitors from Tarbert, Kilmelford and Strachur were welcomed and a great evening was had by everyone, dancing to the wonderful accordion music of Ian Muir.A delicious buffet supper was served in the interval and Santa took time out from his busy schedule to put in an appearance and distribute presents, much to the delight of the youngest dancer, two-year-old Erica McKee.The programme featured dances connected with one of the founders of the RSCDS, Ysobel Stewart, and MC Mike Murray entertained the audience between dances with snippets of information about Mrs Stewart#s le and connections with Argyll.Dancing resumes after the holidays on Monday January .

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward. The opening of the Lodge is one step in many that the board are currently working towards and we are looking forward to unveiling the other plans that we have been working on very soon.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this.

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

of Prestonpans to give them the best opportunities they can. I think in the long term it will be the best benefit for the people of Prestonpans.His view was given cross-party support at the council meeting, with fellow councillor Norman Hampshire saying that concerns about the merger were caused by ldquoa fear of the unknown.The new school is expected to be operational by February, with a Transition Action Group brought in to oversee any changes.Its name is still to be decided."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-700-celebrations-build-on-great-work","story":"Councillor John McMillan praised the efforts of the Haddington  team.Events have been held throughout the year to mark  years since the town received the Bruce Charter ndash the oldest document in the East Lothian Archives.The final event saw a concert held by Siobhan Miller at St Maryrsquos Parish Church last Thursday evening.Mr McMillan said: ldquoFor the children, in the Year of Young People, we finished on the John Knox and Robert the Bruce Lego event.ldquoIt was amazing and a great tribute to Ruth Fyfe and Frances Woodrow, the archivists at the John Gray Centre, who had the initial idea and have been at the heart of it all.

A number of surrendered German submarines were on display at both the Broomielaw and Kingston dock. So great was the press of people eager to inspect them that many had to be turned away.In Edinburgh, churches staged well-attended Christmas services at the Scottish General Military Hospital, Craigleith, where there were  patients, including  repatriated prisoners of war, the wards were gaily decorated, and each patient received a parcel containing tobacco, chocolate and other items.In Greenock, workers at the torpedo factory enjoyed a day off.

As Humanists we support iniduals living a loving le with those who make them happy.ldquoThere clearly continues to be work done to ensure Scotland is a fully inclusive nation for LGBT people.ldquoThe Scottish public have also shown their awareness of those who attempt to use religion as a tool for ision.ldquoOver three quarters said they felt some hard line religious people were too intolerant of others and believed in no way should religious leaders attempt to influence peoplersquos democratic votes.\"The survey found % of Scots said they had no qualms about the religion of their GP, with those over the age of  being the most accepting of dferent beliefs in the consulting room .A total of % of respondents said they would not accept someone from a dferent faith teaching their children.Elsewhere, % of Scots said religious leaders should not try and influence peoplersquos votes and % said they should not try to influence government decisions.Around % of respondents said they believed it was possible to live a good ethical le without being religious.More than , Scots were polled by Survation on their attitudes over the summer.Colin Macfarlane, director of Stonewall Scotland, said the findings confirmed the charityrsquos own research, and highlighted that ldquowhile progress has been made we cannot be complacent.He said: ldquoWe know that in Scotland one in five people have experienced a hate crime in the last year because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.ldquoWe know that only half of lesbian, gay, bi and trans people feel comfortable being open about their sexual orientation or gender identity with their family and two in five trans people avoid certain streets because they donrsquot feel safe.ldquoScotland has changed for the better over the course of the last  years but there is much more to be done before everyone is accepted without exception.A spokesman for the Catholic Church said the results ldquodo appear to show encouraging levels of tolerance.He added: ldquoBut it is important to remember that tolerating is not the same as agreeing.ldquoWhile we should encourage tolerance, compelling people to agree with or endorse what they oppose, would be the height of intolerance.A Church of Scotland spokesman said the report highlighted ldquoa tolerant and inclusive society.He added: ldquoHowever, it also shows that more work remains to be done.ldquoThe Church of Scotland works continuously to nurture good relationships with people of all faiths and none.He said the church was ldquoalways willing to try to work to heal isions and improve understanding."},{"url":null,"title":"administrators-appointed-as-hmv-becomes-latest-high-street-casualty","story":"The business will continue to trade while options are explored, including a potential sale, KPMG said.It is the second time HMV has collapsed in recent years, having filed for administration in , after which it was acquired by its current owner, Hilco.The company operates from nearly  stores across the UK ndash including nine Fopp stores ndash and employs , permanent staff.The appointment of administrators was confirmed following a hearing before a High Court judge on Friday evening.Will Wright, partner at KPMG and joint administrator, said: ldquoWhilst we understand that it has continued to outperform the overall market decline in physical music and visual sales, as well as growing a profitable ecommerce business, the company has suffered from the ongoing wave of digital disruption sweeping across the entertainment industry.ldquoThis has been in addition to the ongoing pressures facing many high street retailers, including weakening consumer confidence, rising costs and business rates pressures.ldquoOver the coming weeks, we will endeavour to continue to operate all stores as a going concern while we assess options for the business, including a possible sale.ldquoCustomers with gt cards are advised that the cards will be honoured as usual, while the business continues to trade.Speaking on Friday, Paul McGowan, executive chairman of HMV and Hilco, said: ldquoDuring the key Christmas trading period the market for DVD fell by over % compared to the previous year and, whilst HMV performed considerably better than that, such a deterioration in a key sector of the market is unsustainable.ldquoHMV has clearly not been insulated from the general malaise of the UK high street and has suffered the same challenges with business rates and other government-centric policies which have led to increased fixed costs in the business.ldquoBusiness rates alone represent an annual cost to HMV in excess of pound million.

Irsquove always since been fortied by the Almightyrsquos endorsement of getting occasionally howling with the drink, especiallyitrsquos in a good causeand for the spreading of good cheer.Some Christians I know tend to chafe and get overly defensive when vile atheists make fun of some of our practices. They are keen to stress their saviourrsquos status as both God and Human and yet curiously never to entertain the concept that He had a sense of humour ... or that being both God and Man He actually created humour.Jesus spent the three years of his public ministry upsetting the religious authorities and giving them a hard time. Itrsquos not dficult to imagine Him in a Galilee tavern favoured by fishermen with his apostles and Mary Magdalene and the other women who followed him having a few drinks and a laugh at the efforts of some of the local Sanhedrin to silence Him. ldquoVerily, like herding cats, cats and thrice cats, as a top Pharisees was reported to have said in one of the Dead Sea Scrolls that never made it.Thus I was initially entertained by reports that our Prime Minister, Theresa May, who claims to be a woman of profound Christian faith, seems also to possess a sense of humour where The Lord is concerned. Mrs May regularly attends St Andrews Anglican church in Sonning, Hertfordshire by the Thames, a place once described by Jerome K Jerome as ldquothe most fairy-like little nook on the whole river. Social deprivation and inequality exist on a dferent planet to this place.Commendably, Mrs May has never equivocated about her Christian faith. ldquoIve been clear and everybody knows that faith plays a part in my le and faith guides me in everything I do. The Church does so much and it is an integral part of our society but it also does a lot of work overseas and that is important too. It was probably this which lay behind her Governmentrsquos decision to conduct a review into the persecution suffered by Christians around the globe but principally in the Middle East where the faith is currently at risk of being wiped out of the region of its birth.Irsquom in no position to doubt Mrs Mayrsquos sincerity and at least she doesnrsquot wield her faith like a sword of righteousness to justy war and acts of military aggression. Nor does she suffer from Americarsquos great Christian delusion which requires every inhabitant of the White House to profess Christianity while laying waste to entire cultures and torturing their enemies while allowing their richest corporate beasts to make fortunes in the wake.Indeed the Prime Minister possesses more sincerity about her faith than Tony Blair, one of her predecessors at Number Ten. Mr Blairrsquos faith, you sensed was a watery and featureless thing which blew with the winds of any prevailing social orthodoxy. It was glimpsed when he felt there were votes to be won with it and concealed when he sensed it was a vote-loser. Rather, Mrs Mayrsquos version of Christianity seems to be made of sterner stuff and helped her deal with the trauma of losing both her parents while she was in her mid-s, and the realisation that she could not have children.Yet, while taking care not to mock our premierrsquos faith you do find yourself hoping that one of the BBCrsquos house-trained political staff might ask her about the parables of the widowrsquos mite or the storming of the temple or the eye of the needle the next time she claims justication by faith. No-onersquos suggesting here that Tories and affluent people will be judged more harshly than the rest of us, just that there is a golden thread of social justice running through the teachings of Christ which seems to be profoundly at odds with current Conservative and Unionist social policy. The human consequences of some of her Governmentrsquos social policies are inescapable even for someone who lives with a multi-millionaire hedge fund operator on ldquothe most fairy-like little nook on the entire river.Actively using your Governmentrsquos political advantages to penalise the most vulnerable in our society is unforgivable at any time. To do so while granting tax advantages ndash yet again ndash to those who can easily do without them is simply wicked. Deliberately to exacerbate the suffering of women who have become pregnant as the result of rape by making them dance for a little extra money is obscene. To give credence to the lie that we need Brexit to stop foreigners taking our jobs and leeching from us is not only evil ndash itrsquos highly dangerous. Some might even say that any social disorder ensuing from Brexit and resulting in martial law being imposed is exactly the historic opportunity for which some of Mrs Mayrsquos adherents have been waiting for several generations. They are sure to channel their inner Joabs.Conservative ideology on either side of the Atlantic has leaned heavily on Pentecostalism and Evangelicalism to disguise many of the seven deadly sins of reactionary corporate governance. Pride, Gluttony and Greed are the main totems of Mrs Mayrsquos administration. No one, though, could accuse it of Sloth when exploiting the suffering of others.In an ideal world the UKrsquos main Christian faiths ndash and especially the Catholic church ndash would be calling the Prime Minister to account for the way in which she casually deploys faith in times such as these. But when yoursquove lost your moral authority to speak owing to widespread, historic clerical sex abuse this is impossible.

They plan to do this by offsetting all the harmful emissions which are released into the atmosphere.But given an estimated .m people are expected to travel to the World Cup , can Qatar really pull off this promise And for all the appeal of major sporting events, is FIFA selling us short when it claims to promote environmental conservation FIFA insists on each event being assessed for the effectiveness of its greening activities before, during and afterwards, so on the surface, there should be no place to hide.For example, the Brazilian governmentrsquos initiative, Agenda for a Sustainable World Cup, saw sustainability as the neutralisation of carbon through the purchase of certicates issued by those who created the emissions.So the environmental damage associated with the construction of the Arena Pantanal Cuiaba was offset by a reforestation project on the banks of the River Pantanal.However, the gloomy lessons of history tell us that standards often slip.Qatar is widely credited with pulling off a minor miracle for its energy-saving cooling technology in stadiums, defeating criticism that players and spectators could not tolerate the nationrsquos extreme temperatures.More than  jet nozzles will blast out cold air, keeping temperatures at around  degrees Celsiusfor everyone inside.Chilled water is piped to the stadium from a cooling centre a mile away and once it arrives cold air is pushed out into the arena.Qatar claims this uses % less energy than other cooling methods. Other innovations include the showcasing of pavements that generate electricity and seating made out of recycled palm branches.The eight stadiums are within just a -mile radius of the capital, Doha, cutting down on travel time during the -day event.And at the end of the tournament, they have pledged to rebuild them in the developing world.The tiny Gulf nation is growing .million sq.metres of grass every year ndash enough to cover  football pitches ndash to make the areas around stadiums more fan-friendly.Along with  treesand thousands of shrubs, these are all being cultivated at a nursery farm irrigated by Doha North Sewage Treatment Works, which keeps two , sq m lagoons topped up.Qatarrsquos World Cup organisers, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, proudly trumpets its green credentials on its website.This includes a list of Sustainability Facts about Qatar  stadiums which include water conservation, energy-efficient LED lights and the demountable stadiums made out of shipping containers which will be donated to developing countries along with , seats.The question remains, however, whether theyrsquore able to pull it off. Certainly, there are sceptics who point to FIFArsquos carbon-offsetting scheme in Russia. A recent study suggested that only % of its emissions reductions were likely to deliver real results.If Infantino gets his wish to increase the  World Cup from  to  teams, then he also risks increasing the tournamentrsquos carbon footprint, as extra matches held in other countries will necessitate more air travel by players and fans.It is not enough to pay lip service to sustainability and conservation. The World Cup remains the most lucrative and costliest football event in the world, with FIFA raking in billions of dollars in revenue every four years.Construction and preparation for the  World Cup cost pound.bn for Russia, with most coming from public funding. Brazil spent to build pound.bn stadiums and transportation.For FIFA to truly deliver on the promises of its Green Goal project, it is crucial that tournaments factor sustainability into the planning, design and construction of tournaments from the outset, and involve both the private and public sector.We must all demand total transparency when it comes to measuring the impact of each tournament.With all its money and laudable goals, there are high hopes for Qatar.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present. Unless the Minister agrees to think again ahead of Stage  consideration of this bill, that situation is unlikely to change.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Incredibly, the pound target was smashed within days, hundreds of complete strangers inspired by his determination amongst the backers.Speaking to the Ross-shire Journal this week, he said: \"Since getting access to the best facilities and coaches, my performance has improved and Im getting personal bests. Cycling in front of a home crowd in London was just so much fun ndash the noise was ridiculous and I just didnt want to come off the track.\"He powered through the km four-lap race in m s, pipped by just a fraction of a second by the reigning world champion.Fin, who needs a leg brace to race, was quick to thank those who have shown faith in him, not least parents Dee and Drew who have backed his dream from the start and driven him thousands of miles around the country to compete. \"Without them, none of this would have happened,\" he said. \"They were able to come down to London to watch, which was very special.\"After being invited to talk to pupils at his former school, Fin said he shared his highs and lows and spoke of the importance of setting a target ndash even amidst setbacks such as his illness.A spokesman at Dingwall Academy said: \"Effort, resilience, embracing challenge, listening to feedback, never giving up and learning from failures were all great messages.\"His mum Dee, a childrens nurse, earlier told the Journal: \"We have no idea what the future holds.

And early, please. The trade secret is what is known in politics as the Christmas Box a folio of previously prepared stories from press teams under day-by-day embargo drip-fed to tide the papers over until proper news starts happening again.Without Christmas Boxes, the news agenda would just be a diet of the day’s emergencies, the aftermath of drunken violence and the Old Firm. A bit like BBC Scotland every weekend.This year it’s much, much easier. No-one, not the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the First Minister, the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Patriarch of Constantinople or Richard Dawkins has any idea what’s going to happen in British or European politics next week, never mind next year, so commentators can speculate away in the knowledge that reality will be crazier than any guess.My punt is the Prime Minister’s Draft Withdrawal Agreement for leaving the EU will win the day but onlyshe follows the advice to narrow down the options. There is no parliamentary majority for any of the possible pathways and despite talk of Norway or Canada Plus, it might as well be Norwegian Wood or Canada Dry for all the attention the EU is paying. The options come down to a second in-or-out referendum, the draft deal or a no-deal departure.As the government is committed to the meaningful vote by  January, the first move onfrom recess a week on Monday should be to force a vote over a second referendum. With Jeremy Corbyn committed to Brexit it’s a vote the government should win, which would leave the draft withdrawal and a no deal departure which the majority also oppose. Game, set and match, Mrs May.But having gambled with General Election odds in her favour and lost heavily, will Mrs May gamble again  With advice from the level-headed David Liddington, I’m not betting against it. VA envyEnterprising iniduals can make their own headlines, as Edinburgh Labour leader Cammy Day has done with his views on the Dundee VA and how Edinburgh should be following suit. What caught the eye, on Tayside certainly, was Cllr Day’s rejoinder that “ bloody Dundee can get a VA, then the capital city wants something even better”. Somewhat more diplomatically, bloody Dundee councillor Lynne Short responded calmly: “It is goodwe are inspiring other towns and cities.”Happily, now working on what could be Edinburgh’s answer to the VA is award-winning Scottish architect John McAslan whose catalogue of major international works includes London King’s Cross Station. Typically in his game there has been the odd political scuffle, most notably his shelved plans for Glasgow’s George Square.His practice has been working on the £m Granton collections centre for the National Galleries of Scotland and ever-helpful Cllr Day chipped in: “What we don’t want is a big storage container. We want a VA, we want something that’s quite iconic. If that’s not what’s coming forward then we are not interested.” “Quite iconic  How quite iconic would you like it, sir,” might not be Mr McAslan’s immediate reaction, but the point about a focal point for the new district is reasonable. I could hardly argue, given I made the same point in June after a sneak preview of the VA. “Siting anything like the VA in or around Edinburgh city centre would cause uproar, but put it on the seafront in Granton and it might have a similar effect as it’s having in Dundee,” I wrote. The problem with iconic, as the saga of the ten-times-over-budget £m Scottish Parliament building demonstrated, is cost. The Dundee VA is only about the same size as the Holyrood debating chamber alone and from £m ended up costing just over £m. Not quite iconicIconic is not a word often used to describe Meadowbank Stadium. Controversial or crumbling certainly, historic to an extent but symbolic not so much, not in architectural terms anyway.But the ious schemes to replace the Commonwealth Games complex have come to symbolise bitter cynicism about local decision-makingand a deep disenchantment with Edinburgh Council.For all its shortcomings, the stadium gave the district a sense of identity which the new sports centre will struggle to match.A new animated ‘fly-through’ of the replacement centre has just been released by the council, revealing a perfectly al regional sports centre, but to borrow from Cllr Day, it’s not quite iconic. Maybe the reality will be more impressive, but it doesn’t look like much for £m, certainly not the underwhelming -seat spectator area which is supposed to be a new home for Third Division high-flyers Edinburgh City.There is no sound business case for the council to build and maintain an international athletics stadium which would be needed about once every two years. If a millionaire track and field fan came forward then maybe it could be dferent, but the last time a supposed tycoon flashed his wallet around Meadowbank it didn’t end well. But the new images will do little to quell the feeling the area has been short-changed.Progress prediction nilNew Meadowbank is due to open in  and approximately  months later voters get a chance to pass judgment on their councillors at the  local elections. So in the spirit of all those Twixtmas space-fillers, here are a few predictions for Scotland’s capital in  after ten years of SNP-Labour coalitions: the Newhaven tram completion will not have taken its first fare-paying customer, the huge new Granton estate will not have risen from the old gasworks site, the South Suburban rail line’s only service will still be freight and the airport International Business Gateway will still be a field. ©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4849765.1546031054!/image/image.jpg","title":"customer service brexit queue jumpers and the weather britain s top moans","story":"Forgetting to take bags to the supermarket, endless Brexit negotiations and people staring at their mobile instead of watching where they are going feature on a list of Britain#s favourite moans.A poll of , adults found the top  list of day-to-day grumbles also includes poor wi-fi connection, supermarket self-service tills and “being overworked”.Not being able to get a doctor’s appointment, endless spam emails and the terrible British weather are also on the list.Smaller inconveniences such as waking up with bad hair, forgetting to buy milk and someone treading mud into your carpet are included.The research also showed that Brits will admit to moaning three times a day on average about such things as bad customer service, receiving cold calls and pesky queue- jumpers.One in six said they are most likely to whinge in the mornings, with traffic during their commute cited as a top complaint. One third think they moan less at the weekend.Geoffrey Dennis, of the Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad, which carried out the poll, said: “Most people in the UK acknowledge that they complain about trivial matters on a regular basis.“When we’re used to modern conveniences like wi-fi, home deliveries and air conditioning, it can be easy to forget that others have to deal with far greater problems every day.“For people in Britain, everyday problems can seem like the end of the world – and most of us are guilty of complaining about things like bad weather, traffic or people pushing to the front of queues.”The study also found millions prefer to moan in private, with  per cent waiting until they’re in the comfort of their own home before they let off steam.One in five thinks the stereotype of moaning Brits makes us seem miserable while a third find it entertaining.Despite being a nation of moaners, one-fth tend to block out others who moan about their “first world problems”.Around four in ten respondents said they whine more now that they are adults, with half confessing they feel better after getting things off their chest.More than half agree there are far more many moaners today than there used to be.Brits can’t make up their mind when it comes to the weather – half of adults polled said they moan when its rainy and cold one third complain when it’s too hot. And there’s no battle of the sexes when it comes to whinging, as people concur that men and women moan an equal amount.The biggest mood-changers include tiredness, being hungry and the weather, with current relationships, exercise and hormones cited as considerable factors.But sometimes moaning works – four in ten boast they have received money off their restaurant bill after complaining. One in four people believe thatthey moan enough about the price of things, such as homes, bus tickets and meals, then something will eventually be done about it.On the bright side, almost half of people polled reckon they could go the whole day without complaining.Mr Dennis added: “These kinds of inconveniences are so minor compared to the problems faced by many people and animals in the world’s poorest communities”.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4849763.1546072616!/image/image.jpg","title":"hyperloop students join bid to revolutionise transport","story":"The opportunity to help develop a potentially revolutionary new form of transport has sparked huge interest from Scottish students, with around  people at four universities now working on the project.Hyperloop would see passengers travel at -mph in pressurised “pods” along a frictionless vacuum tube, which could cut journeys between Edinburgh or Glasgow and London to - minutes.Teams at Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt, Glasgow and Strathclyde universities are working on the technology, which has bee championed by Elon Musk and Sir Richard Branson.They are among  teams to have reached the design stage of the Musk’s latest SpaceX Hyperloop pod contest, from among some , entries.Students involved said they were attracted by the chance to get involved in a major project while still at university.They include engineers, computer scientists, physicists and product designers.Quentin Pletinckx, studying electronic and electrical engineering at Strathclyde University president of its StrathLoop group, said: “It offers us the space to play our part in improving society without having to wait for graduation.”• : Edinburgh to London in  minutes  Hyperloop moves closer to realityEdinburgh and Heriot-Watt’s HYPED, the largest and most established group with  members after being launched three years ago, said: “Students are driven by innovation and the opportunity to do something inspiring and unique.”Glasgow Hyperloop said: “It offers a rare opportunity to contribute towards something which will be a huge part of the future.”However, the groups dfer in when they think the first passengers will start using Hyperloop.Glasgow Hyperloop predicted it could be as soon as , but HYPED did not expect the UK to see it until around .There has also been scepticism about its safety, but the groups said the technology was still being developed.HYPED secretary Hamish Geddes said: “There are valid concerns regarding safety and feasibility of the Hyperloop concept, however at this stage to be conclusive would be naive.”Matthew Iddon, commercial director of Glasgow Hyperloop, said: “We want to be able to reach speeds that will get people from Glasgow to \u2028London faster than doing two circuits on the Glasgow Subway.“Anybody who is sceptical can be assured it will be safer than modern trains.”HYPED secretary Hamish Geddes said its work included on propulsion systems and the potential to also transport cargo.Strathloop is developing every aspect of the technology, including designing a range of pods such as a premium lounge-style space.Elsa Larsson, its propulsion systems sub-team leader, said: “our task is to make the pod move, and we want to move it fast.“For this, we are using spinning magnets in a way that has never been commercialised, and that also will make our pod levitate.”The Institution of Civil Engineerschose HYPED’s work to feature among  projects to celebrate its th anniversary.ICE Scotland director Sara Thiam said: “The high profile and entrepreneurial flair of Hyperloop’s founder Elon Musk is undoubtedly a draw for students but the students are motivated by its potential to benefit society.“ICE is very interested in the potential of Hyperloop but more research and testing will need to take place to assess the technology on a large scale.“We would then need to carefully consider the challenges and costs of its implementation, its sustainability and most importantly, the benefits it could bring to the passenger over existing methods of transport.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone.

As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion.

Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure.

A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly. Firstly, in a bid to reduce ‘fast fashion’ a fancy-dress option will be available to participants with the focus on homemade outfits. And in a bid to encourage participation and make the event less competitive, prizes on the day will be only awarded to the best-dressed participants. These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role.

I am absolutely delighted as I feel strongly about honouring Ruby’s name and keeping her memory alive.I also took part in the NI Childrens Hospice K Jingle all the way run on Sunday, December , so with the party and the run, I have raised a total of pound,.Lisa has also launched a blogging website called Chasing Ladybirds. The blog is now live and can be assessed by logging on to www.chasingladybirds.The blog provides Lisa with an outlet to share her own journey, Rubys le and in turn provide support for other families going through similar experiences.A face book page called Ruby Powells Journey and an instagram page ChasingLadybirds was the prelude to this, giving family and friends the opportunity to be updated throughout Rubys treatments and milestones.Lisa explained: Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

offer in case of emergency card","story":"Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Policing and Community Safety Partnership , in partnership with local police is launching a new community safety initiative, in case of emergency card , to make sure people get the best treatment at a time when they need it most.Indicating who should be contacted in the event of an accident or emergency, the ICE Card also provides your medical information including any conditions or allergies you may have, medication you are taking and your blood type.An emergency can strike anywhere - you might be far from home, family or friends - and carrying the ICE Card means that your loved ones can be reached quickly and avoids the problem of unlocking mobile for emergency details.Stressing the importance of carrying an ICE Card, Chair of ABC PCSP, Councillor Joe Nelson commented: “This is a very simple yet effective initiative. Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast residents face fourweek wait for bin collection council blames staffing levels","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

What a way to discourage recycling,” one resident wrote.“People will either burn excess paper and cardthey have space to do so or bung it all in black bins or black bin bags for general waste.”In a statement, Belfast City Council said the disruption was due to staffing levels and apologised for any inconvenience.“Due to staffing levels, it has not been possible to provide an alternative collection for blue recycling bins over the Christmas and New Year period,” said a council spokeswoman.“This information was communicated to residents last week as widely as possible, via council’s website and social media channels.“We apologise for the inconvenience. Where possible, we would encourage residents to bring any recyclable materials to their local recycling centre and keep an eye on our website www.belfastcity.gov.uk holidayarrangements and social media for the most up to date information.“We would ask residents who have a scheduled black brown bin collection this weekend and their bin does not get emptied on the day, to please continue to leave it out and we will collect it as soon as possible in the coming days.”In the days leading up to Christmas, a confidential memo by a senior council official was leaked, stating that bin collections could be disrupted due to a pay dispute with staff and trade unions.Nigel Grimshaw, City Hall’s strategic director of city and neighbourhood services, said that staff would be paid time and a half for working on a Saturday , and double time on Sunday .\"However, trade unions and some staff have asked for more money to work on the above days,” he added.\"Their proposal would in effect equate to triple time.\"\"To accept this proposal without proper consideration would likely cause a precedent and would mean applying the same arrangements to other service areas that are provided over this period.\"This could cost the council up to £k additional payroll costs and would have to come out of council reserves as there is no budget for their proposal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boarding schools in republic seeing brexit bounce in enrolment","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Martin described how the \"very friendly fox\" had a weak spot for chocolate and no appetite for fruit. \"One of the ladies I play with always keeps food in her bag and she lted out a banana and tried to feed Donny, but she turned her nose up,\" Aileen recalled. \"I had a Nutella wafer bar so I gave it to her and she absolutely loved it - she would eat right out of your hand.\" The bountul supply of snacks ensured that Donny never made off with Aileens golf ball, but other players were not so lucky. Another avid golfer, who encountered the \"beautul\" fox for the last time just a few weeks ago, said Donny became a mascot for the club. \"She ran off with my ball a few times, but once she realised it wasnt food she dropped it - it was quite amusing and in my case always advantageous,\" he said. The golf enthusiast, who tees off on the prestigious course every Sunday, often witnessed players feeding Donny sausages which she enjoyed. \"There was a vet came to check up on her regularly and she always seemed to be in good health - she looked pretty good the last time I saw her.\"Animal rescuer Debbie Nelson managed to get the distressed vixen to a vet on Monday, but it was too late - Donny died in her arms a few hours later. Joyce McCammon, who said Donnys antics never did her round any harm, learned of the news on Thursday after noticing the wild animals absence on the green.\"It was very sad to hear about it,\" she said. Mrs McCammons husband Bert recalled how the daring fox once tried to run off with his club after picking it up by the handle. \"She didnt get very far,\" he added. The couple both agreed that they will cherish memories of close encounters with the \"majestic\" creature who will be missed by many."},{"url":null,"title":"new year honours omagh centenarian bob lingwoods big surprise","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In   just  graduates in Northern Ireland overpaid a total of £,.This increased every year between   to  , when , graduates overpaid £,.Olivia Potter-Hughes, the president of the National Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland , said the level of overpayments was very shocking.\"It is deeply troubling that there is a situation where students here are overpaying student loans,\" she said. \"It is staggering that around , people are overpaying an average of £ as regards the   year. Think how many weeks income that represents for students.\"She said it was important that those who overpaid were reimbursed as a matter of urgency.\"We want to see moves to reduce student debt through the provision of additional public funding for student support and higher education,\" she added.\"Investing more in tertiary education will deliver signicant benefits to the economy by driving the economy with skills and qualications, while also helping remove barriers to people commencing courses.\"Ulster Unionist MLA Rosemary Barton said the arrangements had become \"ridiculous\", adding: \"The system is clearly broken.\" She said: \"This obviously isnt a one-off or a blip, the problem is getting worse with every passing year and unfortunately increasing numbers of graduates are getting caught up by it.\"Its ridiculous that the problem has been going on for so long and these latest figures would suggest that nothing whatsoever has been done to resolve it.\"Ms Barton called on the SLC to get to the root of the problem and sort it out.\"It is also long past time that the Government should step in and intervene, given its responsibilities,\" she added. The SLC said student loan over-repayments occur due to the nature of the Income Contingent Repaymentstudent loan repayment scheme, which has been in place since , where repayments are made through the UK tax system via Pay-As-You-Earn . ICR student loan repayments are collected through the UK tax system where borrowers remain in the UK. The SLC said it receives student loan repayment information annually from HMRC, and the result of this process means that some borrowers nearing the end of their repayments may over-repay. The SLC said it proactively contacts borrowers to advise them they have over-repaid their loan. It said thatan over-repayment is identied on a borrowers account, money over-repaid will be refunded, plus interest. The borrower can also contact SLC to request a refund. The SLC said it was working with HMRC to consider how repayment information can be shared more frequently between the two organisations.The SLC said the percentage of borrowers overpaying their loans had not increased signicantly since  .\"There is no need for customers to over-repay their loan,\" it said. \"Providing they have kept their contact details up to date on their online account, they will receive a letter from us when they are within  months of repaying the balance of their student loan account in full, inviting them to manage their final repayments by opting into our direct debit scheme. \"This moves them out of the PAYE scheme and on to a direct debit which means that their repayments stop immediately when their loan is repaid.\"The SLC said any person who goes into credit by £ or more in a particular year will be included."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37660589.ece/7cbe5/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Police_drink_driving_.jpg","title":"pictured drink driving blamed after car ends on roof on derry roundabout","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture Northern Ireland Office official Peter Smyth explained: \"The privilege of being allowed to install such gates is apparently not extended to the Roman Catholic community and has caused considerable resentment in the area.\"Old allegations of Royal Ulster Constabulary collusion with the unionist community are reviving.\"Roslea is a village close to the border, around  miles to the south-east of Enniskillen. State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary In  some nationalists living there felt Protestants were receiving favourable treatment when it came to accessing cross-border land, an archived British Government note released by the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland in Belfast said.The dispute highlighted the localised impact of an Irish border, which had been closed for years because of the danger of republican attacks.The official record from  surrounded a meeting with an influential member of the community in Fermanagh, Gerry Lynch, and highlighted some of the social sensitivities around the -mile frontier.Mr Lynch claimed Catholic farmers had approached the RUC to secure access through lockable gates, but been refused.Mr Lynch maintained: \"Any attempts by Catholic farmers to create temporary bypasses for purposes of bringing in crops quickly attracted the wrath of the police.\" State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain The NIO official added: \"All the bypasses he knew of had been granted to Protestant farmers and the perception was growing that, once again, the local Catholics were being treated as second-class citizens.\"Mr Smyth said the RUC considered applications for gates on a case-by-case basis.He added: \"I have no doubt I was given a fairly subjective account of the situation but there was no mistaking Mr Lynchs sense of injustice.\"Relations between the nationalist community and the security forces are always delicate around Roslea and Mr Lynch has worked harder than most to keep things on an even keel.\"He feels that he has gone out on a limb for the past two or three years and is genuinely disillusioned by the apparent failure of the local RUC to make some gesture of reciprocity.\" Was the  Good Friday Agreement secretly planned by the Government six years earlier  The records also discussed security concerns about a future IRA attack on a police station in Co Tyrone using an improvised border crossing created by a farmer to straddle a stream on his land.A four-wheel drive vehicle had been employed in previous attacks and the RUC wanted to excavate the stream to make it impassable to traffic.The farmer suggested an alternative involving blocking access to the field, but was unable to ask local contractors to do the work for security reasons."},{"url":null,"title":"state papers thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in guildford four case","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"instagram apologises for rolling out horizontal scrolling test too widely","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Hard to believe there was a Congress  President who would approve!— Donald J. TrumpDecember , The impact on the public of the impasse grew as the Environmental Protection Agency, which had the money toa week longer than some agencies, implemented its shutdown plan at midnight on Friday night.Agency spokeswoman Molly Block said many of its , employees are being told to stay at home, while disaster-response teams and certain other employees deemed essential will stay on the job.Also running short on money, the Smithsonian Institution said its museums and galleries popular with visitors and locals in Washington will close from midweekthe partial shutdown continues.Mr Trump appears no closer to securing money for his signature border wall, which he vowed during the presidential campaign that he would make Mexico pay for.He has failed to do that – and now Democratic leaders are adamant they will not authorise money for the project, calling it wasteful and ineffective. They show no signs of bending, either.“We are far apart,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Friday.Mr Trump tweeted: “We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirelythe Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall  also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with.”He also threatened to cut off US aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, among countries he deems have not done enough to combat illegal immigration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Donald Trump is demanding  million US dollars for the Mexican border wall He has made similar threats in the past without following through, and it is Congress, not the president, that appropriates aid money.The shutdown is forcing hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors to stay at home or work without pay.Mr Trump’s incoming chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Democrats are no longer negotiating with the administration over an earlier offer by the White House to accept less than the  billion US dollarsthe president wants for the wall.Democrats said the White House offered to accept . billion US dollarsfor border security, but Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told vice-president Mike Pence that was not acceptable. It was also not guaranteed that Mr Trump would settle for that amount.Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador reacted cautiously to Mr Trump’s threat to close the border, calling it an “internal affair of the US government”.He added: “We are always seeking a good relationship with the United States. We do not want to be rash.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry couple give christmas gift nurses helped save twin babies lives","story":"Two little Derry twins have delivered an early Christmas present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a kettle and a toaster.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“As my we says, when the parents go home at night we are leaving our babies in their care.”The couple gave the nurses a voucher for a fridge freezer, cups, plates, cutlery, glasses a George Foreman grill, a set of knives, a radio and a £ MS voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said.

will then be published early in the New Year with a further  days then set aside for public comment before a final scheme is published.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews, who appealed to voters in Crossgar concerned about not being able to vote in their home village to respond to the consultation, hopes ldquocommon sense will prevail.He and a number of his Rowallane colleagues remain concerned that people who live within touching distance of the designated polling station at Glasswater Primary School, will have to make their way either to a church hall in Drumaghlis or Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The local politicians say it is somewhat ironic that people who live on the periphery of Crossgar will be able to vote in the village, but those who live in the heart of the village will not.They believe the Electoral Officersquos draft proposal is ldquoflawed and have warned it will particularly impact on the elderly and those who have no access to public transport.Cllr Andrews said the draft proposal will have a ldquodetrimental effect on the people of Crossgar and district.ldquoResidents in the centre of the village will have to bypass Glasswater Primary School polling station and travel three miles to vote in Drumaghlis or five miles the other way to Killyleagh, he continued.ldquoIn my opinion, this draft proposal is senseless, flawed and discriminatory and treats Crossgar residents like second class citizens. What do people who have no access to transport do when it comes to casting their vote Cllr Andrews said that with an estimated population of , people, voters in Crossgar were being treated dferently to those in Killyleagh, Saintfield and Ballynahinch.ldquoI hope this proposal will be revisited so people in Crossgar and the surrounding district can enjoy the right of exercising their democratic right to vote in their own village, something many others take for granted where in the district, he declared.ldquoThe bottom line is thatyou live in Crossgar and intend to vote in next yearrsquos council elections you will have to travel either three miles to Drumaghlis or five miles to Killyleagh which simply isnrsquot on.He added: ldquoI sincerely hope common sense prevails and that this ridiculous draft proposal will be consigned to the bin where it belongs.ldquoWhat is really ironic is that while people in Crossgar must travel outside the village to vote, those in areas including Annacloy and Bells Hill will be heading into Crossgar to cast their vote. You couldnrsquot make it up.Consultation responses should be forwarded to info@eoni.org.uk before pm this evening..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Review of recycling centres  ","story":"THE future management of the districtrsquos three household recycling centres will be discussed in the New Year.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is organising a special workshop on January  for all of the local authorityrsquos  councillors to consider a number of recommendations following a review of current operations in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan.Future access policies is one of the key areas which came in for special attention as part of the review which also examined a potential ban on taking black bin bags full of unsorted waste to any of the centres.Local authority officials have been carrying out an in-depth review of the operation and management of the centres with details of the exercise outlined last month when politicians were told that almost , tonnes of waste are taken to the districtrsquos three recycling centres each year.Councillors were also told that that the local authority is legally obliged to provide dedicated centres for household waste which are free to use.The centres are viewed as key weapons in the councilrsquos battle to reduce waste to meet a directive to recycle  per cent of all waste generated across the district by . Given the fact that this is just over  months away, the review of the current operation and management of the household recycling centres was ordered.A pound, budget is being set aside to improve the operations at all the local authorityrsquos recycling centres and to finance a new communications strategy. The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning unsorted black bin bag waste which will have a signicant impact, given that thousands of people regularly empty a iety of waste into such bags and take them to the recycling centres.Elsewhere, council officials want to challenge the perception that the household centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.Officials say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the local authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling facilities.The review also examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive. The number of recycling centres and their opening hours will also come under the microscope during next monthrsquos workshop.The event will explore the reviewrsquos recommendations and agree an implementation date, with the agreed way forward to be mapped out at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s farewell to Hugh  ","story":"SPA Golf Club brought a unique six-decade era to a close on Saturday when its longest playing member Hugh Hegan left for pastures new.Club captain in  and president two years ago Hugh has been a keen and regular competitor on the Spa fairways since his father mdash also called Hugh mdash introduced him to the sport in .Captivated by golf from the very beginning, Hugh played to a handicap of two at his peak and along the way established himself as one of the leading contenders at Spa.Over the years Hugh, who now has a highly respectable handicap of , has won many trophies including the Spa Cup mdash as a teenager in lsquo mdash Captainrsquos Day events and represented the club on Senior Cup, Junior Cup and Ulster Cup teams.As he said farewell to his many friends at Spa, before leaving for St Andrewrsquos in Scotland with his we Anne to be closer to their daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren, Hugh reflected on the changes to the club which he will always call home.ldquoWhen I joined it was just a nine-hole course at the old Spa.ldquoThe facilities were basic to say the least.

You had Enniskillen. These are not failures of our making.“These are things that happen within Northern Ireland where your security forces operate. There is no way we can patrol  miles.”Mrs Thatcher, who became increasingly exasperated during the meeting added: “I don’t know what to do about the border.”She went on to say she was disappointed in the SDLP and John Hume: “They have the gt of the gab, but no, they won’t talk to their people and tell them to join the RUC.

The savagery was unbelievable.“I will never be prepared to walk out and let the terrorists win.”A press release issued after the meeting said that “a great deal of useful work had been done” between the two leaders.The meeting came in a particularly tense time for the two leaders as Mrs Thatcher had written to the Taoiseach in April telling him she was “deeply upset” at speeches he had made in New York and Hard.“You seem to be arguing that the persistence of violence actually calls into question the existence of Northern Ireland as an entity. To me, such an admission would be tantamount to a surrender to terrorism,” the letter read.Mr Haughey had made it clear to the British leader in a secret message four days before the meeting that he utterly rejected violence.“As an Irishman it has always been a matter of deep regret for me that Ireland is ided.“A united Ireland could not come about through violence, and every act of bloodshed on this island sets back further the date when what I hope for most deeply can be achieved.”try catch  TrendingNew Year Honours: Northern Irelandrsquos full list revealedSadness at death of lsquocaring and compassionatersquo RUC welfare championDeclassied files: Margaret Thatcher blasted Irish failure to extradite IRA priest suspectDeclassied files: lsquoWe should quit NI and let Irish butcher one anotherrsquoDeclassied files: Just one thin file, with pages removed, on Mull of Kintyre Chinook crash          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all. I would like to thank her for writing the book - especially with the personal things.The book is pound at www.jamessommerinrestaurant. co.uk  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Beth was one of those rare people who always seemed kind and sincere.People remarked that she was always patient and helpful, always listened to your answer when she asked you how you were.\"She was no push-over either, though.

Shersquod always challenge an idea or an argumentshe wasnrsquot convinced by it.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hard to believe there was a Congress  President who would approve!mdash Donald J. TrumpDecember , The impact on the public of the impasse grew as the Environmental Protection Agency, which had the money toa week longer than some agencies, implemented its shutdown plan at midnight on Friday night.Agency spokeswoman Molly Block said many of its , employees are being told to stay at home, while disaster-response teams and certain other employees deemed essential will stay on the job.Also running short on money, the Smithsonian Institution said its museums and galleries popular with visitors and locals in Washington will close from midweekthe partial shutdown continues.Mr Trump appears no closer to securing money for his signature border wall, which he vowed during the presidential campaign that he would make Mexico pay for.He has failed to do that ndash and now Democratic leaders are adamant they will not authorise money for the project, calling it wasteful and ineffective. They show no signs of bending, either.ldquoWe are far apart, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Friday.Mr Trump tweeted: ldquoWe will be forced to close the Southern Border entirelythe Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall  also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with.He also threatened to cut off US aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, among countries he deems have not done enough to combat illegal immigration.Donald Trump is demanding  million US dollars for the Mexican border wall He has made similar threats in the past without following through, and it is Congress, not the president, that appropriates aid money.The shutdown is forcing hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors to stay at home or work without pay.Mr Trumprsquos incoming chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Democrats are no longer negotiating with the administration over an earlier offer by the White House to accept less than the  billion US dollarsthe president wants for the wall.Democrats said the White House offered to accept . billion US dollarsfor border security, but Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told vice-president Mike Pence that was not acceptable. It was also not guaranteed that Mr Trump would settle for that amount.Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador reacted cautiously to Mr Trumprsquos threat to close the border, calling it an ldquointernal affair of the US government.He added: ldquoWe are always seeking a good relationship with the United States.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
