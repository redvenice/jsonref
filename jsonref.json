Photograph: Parliamentary Recording UnitEPAThe intervention by House of Commons speaker John Bercow on Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement motion came as a “surprise”, the Tánaiste said tonight.Speaking at an Irish Embassy St Patrick’s Day event in Brussels on Monday night, Simon Coveney said Mrs May can still ask for an extension to the Brexit process and the EU can still discuss the issue at a two-day meeting beginning on Thursday“A number of us listening to Westminster today were somewhat surprised that a procedure of the House has been used to potentially prevent a meaningful vote happening before the summit. That’s a matter for Westminster to resolve,” he said.“There was always the potential for the PM to come to an EU summit and seek a longer extension. She made it very clear last week that if she wasn’t able to have a meaningful vote that endorsed the withdrawal agreement she would request a longer extension of article 50.“So that’s what we can expect will happen now on Thursday and Friday.”‘Significant intervention’His comments were echoed by the Irish commissioner Phil Hogan and Irish MEP Mairead McGuinness, although she insisted the British prime minister may have difficulty providing the justification for an extension needed by EU leaders.Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil’s Brexit spokeswoman, Lisa Chambers, portrayed the speaker’s move as a “significant intervention”.“It has increased the possibility of the UK seeking a longer extension of article 50 and the uncertainty that comes with that,” she said.David Cullinane of Sinn Féin said that, in order for that to happen, the British would have to get agreement from the European Union on legal changes to the withdrawal agreement, and he said there was “no chance” of that happening.Referring to Mr Bercow’s invocation of the rule that dates back to 1604, Mr Cullinane said: “A 400-year-old rule, very rarely if ever invoked, has potentially derailed her last chance to get the withdrawal agreement through.”Fine Gael spokesman Senator Neale Richmond said it was an unexpected development. “It’s very interesting but it is another instance of an internal Westminster issue that we cannot impact.

Scientists have developed facial recognition technology to assess pigs’ emotional statesScientists have developed facial recognition technology to assess pigs’ emotional states based on facial look with a project to help improve animal wellbeing. The researchers say they are able to tell from a pig’s expression if it is content or distressed. They are developing a tool to monitor inidual faces and alert farmers via their mobile phone to any health and welfare problems – often, distress on their faces is apparent before medical symptoms are evident due to illness.Pigs are known as highly expressive and vocal animals. Previous research from Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC) in Midlothian showed they can signal their intentions to other pigs using different facial expressions and make different expressions when in pain or under stress. In their latest project they capture 3D and 2D facial images of breeding sows under typical situations likely to result in different emotional states. They can experience lameness and show different facial expressions relating to pain before and after being given pain relief. Pigs appear calm and content when satiated, which is reflected in their expressions.Images were processed at the University of the West of England Bristol’s Centre for Machine Vision, where machine learning techniques are being developed to automatically identify different emotions conveyed by particular facial expressions.Dr Emma Baxter from SRUC said: “Early identification of pig health issues gives farmers the potential to improve animal wellbeing by tackling any problems quickly and implementing tailored treatment for iniduals. This will reduce production costs by preventing impact of health issues on performance.”“By focusing on the pig’s face, we hope to deliver a truly animal-centric welfare assessment technique, where the animal can ‘tell’ us how it feels about its own inidual experiences and environment. This allows insight into both short-term emotional reactions and long-term inidual ‘moods’ of animals under our care,” she added.After validating the techniques, the team will develop the technology for use on farms where inidual sows in large herds will be monitored continuously.A vet who specialises in the Irish pig sector, Pat Kirwan, who is based in Clondalkin, Co Dublin, confirmed the benefits of analysing facial expression in pigs. While there was a difference between “what I feel and what they feel”, facial expression (grimacing or a form of smiling) vocalisation, whether pigs were lying down or rooting, “are all useful indicators of welfare”, he explained.None was a deal breaker in his view, but a good pig farmer would take all these things into account and the SRUC breakthrough could become another useful tool in the assessment of welfare, he said.On vocalisation, he said it was like listening to children in a playground the sounds of joy and crying can be distinguished quickly. He often goes into a pig farm and knows immediately “if the pigs are barking like dogs they are happy in their environment if they are silent, there is something wrong”. Some pig farmers already deploy speakers to monitor for coughing in pig herds, he said.Prof Melvyn Smith from UWE Bristol’s Centre for Machine Vision said machine vision technology offers the potential to realise a low-cost, non-intrusive and practical means to biometrically identify inidual animals.“Our work has already demonstrated a 97 per cent accuracy at facial recognition in pigs. Our next step will be, for the first time, to explore the potential for using machine vision to automatically recognise facial expressions that are linked with core emotion states.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Takeda admits he signed over about 1.5 million yen to Singapore consulting companyAhead of elections, Philippines president names political rivals on list of \u0026lsquonarcopoliticians\u0026rsquoMan accused of gunning down 50 people in attacks on two Christchurch mosquesCuvier\u0026rsquos beaked whale showed signs of starvation, dehydration and had been vomiting bloodTurkey\u0026rsquos president is condemned for showing video of Christchurch assaults at rallies\u0026lsquoFirearms community\u0026rsquo set to stymie Ardern pledges in wake of Christchurch massacresCountry also hit by earthquake, triggering landslip that hit popular waterfall on LombokSuspect Brenton Tarrant (28) understood to have held firearms licence and five gunsSite to remove any clip of gunman\u0026rsquos footage even if it would not normally break its rulesAt least 50 dead after gunman opened fire in two mosques in ChristchurchAustralian politicians call on social media companies to do more to prevent violent content after live stream of attack went viralMosque shooting survivor chased away the gunman armed only with a credit card machineDeath toll rises to 50 as 36 remain in hospital police have confirmed\u0026lsquoHad it provided details that could have been acted on immediately it would have been\u0026rsquoPrime minister says gun laws will change after 49 are killed in Christchurch mosque shootingsThe country has an estimated 1.5 million firearms in a population of under five millionSocial media company says video was quickly removed after police alerted itPeople in Christchurch describe scenes of carnage after mosque attacks leave 49 deadData shows one of three attackers had planned shooting at least 2 years in advancePrime minister says gun laws will change after country\u0026rsquos worst mass shooting"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3831393.1553002303!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may to write to eu seeking brexit extension reports","story":" Political Editor Pat Leahy reports from Government Buildings as EU Council President Donald Tusk meets Taoiseach Leo Varadkar ahead of this week\u0027s crucial EU Council meeting in Brussels.

BBC political editor, Laura Kuenssberg said in a tweet that one cabinet source is “furious that it seems PM avoiding making an actual decision again”.In Ireland, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar welcomed Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, to Government Buildings in Dublin on Tuesday as the UK deals with a constitutional crisis and struggles to reach agreement on Brexit before the March 29th deadline. The meeting is to discuss Brexit and other issues on the EU agenda, ahead of the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday.Meanwhile in Brussels, Tánaiste Simon Coveney where he will meet separately with European Parliament’s Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt and the European Union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. In London, the United Kingdom’s plans to leave the EU were thrown into further chaos on Monday night after the Speaker of the House of Commons said prime minister Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement could not be put to another vote without substantial changes.The move put Mrs May’s plan to win parliamentary approval for the deal in deep disarray. Citing a convention dating back to 1604 that was last used in 1920, John Bercow said the British prime minister could not put the same question to MPs in a single parliamentary session.“If the government wishes to bring forward a new proposition that is neither the same nor substantially the same as that disposed of by the House on March 12, this would be entirely in order. What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes,” he said.The Speaker’s statement, which took the government by surprise, came as ministers continued to negotiate with the DUP over the terms on which it could support Mrs May’s deal. If it is not approved at Westminster by Wednesday the prime minister will ask EU leaders on Thursday to agree to delay Brexit, perhaps by nine months.The EU has ruled out making any changes to the withdrawal agreement or offering further legal assurances beyond those agreed in Strasbourg last week.A European Commission spokesman said negotiators are awaiting the UK government’s decision on how to proceed. At the daily press briefing in Brussels he said: “We’re now exactly 10 days away from the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. “We naturally follow all developments in the House of Commons very closely but it’s not for us to comment on or intervene in parliamentary procedures or conventions of the UK. “It will be for the prime minister and her government to decide on the next steps and then to inform us accordingly and swiftly.” - Agencies Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Amir CohenBenny Gantz, Israel’s former top general, wants to end Binyamin Netanyahu’s decades-long dominance of Israeli politics.Gantz (59), who has no political experience and has been reluctant to provide details on his policy platform, only entered politics in December, setting up a new centrist party, Israel Resilience, which last month merged with another centrist party, Yesh Atid, to form Blue and White, after the colours of the Israeli flag.With less than a month to go before the April 9th Knesset elections, polls show the Blue and White alliance will emerge as the largest party, enjoying a lead of between three to five seats over Mr Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party, although the overall right-religious and centre-left blocs remain evenly matched.Good-looking, tall and blue-eyed, Gantz projects an image of calm and trustworthiness. His is a fresh face, untainted by corruption and the dirty deals of Israeli politics, and with an illustrious military career to boot.He was born in Kfar Ahim, a moshav co-operative agricultural community between Tel Aviv and Gaza, in 1959.His parents were Holocaust survivors: his mother from Hungary and his father from Romania.“In many ways, my life began before I was born,” Gantz said. “It began the moment my mother Malka walked out of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. I will always remember the ones who never came out.”Humble upbringingGantz had a humble upbringing, and before enlisting in the army he was sent to an agricultural boarding school by his father, who thought he was growing up spoilt, surrounded by his three sisters.According to relatives, he received “a Mediterranean education”, as he often skipped classes to head for the beach.In the army he joined the paratroopers, and his first assignment as a young recruit was to participate in securing Egyptian president Anwar Sadat’s historic visit to Israel in 1977.In 1991 he led the commando unit that was on the ground in Ethiopia for 36 hours, during which 14,000 Ethiopian Jews were secretly airlifted to Israel.In 2000, when Israel ended 18 years of military presence in Lebanon, he was the last soldier to cross the border and shut the gates.Gantz gained a reputation as a cautious commander and a gentleman during his rise through the ranks. Former general Tal Russo, number two on the rival Labour list, welcomed Gantz’s entry into politics.“We want at the wheel someone who knows how to navigate and Benny has this. Some people see the fact that he’s a mensch and his gentle nature as weakness: I see it as strength.”But there were also controversial incidents during Gantz’s military career that are being used today by his political opponents to question his suitability to lead the country.In 2000, Gantz was the army’s West Bank commander when a 19-year-old Druze border guard, Madhat Yusuf, died after being injured in clashes at Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus.Yusuf bled to death while Israel negotiated for more than five hours with the Palestinian security forces over a safe evacuation for him.Hamas threatBy the time of the 2014 Gaza war, Gantz was the army’s chief of staff. It became clear during the course of the campaign that the military had underestimated the Hamas tunnel threat and was not ready to locate and destroy the tunnels, some of which reached under the border into Israel.Naftali Bennett, the head of the New Right party, said Gantz’s 51 days of “indecision” during the war led to a stalemate.“Gantz is Hamas’s wet dream,” Bennett said. “If Hamas leaders could vote they would vote for Benny Gantz, the hesitant general.”Critics also point out that before entering politics Gantz became the chairman of a Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity company that declared bankruptcy after three years.With support from the left and centre guaranteed, Gantz realised that his only hope of toppling Netanyahu was to attract voters from the right.He played up his military credentials, posting video clips entitled Only the Strong Prevail which boasted about the number of “terrorists” killed in the Gaza war, without mention of the high number of civilian casualties, and showed Gaza neighbourhoods in ruins.“No Israeli leader is king,” Gantz declared in his inaugural election speech. “I thank prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu for his 10 years of service. We’ll take it from here.”Gantz vowed that a government he headed would strive to achieve peace and regional change, but if peace was not possible at this juncture he committed to strengthening West Bank settlement blocs and keeping control of the Jordan Valley and the Golan Heights.Netanyahu has said the choice is now clearer than ever: a strong right-wing government led by him or a weak left-wing government headed by Gantz.The Israeli electorate will decide next month."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3831299.1552996528!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how brexit is being shaped by parliamentary referee john bercow","story":"March 6th, 2019: A series of booming pronouncements were needed from House of Commons Speaker John Bercow as emotions boiled over in Britain\u0027s parliament.

Late last year Bercow faced calls from some Conservative MPs to resign as speaker because of bullying allegations, which he has denied.But Labour MPs backed him to stay in post, aware of his passionate commitment to parliament holding the government to account – and thereby making May’s life difficult.In January he allowed a manoeuvre by pro-EU MPs to force May to present a Brexit plan B within days after she lost her first vote.Conservatives fumed that Bercow (55) was tearing up years of parliamentary precedent.“If we were guided only by precedent, manifestly nothing in our procedures would ever change,” replied Bercow, who served as a Tory MP before he was elected speaker and took on a responsibility to be politically impartial. Bercow has the power to select which MPs’ amendments to May’s Brexit deal are voted on. Upsetting the executiveSince he became speaker in 2009, Bercow has never shied away from upsetting the executive. In 2013 he allowed Eurosceptic Tory MPs to seek to amend the Queen’s Speech, outlining the government’s legislative programme, in a way that some argued pushed the then prime minister David Cameron into accepting a Brexit referendum. Last year he blocked US president Donald Trump from addressing parliament on his state visit to the UK, citing Britain’s “opposition to racism and sexism”.While some Tories appreciate the power he has given to rank-and-file MPs, others fume at what they see as bias. “Some of the ways he talks to our colleagues is unacceptable,” said one senior Conservative MP. “And I’ve never once seen him talk like that to Labour.” Another Tory MP said Bercow was “so unprofessional”.Bercow has defended his handling of Commons debates. A spokeswoman said: “The speaker champions good order in the chamber and parliament’s right to have its say.”Much of the government’s difficulties in parliament stem from the Conservatives’ lack of a Commons majority.Nonetheless, grumbling about Bercow has increased since November. On one occasion when May addressed the Commons on Brexit, the first 31 MPs who Bercow called to speak were all critics of her deal.He was then instrumental in helping Labour to bring an unprecedented motion of contempt in the government, for failing to publish its Brexit legal advice.“The speaker has a political agenda, which is wholly inappropriate,” said James Duddridge, a Conservative MP who led an unsuccessful effort to unseat him in 2017. “Labour find him convenient, because he’s a more effective opposition than their own leader. Who’s made more hits on the government – speaker Bercow . . . or Jeremy Corbyn?”Cab driver’s sonBercow’s rise to prominence is notable for how his political views have changed radically over the years.The son of a London cab driver, he joined a Conservative youth group that produced “Hang Nelson Mandela” posters.Elected as a Tory MP in 1997, he was initially a staunch Eurosceptic. But he moderated his views, and was elected speaker, with Labour support, when the Commons was at a low ebb following the MPs’ expenses scandal.His modernising moves have included the election by MPs of Commons select committee chairs, seizing a power previously held by party whips.Although parliament’s procedures are set out in a book known as Erskine May, he has revived previously little-used arrangements – such as urgent Commons questions, which force ministers to reply to MPs’ concerns on an issue of the day.On Monday, he cited a convention dating back to 1604 in his statement ruling out a third vote on May’s Brexit deal. Even admirers of Bercow, a tennis fanatic, say there is a flipside: grandstanding, pomposity and flashes of rudeness.Last year Bercow was accused of calling Andrea Leadsom, leader of the Commons, “a stupid woman” – a claim he has denied. His former private secretary signed a non-disclosure agreement in 2010, after claiming he had been shouted and sworn at by the speaker. A report by Laura Cox, a former judge who investigated complaints of bullying by Commons staff, concluded it was “difficult to envisage” a culture change under current leadership.No one disputes Bercow’s love of his job. “I am an unusual fellow,” he once told MPs. “I enjoy few things more than listening to my colleagues asking questions and ministers answering them.”Perhaps his love for parliament explains his distaste for a second referendum: in 2017, he described the prospect as “absolutely for the birds”.The speaker has indicated he will step down in 2019, a year later than he first promised. Until then, many MPs admit that trying to sway him is about as effective as shouting at the referee.“It’s a game,” said one minister. “Some people try to rile him. But he’s more powerful. In the chamber he’s all powerful.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Video: ParliamentTV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinisters continued to negotiate with the DUP over the terms on which it could support Theresa May’s deal. Photograph: Leon NealGetty ImagesTheresa May’s plan to win parliamentary approval for her Brexit deal was in deep disarray last night after the Speaker of the House of Commons said it could not be put to another vote without substantial changes.Citing a convention dating back to 1604 that was last used in 1920, John Bercow said the prime minister could not put the same question to MPs in a single parliamentary session.“If the government wishes to bring forward a new proposition that is neither the same nor substantially the same as that disposed of by the House on March 12, this would be entirely in order. What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes,” he said.The Speaker’s statement, which took the government by surprise, came as ministers continued to negotiate with the DUP over the terms on which it could support Mrs May’s deal. If it is not approved at Westminster by Wednesday the prime minister will ask EU leaders on Thursday to agree to delay Brexit, perhaps by nine months.Prorogue parliamentSolicitor general Robert Buckland said the Speaker’s statement meant the government might have to ask Queen Elizabeth to prorogue parliament – ending the current session and immediately starting a new one.“We are in a major constitutional crisis here. There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session. We are talking about hours to March 29th. Frankly we could have done without this,” he told the BBC.Mr Bercow’s statement delighted hard Brexiteers who want Britain to leave the EU without a deal on March 29th, as well as ardent Remainers who want to reverse Brexit through a second referendum.Government was outragedAlthough Downing Street’s official response was to say the Speaker’s statement required “proper consideration”, the government was outraged by the intervention, of which it received no prior warning.Mr Bercow said the statement was not his last word on the subject but he suggested the Brexit deal itself would have to be changed for a new vote to be held.The EU has ruled out making any changes to the withdrawal agreement or offering further legal assurances beyond those agreed in Strasbourg last week.Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is due to hold talks today with European Council president Donald Tusk at Government Buildings. “The meeting is an opportunity to discuss Brexit and other important issues on the EU agenda, ahead of the European Council meeting in Brussels later this week,” a spokesman said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

There\u0027s a reason its rivals have opted to take their regulatory medicine. It really isn’t doing itself any favours by engaging in a fight like this.\u0026nbspAnother problem with the attention that has been given to the company, and its business practices, is that it’s rather detracted form the other important points the committee has made about live music, which makes a hugely important contribution to the UK’s cultural and its economic life.\u0026nbspIt is an industry that employs 28,000 people, and generated almost £1bn in terms of gross value added in 2017, a year in which 29.1m people attended concerns and festivals in the UK.\u0026nbspLooked at in those terms, it is a stunning success. But all is not rosy in its garden and its problems go far beyond people buying tickets from secondary websites and getting fleeced.\u0026nbspThe report highlights numerous issues. Venues have been closing, especially smaller ones. The way in which the benefits of live music are shared around the country is distinctly uneven. In terms of gross spend, for example, the North East generated £51m, compared to £194m in the Midlands, compared to more than £1bn in London.\u0026nbspDespite this the capital has fewer arenas per person than do other major cities and one witnessed stated that it is “trending down” with respect to its international rivals.\u0026nbspThe industry is dogged by competition issues and conflicts of interests that Tom Gray, from the band Gomez, pointed out “would not be tolerated in any other industry”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

A raft of amendments to be voted on by MPs on Tuesday threaten to further muddy the waters as the clock ticks down to Britain\u0027s scheduled departure from the EU on March 29Over the last year, the number of people in work jumped by 473,00 to 32.71 million with two-thirds\u0026nbspof the new jobs added were full-time, the ONS said.ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes said: The employment rate has reached a new record high, while the proportion of people who are neither working nor looking for a job - the so-called \u0027economic inactivity rate\u0027- is at a new record low.But economists cautioned that the headline figures could be concealing deeper malaise.He pointed out that business investment - the part of the economy traditionally leads to increases in productivity and efficiency -\u0026nbspfell in every quarter of the year.\u0026nbspAndrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics said there was no sign that Brexit-related concerns\u0026nbsphad hurt the labour market.It is surprising that the labour market has remained so strong while economic growth has eased. Indeed, annual employment growth of 1.6 per cent\u0026nbspis above growth in the economy of 1.4 per cent, implying that output per worker (productivity) is falling.If a fall in productivity - the amount of goods and services workers produce per hour - was to be confirmed, it would imply less positive news is to come on wages.In the long term wages can only continue to increase sustainably if productivity increases.Minister of state for employment, Alok Sharma, hailed the figures. “Our jobs market remains resilient as we see more people than ever before benefitting from earning a wage, he said.\u0026nbspBy backing the Government’s Brexit deal and giving certainty to business, MPs have the chance to safeguard this jobs track record.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is imperative that the CMA acts promptly and decisively to bring Viagogo into line with consumer law and, until it does so, we advise the public not to buy or sell tickets via Viagogo.”Committee chairman\u0026nbspDamian Collins\u0026nbspsaid that, despite a “boom in live music” in the UK, it is also facing “stark challenges”, with “bad experiences with ticket resale platforms damaging trust in the industry”.He said: “We’re calling on the government to review the effectiveness of the law intended to prevent consumers being ripped off when buying tickets for live concerts.“The government shouldn’t rely on the work of voluntary groups to take on the giants in the ticket resale market but make sure there is effective action to end exploitation, and greater transparency and redress for ticket buyers when things go wrong.“The DCMS committee has taken today the highly unusual step of issuing a warning to the public against using a major secondary ticketing site until it complies fully with consumer law.”A spokesperson\u0026nbspfor Viagogo said it was disappointed to have been singled out and claimed that it provided an “invaluable service”.“Hundreds of thousands of British citizens use our service to buy and sell tickets to their favourite live events every day and never experience any problems,” the firm said.“For those transactions that fall into the 1 per cent\u0026nbspannually where customers do have an issue, the overwhelming majority of cases are due to the unfair and potentially illegal restrictions the event organisers pose simply because customers have chosen to purchase tickets from a competitor of theirs.“We have been complying and will absolutely continue to work constructively with the CMA to make further amends where necessary, all the while putting all of the buyers and sellers who use the platform first.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM’s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum’s children’s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland’s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.Most memorable track: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann’s jukebox musical. Yet, as giddy and eclectic as Luhrmann’s directorial approach may be – making him one of Hollywood’s most unique creative forces – Moulin Rouge!’s doomed love story of a penniless writer (Ewan McGregor) and a courtesan (Nicole Kidman) is still grounded in the same sweeping romanticism that fuels the classic operas from which Luhrmann took his inspiration, including La traviata and La bohème.320 Singin\u0027 in the Rain (1952)Hollywood has (and will forever remain) in love with itself, but no other single film has ever quite shared that joy with audiences in the way Singin’ in the Rain does. A light-hearted parody of the industry’s transition from silent film to sound, MGM struck gold with its stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O’Connor. All three play off each other with both spirit and wit, while demonstrating unmatched technical ability: from the delightful tap routine of “Good Morning”, O’Connor’s pratfalls in “Make ‘Em Laugh”, to Kelly’s now iconic umbrella dance.Most memorable track: “Singin’ in the Rain”It’s a tough decision to determine which of the 10 musicals Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers co-starred in represents the very best of their work. The dance team are responsible for some of the most graceful, accomplished routines ever captured on film – and there’s no denying they made a perfect pair. As Katharine Hepburn is said to have noted: “He gives her class and she gives him sex appeal.” Yet, it’s Top Hat that remains their most fondly remembered collaboration, as a screwball romance of mistaken identities plays out across a series of glamorous locales in London and Venice.Most memorable track:  “Cheek to Cheek”520 Cabin in the Sky (1943)Cabin in the Sky has a complex legacy, and it’s difficult to judge how exactly it should be remembered. On the one hand, it’s a radical work, as a rare example of a musical with an all-black cast produced during Hollywood’s Golden Age. Although it was released by MGM and even nominated for an Oscar, the film was banned in several US cities on its release. However, as the product of a major Hollywood studio in the 1940s, the film is guilty of troubling racial stereotyping in its depiction of folksy, childlike black characters. Although this must be taken into account, the film remains a major part of film history, especially as it provides an opportunity to see some of the greatest black performers of the era – including Ethel Waters, Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong – in one place. It was also the debut film of Vincente Minnelli, who went on to direct the likes of Gigi (1958) and An American in Paris (1951).620 An American in Paris (1951)The height of class and elegance, An American in Paris rises to the top of MGM’s crop of musicals thanks to its George Gershwin score and its unforgettable 17-minute ballet sequence, which cost almost half a million dollars to film. Imagined as a fevered daydream of the film’s main character, Jerry (Gene Kelly), the sequence is a riot of colour and twirling skirts, as Jerry and his love (Leslie Caron’s Lise) traverse across a series of theatrical sets, each stylised to evoke a famous French painter. La La Land’s epilogue sequence is a direct reference to the film.720 The Sound of Music (1965)The third highest-grossing film of all time (when adjusted for inflation), Robert Wise’s adaptation of the stage musical has remained a source of great comfort over the decades. Drawing from the true story of the von Trapp family, who escaped Nazi-invaded Europe to continue their musical career in the United States, the film allows us to believe, even momentarily, in a world where kindness, joy and optimism is all that’s needed to shield us from the evils of the world, as exemplified by Maria (Julie Andrews) herself.Most memorable track:  “The Sound of Music”This wasn’t simply William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet reheated for a new generation. West Side Story injected new blood into one of our greatest tragedies, exposing how relevant the story remained in a decade as ided as the 1960s, when America faced conflicts both on a global scale, in the Cold War, and at home, with continuing racial tensions within the US. As the Jets, the white American gang, and the Sharks, the Puerto Rican gang, fight for control of their New York neighbourhood, two lovers cross the battle lines to offer the hopeful message that love will save us all.The inarguable peak of Bob Fosse’s career as a director and choreographer, Cabaret exemplifies exactly what’s possible within the musical genre. Utilising the Weimar Republic’s booming nightlife scene as a backdrop for the rise of the Nazi Party, Cabaret could be sexy, glamorous, dark, and sinister in equal measure, exploring topics that were largely taboo at the time (including abortion) while still delivering the musical’s traditional exuberance, anchored in Liza Minnelli\u0027s magnetic lead performance.The ultimate cult musical, once described by critic Roger Ebert as more of “long-running social phenomenon” than a film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show now comes with its own rules and traditions – you can either be enlisted to dress up and perform alongside the film, or join in with one of the many callbacks that fans all know by heart. It’s a testament to the film’s glorious, schlocky embrace of B-movie history and its message of feel-good sexual liberation and gender fluidity.Bugsy Malone is an idea that never should have worked on film: would we really sit and indulge in a cast of children playing pretend cops and gangsters? Yet, under Alan Parker’s direction, and thanks to Paul Williams’s riotous lineup of songs, the film is not only a delight, but feels oddly subversive in the way its cast so gamely fill the roles of wisecracking ne\u0027er-do-wells – a smart way to parody the cultural obsession with the machismo of the gangster genre.While the film may have earned its place in the history books thanks to Marilyn Monroe’s now iconic performance of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” – frequently revisited, whether by Madonna or Moulin Rouge!’s Satine – Gentlemen Prefer Blondes also deserves to be heralded for including one of cinema’s greatest double acts. Monroe and Jane Russell are formidable as two best friends on the hunt for the ideal husband, with Russell’s witty cynicist providing the perfect counterbalance to Monroe’s goofy bombshell.1320 Dancer in the Dark (2000)The film’s production history has been mired in controversy after its star, Björk, alleged that she had been sexually harassed by a Danish film director she worked with, with the Los Angeles Times later identifying the accused as Dancer in the Dark’s Lars von Trier. He has denied the allegations. However, it’s hard to deny the film’s cultural significance, as one of the most startling and groundbreaking musicals of the 21st century. Björk’s score adds incredible compassion to the story of an immigrant factory worker who finds herself betrayed by the world and its cruel machinations.Most memorable track:  “I’ve Seen it All”Rob Marshall, whose last film was Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns, has become the go-to director for the modern Hollywood musical. Having also directed Nine (2009) and Into the Woods (2014), his best work is easily Chicago, which became the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1968. It’s a film that dutifully pays homage to its stage origins, including Bob Fosse’s original choreography, while still feeling slick and modern in its invocation of the 1920s and its lurid culture of celebrity criminals.Most memorable track:  “All that Jazz”Director George Cukor knew he had two key ingredients when it came to his take on the musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion: Audrey Hepburn and the gorgeous stylings of Edwardian London. And so, My Fair Lady’s most delightful image remains Hepburn’s Eliza Doolittle, engulfed by an enormous black and white hat, hollering at a race horse to “move your bloomin’ arse!” Doolittle’s resilience and fierce sense of independence endures today, 50 years after the film was first released.1620 The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)Arguably, the film could could be described more as an opera than a musical, since every line of dialogue is sung, accompanied by Michel Legrand’s score – but it’s also a work that feels purely cinematic, in love with how much life and colour can be conjured in every frame. The film remains one of the most purely romantic entries in cinematic history, as Geneviève (Catherine Deneuve), a teenage girl working in her mother’s umbrella’s shop, pines after her lover (Nino Castelnuovo) after he’s drafted to fight in Algeria.The Disney animated musical is almost a genre unto its own, considering how much it has to offer, but if one film must tower above the rest, it’s almost certainly The Lion King. Released at the height of the studio’s renaissance in the 1990s, the film recasts Shakespeare’s Hamlet in the African savannah, offering an epic story that deals with themes of destiny and responsibility, without skimping on the humour. If an entire generation is now scarred by the infamous stampede scene, it’s a price worth paying.Most memorable track: “Circle of Life”Much more than the screen debut of Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins has endured in the hearts of so many because of how it spoke to children: directly, but with a wit that never dared to patronise them. Knowing Mary was to be in on the great secrets lost to world-weary adulthood, and to be welcomed into the bountiful world of imagination and play – as beautifully represented in the Sherman brothers’ musical score and the film’s combination of live-action and traditional animation.Most memorable track: “A Spoonful of Sugar”Although Grease will largely be remembered for its karaoke-primed tunes, what’s often forgotten is how subversive the film actually proved to be at the time of its release. Grease helped break barriers when it came to the teen film, featuring characters (especially female characters) who speak frankly and openly about sex. As much as Sandy (Olivia Newton-John)’s “bad-girl” transformation can elicit eyerolls today, the scene isn’t as simple as a woman changing herself in order to impress a man – it’s also a kickback against the stifling sexual norms of American society.Most memorable track: You\u0027re the One That I WantLa La Land’s legacy is now forever tied to the great snafu of 2017’s Academy Awards, but there’s more to Damien Chazelle’s modern musical than a besuited Ryan Gosling trying to suppress an embarrassed giggle on the Oscars stage. A love letter to the genre’s history, it’s a film that both pushes forward while looking back, much like the ill-fated lovers at the centre of its story.Memorable track: “City of Stars” 120 The Wizard of Oz (1939)All the tricks and gimmicks of today’s filmmakers could never upstage The Wizard of Oz’s grand reveal, as Dorothy (Judy Garland) takes her first step into cinema’s bold, technicolour future. Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM’s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum’s children’s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland’s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.Most memorable track: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann’s jukebox musical.

As Katharine Hepburn is said to have noted: “He gives her class and she gives him sex appeal.” Yet, it’s Top Hat that remains their most fondly remembered collaboration, as a screwball romance of mistaken identities plays out across a series of glamorous locales in London and Venice.Most memorable track:  “Cheek to Cheek”520 Cabin in the Sky (1943)Cabin in the Sky has a complex legacy, and it’s difficult to judge how exactly it should be remembered. On the one hand, it’s a radical work, as a rare example of a musical with an all-black cast produced during Hollywood’s Golden Age. Although it was released by MGM and even nominated for an Oscar, the film was banned in several US cities on its release. However, as the product of a major Hollywood studio in the 1940s, the film is guilty of troubling racial stereotyping in its depiction of folksy, childlike black characters. Although this must be taken into account, the film remains a major part of film history, especially as it provides an opportunity to see some of the greatest black performers of the era – including Ethel Waters, Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong – in one place. It was also the debut film of Vincente Minnelli, who went on to direct the likes of Gigi (1958) and An American in Paris (1951).620 An American in Paris (1951)The height of class and elegance, An American in Paris rises to the top of MGM’s crop of musicals thanks to its George Gershwin score and its unforgettable 17-minute ballet sequence, which cost almost half a million dollars to film. Imagined as a fevered daydream of the film’s main character, Jerry (Gene Kelly), the sequence is a riot of colour and twirling skirts, as Jerry and his love (Leslie Caron’s Lise) traverse across a series of theatrical sets, each stylised to evoke a famous French painter. La La Land’s epilogue sequence is a direct reference to the film.720 The Sound of Music (1965)The third highest-grossing film of all time (when adjusted for inflation), Robert Wise’s adaptation of the stage musical has remained a source of great comfort over the decades. Drawing from the true story of the von Trapp family, who escaped Nazi-invaded Europe to continue their musical career in the United States, the film allows us to believe, even momentarily, in a world where kindness, joy and optimism is all that’s needed to shield us from the evils of the world, as exemplified by Maria (Julie Andrews) herself.Most memorable track:  “The Sound of Music”This wasn’t simply William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet reheated for a new generation. West Side Story injected new blood into one of our greatest tragedies, exposing how relevant the story remained in a decade as ided as the 1960s, when America faced conflicts both on a global scale, in the Cold War, and at home, with continuing racial tensions within the US. As the Jets, the white American gang, and the Sharks, the Puerto Rican gang, fight for control of their New York neighbourhood, two lovers cross the battle lines to offer the hopeful message that love will save us all.The inarguable peak of Bob Fosse’s career as a director and choreographer, Cabaret exemplifies exactly what’s possible within the musical genre. Utilising the Weimar Republic’s booming nightlife scene as a backdrop for the rise of the Nazi Party, Cabaret could be sexy, glamorous, dark, and sinister in equal measure, exploring topics that were largely taboo at the time (including abortion) while still delivering the musical’s traditional exuberance, anchored in Liza Minnelli\u0027s magnetic lead performance.The ultimate cult musical, once described by critic Roger Ebert as more of “long-running social phenomenon” than a film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show now comes with its own rules and traditions – you can either be enlisted to dress up and perform alongside the film, or join in with one of the many callbacks that fans all know by heart. It’s a testament to the film’s glorious, schlocky embrace of B-movie history and its message of feel-good sexual liberation and gender fluidity.Bugsy Malone is an idea that never should have worked on film: would we really sit and indulge in a cast of children playing pretend cops and gangsters? Yet, under Alan Parker’s direction, and thanks to Paul Williams’s riotous lineup of songs, the film is not only a delight, but feels oddly subversive in the way its cast so gamely fill the roles of wisecracking ne\u0027er-do-wells – a smart way to parody the cultural obsession with the machismo of the gangster genre.While the film may have earned its place in the history books thanks to Marilyn Monroe’s now iconic performance of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” – frequently revisited, whether by Madonna or Moulin Rouge!’s Satine – Gentlemen Prefer Blondes also deserves to be heralded for including one of cinema’s greatest double acts. Monroe and Jane Russell are formidable as two best friends on the hunt for the ideal husband, with Russell’s witty cynicist providing the perfect counterbalance to Monroe’s goofy bombshell.1320 Dancer in the Dark (2000)The film’s production history has been mired in controversy after its star, Björk, alleged that she had been sexually harassed by a Danish film director she worked with, with the Los Angeles Times later identifying the accused as Dancer in the Dark’s Lars von Trier. He has denied the allegations. However, it’s hard to deny the film’s cultural significance, as one of the most startling and groundbreaking musicals of the 21st century. Björk’s score adds incredible compassion to the story of an immigrant factory worker who finds herself betrayed by the world and its cruel machinations.Most memorable track:  “I’ve Seen it All”Rob Marshall, whose last film was Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns, has become the go-to director for the modern Hollywood musical. Having also directed Nine (2009) and Into the Woods (2014), his best work is easily Chicago, which became the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1968. It’s a film that dutifully pays homage to its stage origins, including Bob Fosse’s original choreography, while still feeling slick and modern in its invocation of the 1920s and its lurid culture of celebrity criminals.Most memorable track:  “All that Jazz”Director George Cukor knew he had two key ingredients when it came to his take on the musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion: Audrey Hepburn and the gorgeous stylings of Edwardian London. And so, My Fair Lady’s most delightful image remains Hepburn’s Eliza Doolittle, engulfed by an enormous black and white hat, hollering at a race horse to “move your bloomin’ arse!” Doolittle’s resilience and fierce sense of independence endures today, 50 years after the film was first released.1620 The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)Arguably, the film could could be described more as an opera than a musical, since every line of dialogue is sung, accompanied by Michel Legrand’s score – but it’s also a work that feels purely cinematic, in love with how much life and colour can be conjured in every frame. The film remains one of the most purely romantic entries in cinematic history, as Geneviève (Catherine Deneuve), a teenage girl working in her mother’s umbrella’s shop, pines after her lover (Nino Castelnuovo) after he’s drafted to fight in Algeria.The Disney animated musical is almost a genre unto its own, considering how much it has to offer, but if one film must tower above the rest, it’s almost certainly The Lion King. Released at the height of the studio’s renaissance in the 1990s, the film recasts Shakespeare’s Hamlet in the African savannah, offering an epic story that deals with themes of destiny and responsibility, without skimping on the humour. If an entire generation is now scarred by the infamous stampede scene, it’s a price worth paying.Most memorable track: “Circle of Life”Much more than the screen debut of Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins has endured in the hearts of so many because of how it spoke to children: directly, but with a wit that never dared to patronise them. Knowing Mary was to be in on the great secrets lost to world-weary adulthood, and to be welcomed into the bountiful world of imagination and play – as beautifully represented in the Sherman brothers’ musical score and the film’s combination of live-action and traditional animation.Most memorable track: “A Spoonful of Sugar”Although Grease will largely be remembered for its karaoke-primed tunes, what’s often forgotten is how subversive the film actually proved to be at the time of its release. Grease helped break barriers when it came to the teen film, featuring characters (especially female characters) who speak frankly and openly about sex. As much as Sandy (Olivia Newton-John)’s “bad-girl” transformation can elicit eyerolls today, the scene isn’t as simple as a woman changing herself in order to impress a man – it’s also a kickback against the stifling sexual norms of American society.Most memorable track: You\u0027re the One That I WantLa La Land’s legacy is now forever tied to the great snafu of 2017’s Academy Awards, but there’s more to Damien Chazelle’s modern musical than a besuited Ryan Gosling trying to suppress an embarrassed giggle on the Oscars stage. A love letter to the genre’s history, it’s a film that both pushes forward while looking back, much like the ill-fated lovers at the centre of its story.Memorable track: “City of Stars” Anderson-Lopez and Lopez said:\u0026nbsp“The power of Frozen comes from the story of two strong, very real women saving their world by leaning in to their deep love for one another. Expanding this story has been an absolute joy. We went deeper and discovered several song moments that enrich the story in a new emotional and theatrical way.”The Frozen musical will tour\u0026nbspNorth America this autumn, with productions in Australia and Japan opening in 2020. A sequel to the film is also set for release on 22 November.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

Fox hunting suspended24 February: slaughter of livestock begins27 February: agriculture minister\u0026nbspNick Brow, announces £200m compensation for farmers1 March: outbreaks in Northern Ireland and Scotland confirmed. Cost of epidemic put at £2.6bn8 March: more than 100 cases. Chief veterinary officer\u0026nbspJim Scudamore\u0026nbspsays outbreak will last ‘for a long time’13 March: first case in France. US and Canada ban European exports22 March: first case in Ireland. About 50 new cases reported daily28 March: Blair asks public to visit rural areas to limit cost to tourism2 April: Blair announces general election will be held on 7 June23 April: suspected case of human catching virus25 April: Phoenix the calf saved from cull3 May: Blair says UK is in ‘home straight’\u0026nbspafter 1,536 cases and 2.5 million slaughtered4 May: hundreds of footpaths reopened7 May: government announces £24m package to help businesses £625m expected for farmers3 July: cost to tourism put at up to £4bn18 July: Blair rules out public inquiry9 August: start of three independent inquiries20 August: first sale of live cattle since start of crisis, in Orkney islandsAt the Kirkwall sale, Jim Walker, president of the National Farmers’ Union Scotland (NFUS), warned that complacency could reignite the epidemic. “We have to remember that foot-and-mouth is still raging across the border in England,” he said. “The last thing we want is for it to start up again in Scotland, because then all the games are off, and we’ve got 3.5 million animals to shift between now and the end of the year.“We have been through hell and back and this is a small but important step forward. There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

Even the simplest migration can run into hurdles and the consequences for the business can be severe, hampering customer experience, reputation and ultimately revenue.Facebook at 15: How Mark Zuckerberg took over the internetData migration is sometimes the only option, according to Mr Taylor, in order for a business to catch up with the rapid advancement of technology, though was unable to point to the exact reason for the migration.It has led some to question MySpace\u0027s public narrative, with some suggesting the lost music is the result of trying to get rid of the cost of hosting the files.I\u0027m deeply\u0026nbspskeptical\u0026nbspthis was an accident, Andy Baio, the former chief technology officer of Kickstarter, tweeted.

This would have happened irrespective of John Bercow\u0027s dramatic intervention in parliament to start the week.There has been some speculation that the EU could decide not to permit\u0026nbspan extension, either collectively or because some members are not keen.Do inidual EU leaders have the power to veto Britain\u0027s\u0026nbsprequest for more time?Yes – because any extension has to be unanimously agreed by all 27 other EU member states, any one of them dissenting could block it.

Could populists like Italy’s Matteo Salvini or Poland’s Law and Justice party block an extension? Some Brexiteers – who don’t want Brexit to be delayed – have asked sympathetic EU leaders to prevent\u0026nbspthe Article 50 period from being extended.Bercow’s Brexit ruling is mistaken, but May’s deal is doomed anywayIn January, Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski formally asked the Polish government to block any delay. This doesn’t appear to have been taken seriously by Poland and no response has been given.More recently, this month leading Brexiteers Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore visited Italy. Shortly after, Mr Wigmore said it was “time for Matteo Salvini to help us and veto an extension”.This led some Remain campaigners to suggest there was a plot afoot to block a delay. Mr Salvini – who is notably Italy’s interior minister, not its prime minister, and so has no personal vote – has had his\u0026nbspown battles with Brussels and is\u0026nbspsuspected to be sympathetic.A far more likely reason for a blockage would be if EU leaders collectively decided it was against the bloc’s interest. They might see value in giving Britain a deadline to concentrate mindsNotably, many Brexiteers themselves don’t appear to believe it\u0026nbspwill happen.“They won\u0027t, there\u0027s no hope of us getting a veto, they\u0027re not going to spend their political capital in the EU on a country that is about to Leave,” Tory MP Jacob Rees Mogg said on LBC radio on Monday.Does anyone else have cause to veto an extension? A far more likely reason for a blockage would be if EU leaders collectively decided it was against the bloc’s interest. They might see value in giving Britain a deadline to concentrate minds. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspEmmanuel Macron has said any extension would have to have a “clear objective” and be based on “a new choice” by the British.Michel Barnier summarised their position\u0026nbsplast week: “Why would we extend these discussions? The discussion on Article 50, that is done and dusted. We have the withdrawal agreement, it is there. That is the question asked and we are waiting for the answer to that.”But really, nobody can be certain what will happen until late on Thursday.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

We’ve been speaking about it for seven years.”Facebook has removed 1.5 million videos of New Zealand attackOldham man arrested for Facebook post ‘supporting’ New Zealand attack Mr Mughal accused social media firms of taking a “racialised” approach to extremism and letting the far-right slip through the net.“We’re dealing with lives here and these guys are dealing with profits,” he added. “This is appalling.”Golding also paid for two adverts that ran on Facebook in recent days.Seen by up to 100,000 people, one advert urged viewers to follow Golding’s “official Facebook page”, and the other linked to a Britain First petition.Golding’s two new pages, including one that had been online for more than four months,\u0026nbspwere deleted after The Independent requested comment from Facebook.The internet giant has said it works to remove extremist content of all kinds using human moderators and artificial intelligence. But it has faced renewed calls to increase its efforts following the New Zealand attack.Ben Wallace, the security minister, told MPs the government would shortly be publishing draft laws against “online harm” that will set out clear expectations for internet firms.“Social media platforms should be ashamed that they have enabled a terrorist to livestream this evil massacre and spread this mantra of hate to the whole world,” he added, in response to an urgent question over the New Zealand attack.Britain First supporter who drove van at curry house jailed“Enough is enough. We’ve been clear that tech companies need to act more quickly to remove terrorist content and ultimately prevent new content being made available to users in the first place. This must be a wake-up call for them to do more.”Britain First’s adverts were permitted despite its official Facebook page and those of Golding and co-leader Jayda\u0026nbspFransen being deleted in March last year.The pair had just been jailed for religiously aggravated harassment, and pressure to remove Britain First pages mounted after its posts were linked to the Finsbury Park terror attack,\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspmurder of Jo Cox and a car ramming that targeted Muslims.At the time, a spokesperson for Facebook said the official Britain First page and those of Golding and Fransen had repeatedly broken its community standards.“There are times though when legitimate political speech crosses the line and becomes hate speech designed to stir up hatred against groups in our society,” a statement said.“They have repeatedly posted content designed to incite animosity and hatred against minority groups, which disqualifies the pages from our service.”Britain First styles itself as a “patriotic political party” and is applying to register with the Electoral Commission in Northern Ireland, while candidates campaign for English council seats.Founded in Swanley as a splinter group of the British National Party, members became known for launching so-called Christian patrols and mosque “invasions”, while campaigning against immigration and Islam.Britain First forged links with extreme nationalist movements across Europe, with Fransen attending a march in Poland where she called Islam a “cancer moving through Europe”, adding: “Our children are being bombed, our children are being groomed and our government does nothing.”The Finsbury Park terror attacker, Darren Osborne, read Britain First posts while planning his attempted massacre of Muslim worshippers, while neo-Nazi Thomas Mair repeatedly shouted “Britain first” while murdering Labour MP Ms Cox.The group gained international notoriety after videos posted from Fransen’s Twitter account were retweeted by Donald Trump in 2017, sparking a diplomatic row between Downing Street and the White House.After being released from prison last year, Golding and Fransen focused their activity on Northern Ireland and have been charged with several other offences relating to protests.Fransen announced she had left Britain First to start an “exciting new chapter” in January, and retains a personal Facebook page.A Facebook spokesperson said: “Hate speech of any kind is not allowed on Facebook and Paul Golding’s pages have been removed for violating our policies.\u0026nbspHowever, there is always more we can do to disrupt people wanting to spread hate online which is why we also collaborate with policymakers, civil society, and others in the tech industry, to help us improve the effectiveness of our approach.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

time to avoid it. But we need to change our attitudes to wasting water,” said Sir James.The Environment Agency chief is set to deliver this message at a speech to the Waterwise conference in London.Stop flushing Yorkshire puddings down the toilet, water company pleadsBesides significant action by the government, water companies and regulators, Sir James is warning that the public must also play a role in tackling this growing threat.“In the last few decades we’ve radically changed behaviour on smoking (everybody did it) and seatbelts (nobody wore them). In the last two years we’ve changed behaviour on plastic,” he will say.“We need water wastage to be as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby or throwing your plastic bags into the sea.“We need everyone to take responsibility for their own water usage.”The Environment Agency previously warned that water shortages may affect people by 2050, and the government has suggested efforts must be made to cut people’s water use.However, an official report also found that enough water to meet the needs of 20 million people in an average day is lost through leakages in the system.Preventing these leaks, as well as larger reservoirs and desalination plants, were all suggested by Sir James as\u0026nbspmethods to prevent the impending catastrophe.We’ll tell you what’s true.

We need something new because if it’s an extension to remain in the same deadlock, how do we get out of this? The British have to come with an initiative that is clear and credible and supported by a majority,” she said.Arriving at the same\u0026nbspmeeting of ministers in Brussels\u0026nbspMr Roth added: “We’re really exhausted by these negotiations and\u0026nbspI expect clear and\u0026nbspprecise proposals of UK government\u0026nbspwhy an extension is necessary. It’s not just a game. It’s an extremely serious situation not just for people in UK but also for the people in EU.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?“For my Government it’s the key priority to prevent a no-deal Brexit. I don’t have any appetite for substance-less, very abstract discussions and negotiations on Brexit. Please deliver, dear friends in London please deliver. The clock is ticking.”Ms May will travel to Brussels on Thursday to meet with the 27 other EU leaders, after parliament approved an extension to Article 50 – which would delay Brexit past 29 March. Under EU treaties, such\u0026nbspan extension must be approved unanimously by all 27 other member states – meaning each one has an effective power of veto.The comments by the ministers are the latest expression of frustration from EU leaders at Britain’s approach to talks, which is seen in Brussels and elsewhere on the continent as erratic, poorly-planned, and ided.\u0026nbspOn Sunday Ms Loiseau\u0026nbspjoked in an interview with the French press that she had nicknamed her pet cat “Brexit” because of the way in which it meowed loudly to leave the house but then stood there when she opened the door.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersIf the UK does not get an extension it will either have to pass the Brexit deal, revoke Article 50 to cancel Brexit, or leave without a deal – with the latter option expected to cause economic chaos.\u0026nbspTheresa May has been criticised by EU leaders before for failing to turn up to meetings in Brussels without clear and precise technical demands. At a summit in December Ms May was reportedly as what exactly is it that you want? by German chancellor Angela Merkel, while she pleaded for assistance to pass her Brexit deal but could not spell out exactly what measures she wanted.We’ll tell you what’s true.

back\u0026nbspher Brexit deal by staging repeat votes are in tatters, after speaker\u0026nbspJohn Bercow dramatically blocked the tactic, citing rules dating back to before the Gunpowder Plot.The prime minister was left stunned by the shock announcement – which torpedoed her hopes of a third “meaningful vote” while threatening MPs with a long delay to leaving the EU if they refused to give way.The dramatic twist, outlawing fresh votes without substantial changes, left ministers scrabbling for solutions – including an extraordinary proposal to suspend parliament and start a new session.It also achieved the remarkable feat of uniting supporters of a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum, who both believed it made their favoured option more likely.The solicitor general, who warned of “a constitutional crisis”, put forward the escape route of ending the current parliamentary session early to get around the 1604 convention invoked by the speaker, which lapses after a fresh Queen’s Speech.Here’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit ruling“There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session,” said Robert Buckland.Created with

12-day session to pass legislation to reduce the power\u0026nbspof the House of Lords.No 10 is also mulling a possible vote to overturn the speaker’s ruling – but this seemed only likely to succeed if there are enough supporters of the deal in the first place.There was no immediate official response from Downing Street, other than to express its fury that Mr Bercow gave no warning of his bombshell announcement, made in the Commons chamber.The speaker said a further meaningful vote\u0026nbspwould be ruled out of order if the motion was “the same or substantially the same” – under a 1604 convention to stop the government bullying parliament on issues MPs have rejected.Ms May has already admitted that the negotiations with the EU are over, making it hard for her to argue that a further meaningful vote will be on a different question.Crucially, the speaker suggested something would have to be renegotiated with the EU to constitute a “change”, rather than, for example, a clarification of legal advice by the attorney general.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?French EU minister names cat ‘Brexit’ because of its indecisive natureMr Bercow told MPs: “What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes.”The Independent revealed in January that pro-EU MPs believed that Ms May’s tactic to bludgeon her deal through, despite heavy defeats, was barred by parliamentary rules.Senior Tories were livid, believing the speaker had once again laid bare his anti-Brexit bias while twisting constitutional rules to suit his purpose.Rory Stewart, the prisons minister, taunted Mr Bercow by tweeting: “‘When I use a word,’\u0026nbspHumpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean.’”He added: “In the normal course of events, as the speaker says, parliament says no, and the issue is dropped.“But in this case, this is not an option, because these votes respond to an instruction in a referendum, endorsed by parliament, which rules out dropping back to the status quo.”Supporters of a Final Say referendum were delighted, with former Tory MP Anna Soubry telling\u0026nbspThe Independent: “It puts a second referendum very firmly at the top of the agenda –\u0026nbspit must do. We need a way out of this and this is the only way out.”Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister and People’s Vote supporter, said: “It is inconceivable now for ministers to carry on trying to force this broken Brexit deal on the people of the United Kingdom.”And David Lammy, a Labour supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said: “If the prime minister wants us to vote on her deal again, she should add an amendment allowing for her deal to be put to the people.”In the short term, the speaker’s intervention killed off any prospect of a third meaningful vote this week – already in doubt as the Democratic Unionist Party failed to switch sides.It appears certain that Ms May will have to ask EU leaders for a long\u0026nbspextension – anything between nine\u0026nbspand 21 months – to the Article 50 process at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.The new departure date will then be put to a “take-it-or-leave-it vote” in the Commons and Lords next week, just days before the 29 March Brexit day.For that reason, it increases the chances of a crash-out Brexit, which the Treasury has predicted could\u0026nbsptrigger a near 10 per cent GDP decline.However, a long extension could also open up the space for a further referendum, which some believe the prime minister might yet embrace if it is the only hope of passing her agreement.Speaking to a silent Commons, Mr Bercow said repeat votes had been blocked on 12 occasions up until 1920 – a situation only not repeated since because of “general compliance”.“This convention is very strong and longstanding, dating back to 2 April 1604,” the speaker said.“It’s a necessary rule to ensure the sensible use of house time and the proper respect for the decision which it takes.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

What I’ve said to President Macron, is the same as what I’ve said to all the EU leaders, it’s nothing to do with the negotiation, because by the way, in the end the Europeans know perfectly well what their position is, what I have been saying to them is that if Britain thinks again, if you get to the point where we do go back to the people, then Europe should also think again.Because the issues that drove Brexit - immigration, questions around the Brussels bureaucracy, the way Europe operated - are actually Europe-wide concerns and not just British concerns.A quick breakdown of the stats for you:The number of people in work jumped\u0026nbsp222,000 to\u0026nbsp32.7 million, the highest since records began in 1971.Unemployment fell from 4 per cent to 3.9 per cent, its lowest since the start of 1975 when Harold Wilson was prime minister.Wages\u0026nbsprose\u0026nbsp1.5 per cent when adjusted for inflation,\u0026nbspthe fastest rate since August 2016.Labour Leave has been fined £8,000 for failing to report donations during the 2016 EU referendum.Electoral Commission director of regulation Louise Edwards said there were 11 donations worth £420,000 during the referendum that went unreported.Ms Edwards said Labour Leave had a responsibility to accurately report donations so the public could see where the money they used for campaigning came from.Please allow a moment for the livbeblog to load\u0026nbspThe ruling, announced in an unexpected statement to the Commons, is a further obstacle in\u0026nbspMs May’s attempts to get a deal agreed by the scheduled Brexit date\u0026nbspof 29 March.A government source said it seemed\u0026nbspclear that the Speaker\u0027s motive here is to rule out a meaningful vote this week which also stands in the way of a securing a shorter extension.(This) leads you to believe what he really wants is a longer extension, where Parliament will take over the process and force a softer form of Brexit.But anyone who thinks that this makes no deal more likely is mistaken - the Speaker wouldn\u0027t have done it if it did.”Solicitor general Robert Buckland said the government was facing a major constitutional crisis and that Mr Bercow\u0027s intervention would have huge reverberations for the Brexit process.We’ll tell you what’s true.

What the chancellor isn’t allowed to say is that what he’s really talking about is a negative idend from not having a deal,” Mr Johnson said.Economists have also cast doubt on whether the chancellor has a potential war chest of £26.6bn, as he has argued.The figure depends on him abandoning his longstanding target of balancing the books by the mid 2020s, it is argued.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Despite the humiliating rejection of Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal, Britain is no closer to knowing the end result of its vote to leave the European Union. A raft of amendments to be voted on by MPs on Tuesday threaten to further muddy the waters as the clock ticks down to Britain\u0027s scheduled departure from the EU on March 29Over the last year, the number of people in work jumped by 473,00 to 32.71 million with two-thirds\u0026nbspof the new jobs added were full-time, the ONS said.ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes said: The employment rate has reached a new record high, while the proportion of people who are neither working nor looking for a job - the so-called \u0027economic inactivity rate\u0027- is at a new record low.But economists cautioned that the headline figures could be concealing deeper malaise.He pointed out that business investment - the part of the economy traditionally leads to increases in productivity and efficiency -\u0026nbspfell in every quarter of the year.\u0026nbspAndrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics said there was no sign that Brexit-related concerns\u0026nbsphad hurt the labour market.It is surprising that the labour market has remained so strong while economic growth has eased. Indeed, annual employment growth of 1.6 per cent\u0026nbspis above growth in the economy of 1.4 per cent, implying that output per worker (productivity) is falling.If a fall in productivity - the amount of goods and services workers produce per hour - was to be confirmed, it would imply less positive news is to come on wages.In the long term wages can only continue to increase sustainably if productivity increases.Minister of state for employment, Alok Sharma, hailed the figures. “Our jobs market remains resilient as we see more people than ever before benefitting from earning a wage, he said.\u0026nbspBy backing the Government’s Brexit deal and giving certainty to business, MPs have the chance to safeguard this jobs track record.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It happens when it rains hard.But this spring, the poppies have been so abundant and so strikingly coloured – orange peel, marigold and burned copper – that the number of people coming to walk among them has simply been too many.\u0026nbspAs a result, the city was forced to say “no” to visitors, after what some officials termed a “super bloom apocalypse”.“The city has expended all available resources to address the #SuperBloom,” they wrote on the the city’s Instagram page. “We have brought in all available staff, as many outside traffic controllers that we could, more shuttles, and our small city can not sustain crowds of this magnitude – our city is not made for Disneyland-size crowds.”It urged residents: “Please, we need your help and understanding. This is beyond our control. So please stay out of this area and stay off local roads if possible.”Created with Sketch.\u0027Super bloom\u0027 covers US desert in bright flowers: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Poppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaMother and child among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPeople sit in a super bloom of poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man stands among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA group of men take photos near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man walks among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA couple take a selfie among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA woman poses for a photo among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaMother and child among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPeople sit in a super bloom of poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man stands among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA group of men take photos near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA man walks among blooming wildflowers near Borrego Springs, CaliforniaA couple take a selfie among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaA woman poses for a photo among blooming poppies in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaPoppies bloom in Lake Elsinore, CaliforniaLocal media said as many as 50,000 people visited the poppy fields over the weekend – a figure that was twice that of the weekend before. Residents have complained about traffic jams, as visitors have arrived as early as 5.30am to visit the wildflowers, whose burst of growth was triggered by recent record-breaking rainfall. One person was reportedly hurt in a traffic accident.For the last few weeks, crowds have swarmed onto the fields, many ignoring\u0026nbsp instructions that they stay on the designated path. Some have even picked the flowers to take home.\u0026nbspMayor Steve Manos told The Independent he had never known a\u0026nbspbloom as spectacular as the one this year. “It only happens when it rains hard,” he said. “The last one was 2017, and before that it was 2010.”“People were pulled over on the side of the road to see the flowers as we drove here,” she said. “It was amazing to see the number of flowers grow as we got closer.”Mr Manos, mayor of the city located 70 miles to the south east of Los Angeles, posted videos of himself helping direct traffic on Facebook, to try and give an insight into how bad the situation was.\u0026nbspOn Monday morning, amid some criticism over the shutdown, the city said access to Walker Canyon had been reopened, though parking was extremely limited.\u0026nbspMr Manos appeared in another brief video, standing in front of people walking through the footpaths amid the flowers.REDIRECT Nature Studies by Michael McCarthy: A Western Isles idyllWild flowers are overpowered by exhaust fumesBritain’s most common wild flowers are latest species to disappearThe last stand of the wild flower“As you can see, there are a number of people behind me here to experience the bloom.\u0026nbspBut we are full.

Or was it just another slip of the tongue by the former vice president with a reputation for veering off script?In a keynote speech at a dinner for the Delaware Democratic Party on Saturday, Mr Biden boasted he has “the most progressive record of anybody running.”The only problem is Mr Biden has not announced whether he will launch a third run for the White House, despite repeatedly teasing the possibility.He quickly corrected himself, clarifying that he meant to say “anybody who would run,” then adding “I didn’t mean it” while a cheering crowd in his home state nearly drowned him out.Although Mr Biden has been known to go off script, his remark is likely to be viewed as a Washington-style gaffe – a case of accidentally telling the truth.Created with Sketch.Who could be running against Trump in 2020?

This led other cities across Japan, including Tokyo and Osaka, to develop tactile paving in the following years.Seiichi Miyake\u0026nbspinvented tactile paving, also known as tenji blocksHowever, it was not until the 1990s that Miyake’s invention became commonplace in western countries such as the UK, US and Canada.The most common types of tactile paving include raised lines or domes. The former design indicates that it is safe to walk on a particular path, while the latter acts as a ‘stop’ sign to alert users to potential dangers.Created with Sketch.

One man is seen kicking the boy while he is on the ground. On Sunday, the prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters: “The full force of the law should be applied to Senator Anning.” Victoria Police has said it is investigating the actions of the senator and his supporters as well as those of the teenager.One of those who tackled the boy was far-right activist Neil Erikson, who was controlling access to the building. During the scuffle to apprehend the boy, he shouted for reporters to be removed from the area. “Get the journalists out of here ... If you don’t like, get out,” Erikson said, according to The Sun-Herald newspaper. While the child was being held in a chokehold, one of Mr Anning’s supporters is heard telling him: “You are nothing but a weak human f***ing being, you f***ing prick.”New Zealand attacker’s gun club was reported to police, man claimsDeath toll from New Zealand terror attacks rises to 50Egg a day may increase heart attack risk, study saysThe teenager has won considerable support for egging the far-right senator. A crowd-funding page set up to help pay for any legal fees he may face has raised almost 30,000 Australian dollars (£16,000). The page initially said: “Money raised will go to EggBoi for: Legal fees. More eggs.”But it was later updated to say the 17-year-old “is committed to sending a majority of the money to the victims of the Christchurch terrorist attack.”In a video posted after the egging incident the boy urged people not to follow his example. “Don’t egg politicians. You get tackled by 30 bogans at the same time,” he said in the video, using Australian slang for an unsophisticated person. “I learnt the hard way,” he added. Mr Anning caused outrage after the attack in which 50 Muslims were killed in two mosques, with a statement calling Islam “the religious equivalent of fascism”.He said: “The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.“Let us be clear, while Muslims may have been the victims today, usually they are the perpetrators. World-wide, Muslims are killing people in the name of their faith on an industrial scale.”He added: “The truth is that Islam is not like any other faith. It is the religious equivalent of fascism. And just because the followers of this savage belief were not the killers in this instance, does not make them blameless.”A Change.org petition to remove him from parliament has accrued almost a million signatures and has made it the biggest and fastest-growing petition ever hosted on the platform.

They patched up their marriage and remain together.Last year we reported the couples love le could suffer from the silencing of Big Ben as Sally finds the bongs a turn-on in their apartment beside the clock tower.The Speaker of the House of Commons is supposed to remain impartial, sitting as a non-partisan figure.But Mr Bercow has often been accused of being completely anti-Brexit.Speaking to students from Reading University in February , the Sundayreported that he said: Personally, I voted to remain.I thought it was better to stay in the European Union than not.He has broken with convention to give Europhile MPs the chance to pass wrecking amendments which undermine Theresa May.The Speaker dined with Mr Clarke, the former Chancellor, at the Kennington Tandoori near Parliament on Wednesday night.Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen stormed: It appears that the Speaker is conspiring with Remainer MPs to stop Brexit and subvert democracy.The Poppadom Plot is part of the Remainer elites trying to overturn the democratic will of the British people.On March , , Berow controversially ruled out a third vote on the Prime Ministers withdrawal agreement because it was not substantially dferent from the previous iterations.Bercow was elected the th Speaker in June  following the resignation of Michael Martin in the wake of the MPs expenses scandal.Many of his Tory colleagues are said to have been bitterly against him but he is believed to have won the support of hundreds of Labour MPs in a secret ballot.Bercow is the first Jewish Speaker, and the only one not to wear traditional court robes while presiding over the House.He has also ditched clerks wigs and said MPs do not need to wear a tie, upsetting many traditionalists.Many Conservatives claimed the Speaker was biased against them and Bercow repeatedly clashed with PM David Cameron.A Tory plot to oust him days before the  general election failed and he was re-elected unopposed in the new Parliament.Bercow was re-elected again in June  after the snap General Election.In  he had told supporters he would serve no more than nine years - meaning he would have quit in June .In October  he reportedly told friends he would step down the following June, after ten years as Speaker.It came as MPs told him to his face he should quit in a fiery Commons debate.Similar reports earlier in the year claimed his we and four kids had grown tired of living in Parliament and urged him to call it a day. The Speaker played a crucial role on January , when he allowed seven of  amendments which have been designed to restructure Brexit.Any successful amendments will not have the force of law, but will show Downing Street and Brussels what kind of Brexit MPs are likely to approve."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000325988194.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"travel back time sun writers","story":"This week the idea of travelling to the past came closer after scientists claimed it was possible.A Russian experiment defied the law of physics which states that “time’s arrow” only goes from past to future.While a Doctor Who-type Tardis is still a long way off, it is tempting to imagine reversing mistakes or reliving former glories.We asked some of our writers where they would go on their time travels . . .I WOULD travel back to the moment when I was asked to audition for the role of CJ in the most recent Baywatch film.I received a call from the producers asking me to audition.It was a huge opportunity for me that I did not embrace or take very seriously.Instead of going to acting classes and trying to perfect my Calornian accent, I fluffed the whole thing. I got my two best friends to record me reading a scene from the movie and we stupidly decided to do it after a bottle of wine for Dutch courage.When I sent my audition tapes through I sounded more Irish than American and I missed out on a potentially huge role.I just wish I had put my mind to it more, but I didn’t really have an interest in acting back then.Kelly Rohrbach got the lead and looked amazing in it. The film wasn’t actually that great . . . but it would have been pretty cool to work alongside Zac Efron and The Rock.SET the controls for the best day of my childhood – Saturday July , , a glorious day of sunshine and showers when England won the FIFA World Cup Final against West Germany.Every second of it is etched in my mind – Nobby dancing, Bobby Moore’s golden aura and Kenneth Wolstenholme’s commentary.“There are people on the pitch – they think it’s all over – it is now!”It was a day to make you believe in magic.I watched it, aged , with my mum – my dad worked every weekend – and I squeaked “F***” when the Germans equalised to make it - at the end of normal time.It was the only time in my le that I ever said “F***” in front of my mum.She forgave me immediately “as it’s the Germans,” she said, the Blitz still fresh in her memory after  years – and went to put the kettle on as we settled down for extra time.It was a day of excitement, pride, patriotism, passion and pure, undiluted drama.WHEN I was a kid I wanted to be an astronautand also an RAF fighter pilot.I was lucky enough to be taken up in a Phantom jet in September , when I helped launch the annual air show at RAF Leuchars, in Fe.Awesome is an overused word, but not in this case.I was given training, poured into a G-suit and for the next hour I had the thrill ride of a letime.Obviously I did nothing but sit there enthralled while not touching any important buttons.We pulled three Gs, which was a bit like being cuddled by a gorilla, but women withstand G-Force better than men and, unlike Jeremy Clarkson, I managed not to throw up.At one point I was upside down and flying so fast I felt I had left my body behind.I wish I could go back in time to relive that moment again and again.I HAVE done a lot of really stupid things – often on purpose. When I told my mum I was leaving college to join a band she told me not to be stupid. But that actually worked out OK.For sure I’ve taken plenty of bad advice over the years and committed countless, colossal clangers.If I could go back in time I absolutely would but not to sort out any of my messes.I’d like to make something that was totally brilliant even more mind-blowingly brilliant than it was to start with.It would be to the summer of . I’d just got my new racing bike. That bike was my first true taste of freedom.I spent the whole summer tearing all over Dorset with my two best friends.I’m not sure anyone ever felt quite as free in the moment as that -year-old boy racing a new bike down a massive hill as fast as possible in the sunshine.There’s no way I’d let my kids do it now. Far too many cars on the road. But I can remember exactly how it felt, clear as anything. Woo-hoo.I WOULD go back to the autumn of , when I was living in New York.My flatmate was in real estate and he had got wind of an apartment building, jointly owned by the residents, that had gone bankrupt.He said you could now buy two-bedroom apartments in this building for as little as ,. It was a risk, sinceit didn’t come out of bankruptcy I’d lose everything.But the upside was thatit came out of bankruptcy, the flat would immediately multiply in value. He was going to buy one. Did I want to buy the one next door I owned a flat in London and could have drawn down on my mortgage to borrow the money.I ummed and ahhed about it and, eventually, chickened out. You can probably guess the rest.My flatmate bought an apartment for ,, the building’s finances were restored and it’s now worth .million.I would like nothing more than to use a time machine to buy the flat next door. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Starting over is just not an option — andNo Deal is unpalatable toMPs, then the obvious solution is to support leaving with a deal.Secondly, a y delay puts us in the awkward position of having to stand candidates for the European Parliament election.This would be a humiliation and the public would be right to be furious.Worse still, as part of an offer for a long extension, the EU may require us to hold a second referendum.Thirdly, we came dangerously close to a backbencher coup — where those who did not win the right to govern wish to take over the role of government, in an extra-ordinarily unconstitutional move that would overturn years of parliamentary conventions with the sole aim of stopping Brexit.Make no mistake, their motives were not to deliver a dferent Brexit or to honour the result of the referendum — it would be to stop Brexit in its tracks. All the while, our hard-working voters and our long-suffering businesses just want to get on with le beyond Brexit.In a survey by market researchers Survation, the majority of Conservative voters said they would take Theresa May’s deal over every other option — No Deal, a long delay or another referendum.There is, however, an obvious solution to all this — and every parliamentarian can choose to take it.I spend my days at the legislative coalface as Leader of the House of Commons. I know what we need to get done to leave the EU in a smooth fashion — and I also know that we do not need is a y extension.While the negotiators have been hard at it in Brussels, I’ve been preparing for and delivering the legislative changes needed for Brexit to make sure our laws work when we leave.So I know thatwe get this deal passed next week, we can deliver Brexit quickly — and potentially much faster than the end of June.If both Houses — the Lords and the Commons — acknowledge the country’s desire to get this settled, we can crack on with passing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.A short extension to get the legislation finalised is far better than a long one — which would come with unacceptable conditions we have no control over.In setting out the parliamentary timetable, I will, as I always do, fully respect Parliament’s desire to scrutinise and debate.But I will also be looking to move quickly, so Parliament can turn its attention to the wealth of opportunity that awaits us when we leave the EU.As I said at the dispatch box this week, this is an important time for Parliament and there have been dficult decisions to make.With such strongly held views across the House, it’s vital that we continue to listen to each other with respect and understanding.Over the centuries, the country has looked on as Parliament has faced historic decisions.Even in the most challenging of times, we have pulled together and put our duty above all .So I hope the House will now find a consensus that delivers on the will of the people to leave the EU as close to March  as possible.We can then, finally, turn our eyes to the bright future ahead of us and seek to reinstate confidence in British politics.Let’s do our duty — and do our country proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We all stand united as brothers and sisters”.Her defiant words are a fitting epitaph for the New Zealand victims: “We must tell them you will not win.”ENOUGH is enough on the Brexit shambles. We want out as soon as possible.A poll today shows that  per cent want PM Theresa May to ignore MPs and leave the EU without a deal.Buther exit plan does not get past Parliament, Britain’s departure could be postponed for two years. As Andrea Leadsom says, a y delay would be humiliating.MPs must unite behind the deal on the table — or waste the chance of a letime to wave goodbye to Brussels.Sort it.

But the vast majority are determined to frustrate Brexit, regardless of the result of our biggest ever democratic exercise.Labour is now far more interested in north London than the north of England.The threat of Remainers wrecking our departure gets more pressing by the day.Brexiteers must accept reality and back the best Brexit possible: the PM’s deal.MIKE Thalassitis’ suicide is a wake-up call for Britain’s TV companies — and the country at large.Suicide is the single biggest killer of men under  in the UK.

One of Barto’s victims was just two weeks old when he assaulted her.Lee Ann Berkebile, , was one of the two girls involved in the  case, having been molested by the doctor when she was four.Speaking of her relief at Bartos upcoming sentence, she told The Associated Press: After -some years, I’m just glad it’s finally over, and he can’t do it again. He’s a real sicko. He just makes me really disgusted.Barto appeared before the Pennsylvania Board of Medicine, accused of molesting two girls in the s, back in .The board dismissed the case against him at the time by a - vote, describing the allegations against him as incongruous to his reputation,” reports The State.Barto received mass support from the local community in the wake of the allegations, with hundreds of people attending a rally held at a local restaurant in which he denied the accusations.After getting his medical licence back, Barto went on to molest at least a dozen more victims until his arrest in January .In a letter to parents addressing the allegations against Barto, Laurel Pediatrics said: “Please know that, while this is a very dficult time for all of us, our first priority remains ensuring that your family continues to receive the very best care.We ask that you continue to reassure your children that our doctors and staff are here to take care of them whenever they need us.”The Pennsylvania Department of State, which provides legal and administrative support to the board and prosecutes administrative cases of doctor misconduct, said last year that the Board of Medicine takes allegations of sexual misconduct by professional licensees very seriously.Regulators have not commented on the boards  decision.The attorney general’s office is asking for  to  years in prison."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000476674908.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sheep semen stored 50 years impregnates 34","story":"Samples were taken from four rams back in , and still worked just fine, despite reportedly being the world’s oldest frozen semen.Australian researchers defrosted the samples, taken by scientists from the University of Sydney.They inseminated  Merino ewes – and  became pregnant.The  per cent success rate was higher than that of sperm frozen for only a year - which impregnated  per cent of inseminated ewes.The team said that their research revealed there was “no dference between sperm frozen for  years and sperm frozen for a year”.University of Sydney associate professor Simon de Graaf said: “This demonstrates the clear viability of long-term frozen storage of semen.”“The results show that fertility is maintained despite  years of frozen storage in liquid nitrogen.”The semen had been stored as pellets in vats of liquid nitrogen below -C.The lambs appear to display the body wrinkle that was common in Merinos in the middle of last century, a feature originally selected to maximise skin surface area and wool yields.This characteristic had been largely bred out of Merinos, because it made shearing harder and increased the chance of fly strike.Because the new offspring are from old-stock, it will allow the researcher to compare whether the old characteristics were beneficial or not.The success will bolster hopes that plunging eggs and sperm into the deep freeze is a credible long-term way of providing endangered species with a leline.The original semen samples were donated in the s from sheep owned by the Walker family of Yass Plains."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000475949346.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ally ross on all star musicals","story":"John Barrowman had flagged it up at the previous week’s skating final.“If you like Dancing On Ice, you’ll love.Andyou don’t . . .Nothing could still probably prepare you for what went down, over two hours, at the London Palladium.A show that, much like Popstar To Operastar, Soapstar Superstar and X Factor: Battle Of The Stars before it, took seven minor celebrities out of their sacred “comfort zone” and allowed them to murder some of your favourite West End standards.This being an ITV show, there was also a theatre audience vote and a  of mealy mouthed, over-scoring judges, Strictly’s Kevin Clton, Trevor Dion Nicholas, from Aladdin, Elaine Paige, with the death gurgle laugh, and a new one on me called Kristin Chenoweth, who is unusual in that she not only sounds like a helium balloon but looks a bit like one as well.Host for the night was Barrowman, whose every link carried a fairly hefty threat: “Still to come, Alan Titchmarsh reveals his romantic side.”Before we came to that pretty pass, however, there was an unfolding catalogue of other singing horrors.Tessa Peake-Jones hit the bottle during her Mamma Mia routine, Joel Dommett took an eternity to beat the le out of The Nicest Kids In Town, from Hairspray, and Emmerdale’s Amy Walsh said there would be “expectations”, about her Fanny Brice number, because she’s the sister of Girls Aloud’s Kimberley Walsh.There would indeed, Amy.Clear the building.

The main one being anger by the look on his face.Like next door’s kids had just punted their football straight into his prize begonias, it was.The audience went nuts for it, though, the judges were in floods of overwhelmed tears and, must admit, even I was aware I was watching something that would be played again and again, for both good and bad reasons.But I must urge caution here. Antony Cotton got his own ITV chat show after winning Soapstar Superstar.It just needed Simon Cowell tuning in on Sunday, and, before you know it, he’s got Titchmarsh back in the white blazer trying to Dream The Impossible Dream for the Christmas No.Still, we have to look for the positives, and what I’ll ultimately take from All Star Musicals is the fact John Barrowman appeared on telly, for two entire hours, and didn’t shout: “FAB-U-LOUS!” once.Progress. FRIDAY.

I told Stephen Parkinson I won’t budge on it when he arranged the phone call yesterday. I think she rang me as a last ditch effort. I’m not going to change my mind and I reiterated that in conversation - and told her a lot of other people are going to do that.

You can have the same motion but where the circumstances have changed.Other options he discussed to make the motion dferent were attaching the Article  extension to it, or some changes on Northern Ireland guarantees that are being thrashed out with the DUP at the moment, he suggested.Last night Westminster was ided on what the latest dramatic turn meant for Brexit.Brexiteer James Gray told Newsnight: “It’s my view that this ruling by Mr Speaker Bercow will mean that Britain will not now leave the European Union at all.Veteran Tory backbencher Alec Shelbrooke accused the Speaker - who has admitted he voted Remain - of trying to kill Brexit.Today the PMs spokesperson said that Britain was essentially now in crisis over the deadlock.They admitted: If you look back at the speech the PM gave just before MV, thatMPs don’t support MV we would be in crisis, I think events yesterday tell you that has come to pass.The little known precedent — used just  times, the last in  — bans the Government from asking MPs to vote on the same motion more than once in a parliamentary session.It was drawn up after King James interfered in the Sherf of Buckinghamshire’s election — by demanding a second vote, so his candidate could be elected.Mr Bercow, whose we had a b****cks to Brexit sticker on her car, wants to use the delay to try and keep us in the EU, other critics argued.Meanwhile ‘Remainers’ in Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP pushing for a People’s Vote lavished praise on the Speaker.A Government source said: “It seems clear that the Speaker’s motive here is to rule out a Meaningful Vote this week, which also stands in the way of securing a shorter extension.“It leads you to believe what he really wants is a longer extension, where Parliament will take over the process and force a softer form of Brexit.“But anyone who thinks that this makes no deal more likely is mistaken — the Speaker wouldn’t have done itit did.”The PM is set to go to Brussels to ask for an extension to Article  this week.Shell demand a short extensionshe gets the deal through in the coming days, but could be forced into a long one of monthsshe doesnt.After Speaker Bercows bombshell intervention that the PM cant bring back the same vote to the Commons again, it was rumoured that the Government could ask the Queen to end the current Parliamentary session and start a new one.Theres a rule which means the same motion can only be voted on once in each Parliament.If its dferent, ora new session is started, then it can come back for a new vote.But this morning Stephen Barclay vowed to keep the Royals out of it.He told Sky: One thing I think everyone would agree on is involving her Majesty is not the right option.And he insisted that the best way for MPs to end the Brexit impasse is to vote for the current deal and get it through.Meanwhile, hardline Tories threatened to go on strikethe PM carries out her vow to delay Brexit by a year.As many as  members of the hardline European Research Group have told whips they will carry out “vote strikes” - a move that would push Mrs May’s minority government to the verge of collapse.As Conservative tensions over Brexit reached boiling point around the PM’s ultimatum strategy, one senior Tory backbencher told The Sun: “If she tried to go ahead with a long extension, there will be vote strikes on all Government legislation."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT0004769238291.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow brexit bbc interview","story":"The Commons Speaker made a string of sarcastic jokes when he was approached by the BBC this morning.He ignored repeated questions about his controversial move to stop Theresa May holding a third vote on his Brexit deal.Mr Bercow was filmed walking to work in Parliament and asked: Can you explain to the public what you did yesterday But instead of responding, he said, I really feel you ought to get yourselves some coffee or tea - then made a joke about the reporters hat.Pressed on the issue, the Speaker sneered: Im sure people are so very grateful to you for showing such interest at this time in the morning - very grateful to you, very well done.As the camera crew crossed the road with him, Mr Bercow snapped: Careful, careful!

I under­stand these talks were broadly positive. One Cabinet minister close to the process tells me the chances of the DUP backing the deal are, “a bit better than :. I’d put it at :”.What is winning round the DUP is the promise of putting into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which puts the deal into UK law, a requirement that there be no ergence between Northern Ireland and Britain.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill would be so-called superior legislation. This would mean it would trump any other bill, giving the DUP some reassurance that the next Prime Minister couldn’t let regulatory dferences emerge between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland.Parliament will also be given a scrutiny power over the backstop, allowing it to vote every few years on how it is operating.At the same time, the UK Government will seek to offer the DUP some reassurance about this country’s ability to get out of the backstop. I am told thatAttorney General Geoffrey Cox’s legal advice had been dferent, then the DUP would have been on board this week. One Cabinet minister tells me:“Geoffrey did cost the DUP.”To sweeten the deal for the DUP, there will be money and ladles of respect. The DUP want a new “policy package” to replace their confidence and supply deal with the Tories which runs out in June.To say that these negotiations are delicate would be an understatement. I am told, “ people put too much pressure on them, there’s a danger that they’ll bolt”.But with this Speaker and this Parliament any hopes for a better one, or for a clean break, seem for the birds.As James Forsyth says, the “big beasts” of the backbenches must show some leadership.Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Iain Duncan Smith were leading lights of the Leave campaign, but by not backing the deal they are now imperilling the whole project. They won’t be forgiven.Good card players know when to hold ’em and know when to fold ’em.Wise politicians must be no dferent.Butthe Government can get the DUP, it is confident that Jacob Rees-Mogg will then come on board.Despite voting against the deal on Tuesday, European Research Group chairman Rees-Mogg left himself a ladder to climb down, repeat­edly declaring that the only reason to vote for this deal wasBrexit was in genuine danger.After the Commons voted against No Deal and for an extension, it clearly is.The big question is how many Brexiteer rebels climb down Jacob’s ladder. Downing Street think there are  to  Tory diehards who won’t vote for the deal even with the DUP on board.The precise number is absolutely crucial. As one senior Downing Street source explains: “If it is at the lower end of that scale, it can be made up with Labour. If it is at the higher end, it can’t be.”There are, I’m told, between  and  Labour MPs prepared to back a deal but onlyit has a realistic chance of passing. Influential figures in the Cabinet are urging No to make the vote on Tuesday a free vote, to make it easier for Labour MPs to support it.If the deal doesn’t pass on Tuesday, then Mrs May will have to go to the European Council on Thursday and beg for a full-on extension to the Article  process. I am told she is dreading this personal and national humiliation.The Commons should spare her and, more importantly, the country, that.RIGHT now there is little sign that either Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab are going to move and back the Brexit deal.Both feel that their reservations about it are still too strong.But there is a danger for them both –  Tory Eurosceptics voted against the deal on Tuesday night.Whatever happens with the DUP, that number will drop a bit when the meaningful vote comes back for a third time.The danger for Boris and Raab is thatthey walk through the lobbies with this shrinking group, they will start to be seen as purely factional candidates, and purely factional candidates rarely win leadership contests.Already some of those who backed Boris last time and had been planning to do so again are peeling away.Now is a moment that calls for bigness.If either Boris or Raab were prepared to say that – despite their reservations – they were going to try to get the deal over the line, because Brexit is only going to get softer otherwise, they would show they have the selflessness necessary to lead.WHEN your voice is going, what’s the last thing that you want  A meeting with a heavy smoker.But that is what Theresa May had to contend with on Monday after she flew to Strasbourg for last-minute talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.By Wednesday, Mrs May’s voice was so bad that No had a plan for Andrea Leadsom,  to take over halfway through PMQsher voice gave out completely.TO get people to do things you need both a carrot and a stick.But the problem for the Government is that its warnings to Brexiteer rebels are all stick.It is pointing out that Brexit will only get softerMPs don’t vote for the deal. This is right, but these MPs need a positive inducement too.One Tory who carries messages from Theresa May’s Downing Street to the Brexiteer rebels tells me: “If she offered to go, she would get very close and possibly do it.“It unlocks those people whose self-perception is that they don’t give in to blackmail.” This source continues: “If the DUP move, Jacobmoves,Jacob moves others follow, but you don’t quite get there without the carrot.”Mrs May could leave with dignity, having secured an orderly Brexit and having managed to avoid a split in the Tory party.She wouldn’t need to leave the next day, either.But just in time to ensure that a new Prime Minister had their feet firmly under the desk before a new European Commission comes into office this autumn.One reason why an indication that May will go is so important is that there is assumption she will try to staythe withdrawal agreement passes.One Cabinet minister tells me: “If she gets a deal through, she won’t be able to resist clinging on.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

John Bercow warned she would not be able to hold yet another vote on her deal unless she makes it substantially dferent. This means getting a new offer from the EU at a crunch summit this Thursday - where sheaposll ask for Brexit to be delayed. Meanwhile the government is in chaos after Speaker Bercowaposs ruling - with one minister admitting itaposs a major constitutional crisis and threatening to end the current parliament. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said today: This is a moment of crisis for our country. Legally there are just  days left to Brexit. But the reality is we could be facing a delay of a year. Here are  fast facts you need to know this Tuesday morning.  Theresa May will convene a meeting of her Cabinet from .am after her Brexit plans were dealt a killer blow by the Commons Speaker. John Bercow scuppered the chance of another Commons vote on the Prime Ministeraposs deal before Thursdayaposs EU summit, leading one minister to warn that the Government faces a major constitutional crisis. A Number  spokesman said Speaker John Bercowaposs statement requires proper consideration. But privately sources were a lot more blunt, furiously saying the speaker - whoaposs regularly accused of anti-Brexit bias - was trying to ensure a softer departure from the EU. Sources now believe itaposs nigh on impossible that a third vote on Theresa Mayaposs deal - previously voted down by majorities of  and  - will go back to MPs this week.    A top Cabinet minister today threatened to go to war with the Speaker, suggesting  Theresa May could ignore the ruling. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay claimed Speaker Bercowaposs judgement didnapost align with things heaposd said previously. That implies the Cabinet could decide to railroad through its decision anyway - and say itaposs the Speakeraposs fault for being inconsistent. The Speaker’s the referee and it’s important that all of us in the House of Commons respect the speaker, Mr Barclay told Sky News. But the Speaker himself has pointed to possible solutions. He himself has said in earlier rulings that we shouldn’t be bound by precedent, and this is based on a precedent going back to . The Speaker himself has said that where the will of the house is for a certain course of action, it’s important that that will of the house is respected. It’s important that we look at his previous rulings in the context of yesterdayaposs ruling as part of taking our next step. Mr Barclay added: We need to look at the detail of the ruling. We need to consider that in the context of some earlier rulings that don’t particularly align with yesterday’s ruling.  Theresa May is now poised to ask for Brexit to be delayed by a year, according to The Sun. The Prime Minister is now doomed to asking  EU leaders for a delay at this Thursdayaposs summit in Brussels. She had agreed to ask for a short three-month delaya deal was passed, but a much longer oneit wasnapost. With pretty much no hope of passing a deal by tomorrow nightaposs deadline, sheaposs now poised to formally ask for a long delay. Reports suggest that request will be for  to  months. But thereaposs a catch - reports also suggest sheaposll ask for a get-out clause that would allow the delay to be shorter , somehow, a deal is approved at the last minute before next Friday. Reports coming out of Brussels would appear to back this up. Senior diplomats tell Reuters that EU leaders could hold off making any final decision, or implementing it, until as late as a few hours before midnight on March . . But it looks like aposendingapos Parliament is off  Last night Solicitor General Robert Buckland admitted Britain is in a major constitutional and political crisis. And he claimed one option could be to prorogue Parliament - effectively shutting it and reopening it again for a new session. That would get round the Speakeraposs ruling - but would mean ditching dozens of half-finished laws. Yet today, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay dumped the idea. He told Sky News: The one thing everyone would agree on is involving Her Majesty in any of the issues around Brexit is not the way forward so I don’t see that as a realistic option.  Theresa Mayaposs Brexit deal only has a slim chance of being approved at the third attempt anyway, a minister admitted last night. Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng endured a dficult session in the Commons as both Remain and Leave MPs pushed him to outline the process to extend Article  and explain the purpose of seeking an extension longer than a few months. At one stage he insisted the UK would leave with no-deal on March an extension to Article  was refused, having earlier said MPs had taken no-deal off the table. In a spirit of optimism I still believe there is a chance, it maybe a slim chance, that the meaningful vote will go through, he said. People can scoff and laugh but I still believe that. A hard core of Tory Brexiteers have already made clear they still wouldnapost back the deal. That leaves Mrs May having to win over Labour MPs with leave seats. Three of those MPs - Caroline Flint, Emma Lewell-Buck and Ruth Smeeth - were briefed on Brexit technicalities by the Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith in a private meeting last night.

However, sources concede a third vote on the deal - previously defeated by  and  - is unlikely before an EU summit this Thursday.

But we must not lose sight of the fact the fault lies at the door of No. Mrs May wasted months not knowing what she wanted from Brexit, and then found she could not persuade enough Conservative and DUP MPs to endorse the flawed deal she brought back from Brussels. Humiliated May is a PM without power. Without credit Desperate women, driven by welfare cuts to sell their bodies for sex, would be a Government crime against decency. MPs launching an investigation into claims this is already happening is damning for Universal Credit, which is inflicting hardship and misery on families in and out of work.

You see, one of the ways politicians and journalists have coped with the mind-numbing drudgery of having to spend all day, every day, for two years talking about something as fundamentally boring as our departure from the EU, is by making up shorthand words to describe it. But that’s left the rest of the country with a hellish glossary of meaningless jargon and confusing buzz-words. Here’s seven words, terms and phrases that nobody will miss when they’re gone. Article   The biggest problem with making people interested in Brexit is that it’s very similar to Star Wars Episode I. Stay with me. After Jar Jar Binks, the most commonly cited reason for Star Wars Episode I being rubbish is that it opens with the Jedi Knights, the last defenders of peace and justice in the galaxy, turning up to help negotiate a dispute over trade tarfs. Literal magical wizards with laser swords were rendered tedious by thrusting them into an argument about taxes. What we should have learned from that is that evenBritain had sent Obi Wan Kenobi to Brussels to deliver our Article  notication, people still wouldn’t care what it was or what was in it, because it’s fundamentally boring. Backstop  Nothing gets hard-Brexiteers quite as furious as the idea that we could be trapped in the Northern Ireland ‘backstop’ for all eternity. But convincing the public that a backstop is a bad thing is a hard sell for the British public. You see, we all grew up being told backstops were good things. Specically, they’re the best fielding position in Rounders. You feel involved in the action and get to do loads of throwing and catching, but the likelihood of having to actually run around anywhere is minimal. Good luck trying to demonise the word ‘backstop’, Jacob Rees-Mogg. We’re reclaiming it for the great British, lazy, glory hunter. No-deal  Until the Summer of , ‘no deal’ was something that people only really said to Noel Edmonds’ imaginary friend. And that’s why the Government is now struggling to convince people that no-deal would leave them materially worse off.    In Deal or No Deal, the worst-box scenario is that you go home with p and Noel’s tanned, wrinkly sympathy face forever burned on your retina for all time. Gamble wrong on Brexit and you’re stockpiling water puriers and eating freeze-dried fish from a bag. Meaningful vote  Theresa May is a woman of many talents, but perhaps her greatest gt is her ability to take basic elements of the English language and strip them of all logic and relevance. Take the ‘meaningful vote’, for example. Presumably it was named that so MPs would think that whatever decision was taken in such a vote would be in some way binding. Now we’re staring down the barrel of a third meaningful vote, and the word meaningful has lost all meaning. It was a meaningless vote. Buccaneering  This is what Brexiteers reckon Britain will be once we leave the EU. A buccaneering trading nation, cutting a swath through the high seas and selling our wares to eager countries across the globe.    And the man in charge of that  International Trade Secretary Liam Fox. A man who looks like he probably gets seasick on the pirate ship at Alton Towers. A swashbuckler he is not. Future relationship  Nobody ever wants to have the conversation about ‘where this relationship is going’. It inevitably leads either to a messy, acrimonious breakup or one of you getting a dog when you don’t want to. Same deal with Europe. There’s a reason Brussels is putting this one off until after we’ve got Northern Ireland sorted.

Robert Christopher Fay warned Lisa Edwards that he would get to her before police got to him. Fay, , also threatened to blow up a BMW and smash all the windows of Ms Edwardsapos home in a series of texts sent on March .Fay pleaded guilty to making offensive communications at North East Wales Magistratesapos Court at Mold yesterday, North Wales Live reports.Justin Espie, prosecuting, said the matter was a domestic case involving his ex who heaposd been on and off with for  years and with whom he has two children and another on the way.  Mr Espie said messages from Fay started at am and continued throughout the day, making threats and abusive comments. He said heaposd blow a BMW up and smash every window in the house, said Mr Espie. One said: aposIaposll get to you before the police get to meapos, and in another he said heaposd boot the baby clean out of her. It was the third reported domestic incident in the last six months, with Fay having previously breached Domestic Violence Protection Notices, which were the result of altercations but not physical violence, the court heard. Melissa Grfiths, defending said Fay has been signed off work sick due to mental health probems. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in  and meets regularly with a psychiatrist. Despite being on and off, the pair had been living at separate addresses for the last two years on the recommendation of social services. Ms Griths said Fay is in the process of changing his medication from tablet to liquid form, which has affected his behaviour. She said: That is partly responsible for the way he behaved, but he doesnapost put that forward as an excuse. The messages were extremely frightening and some contained threats. Ms Grfiths said Fay feels extremely ashamed and that the incident was triggered by messages he allegedly received from his ex-partner telling him she might not let him have access to the baby and his other two children. A pre-sentence report was prepared by the probation service which said that the relationship had suffered as a result of Fayaposs deteriorating mental health over the last three years. The incident was the result of a manic episode while he was struggling to get his medication right, but he agreed that being denied contact to his children was not a reasonable excuse for his actions and said he regretted sending the texts. His moods are unstable and he struggled to rationalise them, the probation officer said. Imposing a -week custodial sentence suspended for  months, chair of the bench Sanjay Bhalla said: We have considered the nature of the communications, specically the message saying heaposd kick the baby out, the three previous domestic incidents and the breach of the DVPN. The matter is so serious that custody is the only appropriate option at our disposal. As part of the suspended term, Fay must take part in a -day rehabilitation activity requirement. A restraining order was also imposed, banning him from directly contacting Ms Edwards for two years, save through an agreed third party. He was also ordered to pay £ costs and £ court surcharge.

He is accused of driving a BMW dangerously and injuring the young people after a game, which his team lost -. Newport Crown Court heard it happened shortly before pm on Thursday, April  last year, Wales Online reports. Prosecutor Christopher Rees said Taylor used his car as a weapon to drive at a group of young people and “mowed them down like skittles in a bowling alley” in a terrying incident. Taylor denies dangerous driving and  counts of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm as well as alternatives of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Jurors were shown pictures of the scene, and told that the BMW suffered a damaged windscreen and lost a wing mirror in the incident. The young people who were injured in the incident cannot be named for legal reasons. Pictures of injuries to some of the alleged victims were also shown to the court.  Mr Rees said: “The prosecution bring the case, the prosecution have to prove the case. “The prosecution case is that at pm on April , Cornelly Football Club were hosting a match against Margam Football Club. “The defendant Lee Taylor was playing in the football match for Margam. “There were around  to  spectators at the game, most of them young persons.” The court heard one spectator was “giving out banter” to the Margam players. Afterwards a group of young people began to congregate around the changing room. Mr Rees said there was “banter” which provoked one of the young people. “The confrontation was looking like it might escalate towards something more serious, a fight,” said the prosecutor. The court heard Taylor walked back to him BMW, got into the car and reversed out of his parking space. Mr Rees said there were school children in the area. He added: “The prosecution say Taylor got into his car, pointed the nose of the vehicle at the group of young persons, revved and raced his engine, his wheels spun, and drove at speed [towards them].” Mr Rees said he “mowed them down like skittles in a bowling alley”. He added: “It was, the prosecution say, a terrying incident.” One boy described the car’s “wheels spinning” and “engine racing”. The impact caused him to fall backwards ft. Another alleged victim “heard screaming” and “saw the BMW coming directly at him”. Mr Rees said: “He closed his eyes at this point. He felt his body make contact with the grass floor.” The court heard some complainants went on to the bonnet of the car. One teen said he was “scared and speechless”. Another was struck by the car, “causing him to be lted off his feet”. The court heard his face hit the windscreen. Mr Rees said a witness described the scene as “carnage”.  The youngest complainant, aged , said he was “frozen in fear” and “thought he was going to die”. Mr Rees said: “He was lying face down on the bonnet.” The prosecutor said a -year-old girl witnessed the incident, stating: “She saw a group of boys being struck. She was able to record the aftermath of it.” A dog walker saw the car “ploughing into” the group, jurors were told, and mobile phone footage was shown to the court. The court heard there was “a fight” and the defendant used his thumb to “gouge” a complainant’s eye. Prosecutors said Taylor then drove away “at speed”. Police attended the scene at around pm, and went to the Sandfields area of Port Talbot, where Taylor lived. The defendant allegedly told officers: “I wasn’t going to stay and take a kicking.” Mr Rees said the complainants attended hospital and added: “It is by sheer good fortune that the injuries were not more serious than they were.” In his police interview Taylor said he was playing for Margam.  He said he was called “fatty” by one of the boys. Taylor said a youth jumped on his car and said he thought he was going “to get a kicking”. Mr Rees said his account was very dferent from the accounts of the witnesses. The defendant was shown the mobile phone footage and said he did not remember a second “scuffle”. Mr Rees said: “He drove deliberately at these boys.” “The prosecution say the defendant got into his car to drive at the group because he had lost his temper. “He knocked them down like skittles. The prosecution say the defendant is responsible for driving at these young men deliberately.” An -year-old - who was  at the time - said he overheard the defendant say “I’ll eat you, you little c***” to another complainant. He said he was struck by the car in the thigh area, stating: It sort of bounced me on to the floor. I sort of slid across the floor. He said he started apospunchingapos the passenger window, telling the court: He was using the car as a weapon. I wanted to stop him hurting anyone . And describing the attack on him, the teenager said: He approached me. I was down into a headlock. He was gouging my eye. He had his thumb and he was gouging my eye. The court heard police and ambulance attended the scene. the -year-old said he later went to the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend.  Asked about his injuries he said: “I broke my hand. Bruising on my arm, my leg. I had a little lump on my eye.” The jury were shown photographs of his injuries taken by the police. The witness said: “You can see just under my right eye, there’s a bit of a lump, a swelling.” He also suffered grazing and scratching to the back of his leg. The witness said the car hit him to his leg. The teenager told the court he got an injury to his hand by punching the car window. Nicola Powell, for Taylor, suggested some people there “wanted his [Taylor’s] blood”. The teenager disagreed. Ms Powell asked: “I’m right in saying it all kicked off, didn’t it ” The witness replied: “Not necessarily.” Ms Powell suggested one of the complainants “had a score to settle” and was “egged on”. The witness responded: “Not really.” Ms Powell suggested her client was trying to make sure there was “a fair fight”. The teenager replied: “He got involved with straight threats.” Ms Powell suggested some iniduals followed him in the car park, but the witness said that was not the case. The teen said the defendant’s car went on to the grass after hitting him. Ms Powell confirmed her client accepts that his car went on to the playing field briefly to turn around a parked car. The teenager said two iniduals had to run down a lane to get away from the BMW. He said the defendant was “chasing” them. Ms Powell suggested there was “a lot of confusion” and asked the witnesshe could have misinterpreted the defendant’s actions as “chasing”. The witness said he did not believe he had misinterpreted the situation. He agreed the incident happened very quickly and was over in “a couple of minutes”. Ms Powell then suggested her client’s car was “surrounded” by youths. The teeanger said that was not the case. Questioned about what happened to the BMW’s wing mirror, he replied: “I did not see anyone do anything to the wing mirror.” The trial continues.

But under the hundred-watt smile, Charlie was mired in darkness, and took his own le in March , before the programme was broadcast. Charlie, a student, was just . He had struggled with his mental health since losing his mother to cancer when he was .His heartbroken twin brother Harry, , has established the Charlie Watkins Foundation to raise awareness about mental health and funds to support young people who are suffering from mental illness.Two years after his death, Harry has written an emotional open letter, published below, about the saddest day of his le and what he would give to see his brother just one more time.   Dear Charlie, It feels strange to write a letter to you now, although it is somewhat therapeutic. I used to think that I knew what you were thinking, yet it is clear to me now that I never truly knew. It is obvious that I did not know of the demons you were battling in your head, or what you were forced to do next. It has been two years since the saddest day of my le.  The day I will never forget, chiselled in my mind like a mason takes to stone, and there it will remain. It serves me not as an infliction of pain, but as a reminder of the work I have to do in your name. Even though you may no longer be with us, your name lives on. The Charlie Watkins Foundation is a symbol, for all those who struggle with the same fight which you so bravely struggled with alone, to show them that there is hope and most importantly, solace.    There is not a day that goes past where I donapost think of you. Watching films we’d seen, eating at restaurants where we’d gone to, and even going to the pub where you so often forgot to take your wallet. What I would give now to buy you one more pint is immeasurable. It is not often someone at the age of  can say that they have lost a brother, furthermore a twin.    It is a connection that is like no other. I constantly feel like there is something missing from my le. I took for granted the bond we shared. I never said I loved you enough or actually admitted you were the quite good-looking brother who had a certain way with words. I lived in awe of your speedy wit and ability to understand a joke a lot quicker than me. I still replay some of your jokes in my head, having a private laugh every now and then.    To be honest, I still donapost quite understand one or two of them. Then again, we always knew who the smarter brother was. Upon undertaking work for the Charlie Watkins Foundation, it became clear that there was a problem out there, and not a small one either. I hadnapost realised that suicide is the biggest killer of men under the age of . How did I not know this  I assumed it was potentially my ignorance, but upon further investigation and talking to friends I realised that they too were none the wiser.  Why is there such a stigma surrounding mental health  If it was cancer or dementia, Iaposm sure everyone would be talking about it. This brought us, the foundation, to one of our key questions and goals. How do we get people to talk about mental health without being scared to do so  This is why we designed Chat with Charlie in your name. It is an online chat-room. A place where students can turn when they are struggling. Hopefully we will be able to spread this nationwide, helping as many as possible. If only there was something like this for you when you were suffering. Charlie, I will never forget you but will learn to cope with living without you. I will carry your memory with me always, as I do with mumaposs. I so often think about what you would be doing now.    What job you would have, where you would live, and what beautul girlfriend you would no doubt have. Sadly though, these are things I will have to leave to the imagination. Take happiness darling brother, knowing that there is always a place in my heart for you to reside, as I know the case to be true with so many others. I wish you eternal love and peace.

Mum-of-one Stephanie Housley, , is seen having a laugh with her brother Simon in the mobile phone snap. But she was tragically found dead on a stretch of the A between Meir and Meir Park in Staffordshire on Monday, March . Simon admits that his incredible sister had been battling inner demons before she tragically passed away. He has urged people to spend as much time as possible making memories with their loved ones before it is too late.He told StokeonTrentLive : I was looking through my phone and found the last photo of us together. There should have been more photos before this one, and there should have been many more to come but it aptly summarises how we were - enjoying a drink and having a great laugh together. He continued: The last few days have been particularly dficult for myself. In this photo you can see two people who look like theyaposre enjoying le to the full, but unfortunately what you see is two people who have battled their own inner demons for a long, long time. It is absolutely agonising for me to realise and I am still yet to come to terms that my sister unfortunately lost her battle on Monday night. The overwhelming feelings for me for the past few days have been regret and guilt. Although I have struggled with my own personal battle for many years, I feel that I was not there enough when she needed me through the bad moments, and that I also didnapost create anywhere near enough happy memories with the wonderful sister I was blessed with. There is nothing I can do about that now, but I offer the following advice: spend more time with your family and friends. Tell them that you love them. Tell them this more often. Nobody knows what le is going to throw their way and we need to make sure every single moment is as precious as the last. He has urged those suffering from mental health problems to seek help. He added: Mental health problems are publicised and spoken about all the time, but you wouldnapost think this in the way you see a lot of people interact with each other on a daily basis.  Be kind to strangers and acquaintances no one at any point can ever be fully aware of what is going on in someone aposs head. One simple kind act or gesture could go a long way for another person, who for all you know could be teetering on the edge. Never tell anyone to aposget on with itapos, aposdeal with itapos, aposman upapos or the like, you have no idea what is going on in their own mind. There may be an incredible weight that they are carrying and you are only piling on the pressure. Be a good person, and reflect this in how you talk to and behave with others that one kind act that you may see as insignicant may turn around another personaposs entire day, week or month. Every single second since we found out on Monday night has been absolutely devastating for our family, and while there is nothing that can be done to change what happened, you can make a dference from today onwards. And in a direct message to Steph, Simon added: I never spent anywhere near enough time with you and was never there for you enough. I want you to know that you were an incredible sister and I would do anything to have you back. You were an amazing daughter and an absolutely wonderful mother. Rest assured that we will all come together to ensure your daughter grows up to become an amazing woman just like yourself.

The couple announced their happy news as they arrived in Australia ahead of their -day royal tour back in October. Over the past few months theyaposve shared a few sweet updates about their unborn child, but as is the case with all royal pregnancies lots of the details are being kept a secret. So what exactly do we know about the new Royal Baby so far  Hereaposs everything you need to know about the most talked about pregnancy this year.    When is the Royal Baby due  We donapost know exactly when Baby Sussex is due to arrive. As it traditional with royal babies, Meghan and Harry have chosen to keep the due date to themselves. However the Duchess has told well-wishers sheaposs due around April. If she has it in a hospital, the first sign weaposll have that the baby is on its way is when parking restriction signs go up outside. Is it a girl or a boy  Meghan and Harry say they donapost know the gender of their baby, telling well-wishers they wanted to keep it a surprise.

Bookies have odds at   each - so none the wiser there! Is Meghan having twins  Right from the start many people have been convinced we could have not one, but two royal babies. Bookies have offs of around   on Royal twins - how exciting! What will the Royal Baby be called  If they follow in Kate and Williamaposs footsteps, the couple will keep us guessing for a few days before they announce the name. Bookies Betway is listing Diana as its favourite with odds sitting at  .  Up next is Victoria at   followed by Alice at   and Elizabeth at  . There two names in the running for boys, with Albert and Phillip both at  . Arthur and James are next, both at  . Will Meghan get maternity leave  Yes. Just like every other mum Meghan is legally entitled to some time off with her baby. Sheaposs already completed her final public engagement - the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey - but sheaposs continuing with private meetings and events. Where will the baby fall in the line of succession  Seventh in line. The baby will bump Harryaposs uncle the Duke of York into eighth place in the line of succession. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie move into ninth and th place, and the Earl of Wessex - the Queenaposs youngest son - drops out of the top  for the first time to th in line.    Where is Meghan having the baby  Kate had three successful deliveries at the private Lindo Wing in St Maryaposs Hospital, Paddington, so Meghan might follow her sister-in-lawaposs lead. Harry was also born there in . It is close to Kensington Palace and well practiced at dealing with royal births, and the publicity surrounding them. But many royal expects believe Meghan will pick somewhere dferent to have her baby.    The couple will probably be living in their new Windsor home when the baby arrives, so they may want something a bit closer. Where will the Royal Baby live  Baby Sussex will live at Harry and Meghanaposs new home - Frogmore Cottage. It has undergone a huge renovation ahead ready so make it the perfect family home. How will the baby be related to the Queen  The baby will be a great-grandchild of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Walesaposs grandchild and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs niece or nephew.    Will the baby be a prince or princess  No, they will not be a prince nor a princess , nor an HRH because George V limited titles within the Royal Family in . Will he or she ever be monarch  Unlikely. The baby will have three cousins Prince George - a future king - and Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, who are further up the line of succession, so it is a safe bet that throne will stay on the Cambridge side of the family.  So what will their title be  A son would be known as Earl of Dumbarton - because a first son of a duke is allowed to use one of his fatheraposs other lesser titles as a courtesy title. Harry was also made the Earl of Dumbarton on the morning of his wedding, as well as being given a dukedom. A daughter would be LadyMountbatten-Windsor. But the Queen could change this  Yes. The Queen stepped in ahead of Georgeaposs birth to issue a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridgesapos children had fitting titles, but this royal baby is much further down the line of succession.  Will Harry and Meghan hire a nanny  Most likely. Harry has been close to all his nannies and it is likely he and Meghan will arrange for a nanny to care for their baby while they are on official engagements. Kate and William have the help of their full-time live-in nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo. Meghanaposs close friend Jessica Mulroney had two nannies to help her with her twin boys and younger daughter. Will the baby have dual citizenship  Harry and Meghan could apply for their child to have dual US-UK citizenship. Meghan is planning to become a British citizen - but it is not known whether she will hold dual nationality, and at present is still a US citizen.

This is a milestone moment for all parents, but for adoptive mum Paula itaposs extra special. Doctors said that four-year-old Tony may never walk due to the brutal abuse he suffered at the hands of his birth parents. At just  days old, Tony was hours from death after being tortured by Jody Simpson, , and Tony Smith, , who were later jailed.Tony suffered multiple organ failure, numerous fractures and  sepsis  and doctors battled for six weeks to save him.The baby was so badly injured that he later had to have both legs amputated below the knee. But that horror is hard to imagine when you look at the smiling, robust little boy wriggling off his mumaposs lap to try out his new Spiderman-themed prosthetic legs. Here, Paula tells their story in her own words.   I can do it mum, I can do it, Tony says as I try to secure his prosthetics before he wriggles off my knee. Seeing him run on his new legs now towards the playground, it’s hard to imagine how close to death he was less than four years ago. He was such a broken little boy when I first met him in hospital. My husband Mark and I were looking to foster a child at the time so we went to see Tony. We were told that he had been poorly but when nurses showed me photos of his injuries I just broke down and cried.  The injuries were horric, his whole body was bruised and he had a hole in his nose. I sat down by his hospital bed and when he opened his eyes he just melted my heart. I rang my husband and said, aposthis is not going to be easy, itaposs going to be a lot of work and our family will never be the same again. But I canapost leave him. When we took him home two days later he looked so fragile in his little car seat. I thought aposwhat have we done bringing such a poorly little boy into our boisterous family apos  But we never wrapped Tony up in cotton wool and he just got on with things. His progress has been incredible. He is proof that all a child needs is love and care to thrive. Nothing stops him now. He’s really fast getting around and he’s caught up cognitively with all his peers. He is very determined. The strength of his will has pulled him through. And these new prosthetics will hopefully be the start of his next phase of growth. Heaposs never been able to walk so we didnapost know how stable he would be.  But he mastered that walking action very quickly so we remain optimistic. Tonyaposs bones are still in a mess after the abuse he suffered. One leg is shorter than the other and when you see him next to other children you really notice how short his thigh bones are. But heaposs using his legs really nicely so weaposre keeping everything crossed. Doctors said that Tony was born in the right era. Medicine and technology are progressing all the time.  In  years, Tony will be , and there should be amazing advancements in prosthetics by then. Theyaposve designed these prosthetics specially for him in Luton. Theyaposre broader at the bottom so theyaposre very stable and have anti-slip rubber on the soles to make it easier for him to learn. Tony loves the playground but he usually has to go down the slide head first. He can tip overhe goes legs-first because all his weight and strength are in his top half but now he can do it with the prosthetics.    The old prosthetics were cumbersome. These have additional layers of lycra which hold his skin more tightly. And heaposll be able to pull up the shorts that attach to the legs on his own. He likes pirates, so he has another pair being sent next week with a skull and cross bones printed on them. Practicing on the prosthetics can be hard work. Heaposs so fast getting around without them that using them can be an inconvenience. Sometimes he says he doesnapost want to do it.    He canapost see the long-term plan, that practicing now could mean that in the future he can walk and stand with his friends. But hopefully this is the start of a new le for him. And Tonyaposs experience may now help to change the law around sentencing for child cruelty. The maximum sentence that can be given for injuring a child is currently  years - thataposs the sentence his birth parents got. And the maximum sentence for killing a child is  years. We want to see those sentences increased and to be brought into line with adult GBH, manslaughter and murder so that a le sentence can be given for injuring or killing children.    Our MP, Tom Tugendhat has been fantastic and he is really pushing to get this bill through. Why should sentences be lower for injuring or killing a vulnerable child  It makes no sense. Tonyaposs Law could change that. Tom is meeting the Justice Minister to see where they can go with the bill now. It was emotional hearing Tom announce that it would be called Tonyaposs Law in the House of Commons.

Warm air is set to blow in from the Azores in the mid-Atlantic and push temperatures about  degrees warmer than normal for this time of year, some forecasts claim. Temperatures will hit the mid-teens and there is a small chance they could rise to almost C in London, East Anglia or Lincolnshire, it is claimed. Regardless, forecasters say it will feel much warmer than recently because strong winds that battered the UK for days, along with torrential rain and snow in the north, have finally eased.    Flooding remains a threat in some places. As of Tuesday morning there were  flood warnings and  alerts in England, and three warnings in Wales. Northern Ireland has already had its wettest March on record, breaking the old mark of .mm, and parts of North West England, including Rochdale in Greater Manchester, have already seen twice as much rain as usual for this time of year. After a foggy start in some places, Tuesday will bring patchy light rain and drizzle in the west and a few showers in eastern England, the Met Office said. There will be some bright spells, particularly in the east, and it will be windy in northern Scotland.    Patchy rain will continue to fall in the north and west overnight and further patches of fog are likely in central and southeast England into Wednesday morning. Wednesday - the first day of spring - will be dry and largely cloudy for many but patchy rain is likely to fall over western hills and costs, the Met Office said. Warm bright spells are expected across the south and east. For the rest of the week, it will be largely dry, cloudy and warm on Thursday, when it could hit C. Some forecasts claim it could hit C in in London, East Anglia or Lincolnshirethere is a prolonged period of sunshine.  However, a band of rain in the north will gradually move south through Friday and Saturday. Cooler and showery weather are likely from Sunday. Meteorologist Greg Dewhurst told the Express: “High pressure will be in charge for the rest of the week although weather systems will skirt across northern parts of the UK bringing fresher conditions to parts. “Temperatures will rise through the week with highs of C likely on Thursday as tropical maritime air comes into the UK from the Azores. “It looks like high pressure will hopefully dominate this weekend and into next week and it will stay mostly dry through the rest of March although windy in the north-west.  Meteorologist John West said : We saw quite a lot of rain in western areas over the last few days, which helps to top up river levels. On Saturday, we recorded about half a monthaposs rainfall for parts of Wales. We got about -mm of rain within a  to -hour period. Mr West said temperatures could rise to the mid-teens by the end of the week. He added: Thereaposs certainly going to be a bit of an improvement. [It will] jump up by Tuesday with highs of  in the south-east. We will probably hang on to those temperatures in the mid-teens, we could see  or  as we go through the back end of the week. Is my area under a flood warning or alert   Dozens of flood warnings and alerts were in place on Tuesday morning. The Environment Agency said it had installed temporary flood barriers and was operating flood defences to keep communities safe. Information about flood warnings and alerts is posted on Government websites. England: The latest flood warnings from the Environment Agency are posted on this website. Northern Ireland: A strategic flood map from the Rivers Agency is available on this website. Scotland: The Scottish Environment Protection Agency website has live flooding information. Wales: A live flood warning map is on this Natural Resources Wales website. Met Office five-day forecast Tuesday Largely cloudy skies, perhaps some patchy fog at first. Patchy light rain and drizzle lingering in the west and a few showers in eastern England. Some bright spells are possible, particularly in the east. Windy in north Scotland. Milder. Tuesday night Mostly cloudy tonight with low cloud shrouding the hills in places. Patchy rain continuing in the north and west, but dry where. Fog patches possible in central and southeast England.  Wednesday Dry and largely cloudy for many on Wednesday. However, patchy rain is likely over western hills and coasts. Some warm bright spells developing, particularly across the south and east. Thursday to Saturday Some rain in Scotland Thursday, but largely dry, cloudy and warm where. Band of rain in the north gradually sinking south through Friday and Saturday followed by cooler, showery weather. Bright and sunny weather on the way  Here is what the Met Office has to say in its outlook for Saturday  March to Monday  April: Confidence is low for this weekend, but it looks sunny for many, once patchy rain in the south clears. There will be some blustery showers in the northwest though, with the risk of gales in the far north. Through the latter stages of March, we will see a good deal of dry weather across central and southeastern parts of the UK, with bright or sunny spells. It will be more changeable across the northwest, with rain and strong winds from time to time. Temperatures are most likely to be around the average for the time of year, although some warmer periods are likely in the southeast when the sun shines. However, occasionally in the northwest it may be rather cold. April to be wet and windy Wet and windy weather is expected after a settled start to April. The Met Officeaposs outlook for Tuesday  April to Tuesday  April says: For the start of April, changeable conditions are likely, with near normal temperatures across the UK. Thereafter, the forecast looks more uncertain, but it seems most likely that we will see changeable conditions across the UK once again. Wet and windy weather may be interspersed with drier and brighter spells, with the most unsettled conditions still probable in the north. By the middle of the month, we may see aof more widely settled weather. Temperatures could potentially start off a little warmer than average, but they may fall nearer to the seasonal average for a time in early April.

And the New Zealand mosque terror attacks was no dferent, with accounts of heroism, self-sacrice and acts of forgiveness, despite the unimaginable pain. The country’s Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, has also inspired the world with her heartfelt and immediate response to the tragedy. Aged just , her compassionate and heart-felt reaction, has seen her mourn with grieving relatives of the  victims of Friday’s gun massacre. And footage of her holding them, wearing a scarf over her head as a mark of respect, have rendered meaningless -year-old Brenton Tarrant’s own gesture of flashing a white power sign during his court appearance.    Praise for the party leader, who has been in office for nearly  months has been unanimous as she promised to cover funeral costs, provide financial support for families affected and change gun laws. Cristina Nicolotti, Sky News’ director of content, tweeted: “I’ve been incredibly impressed with the compassion, composure and determination shown by Jacinda Ardern in this dreadful crisis. “UK politicians take note.” Sharon Thompson, Labour councillor of North Edgbaston, said the New Zealand PM “has shown the world what true leadership can look like. “Empathy, understanding, action and unity - I applaud this woman for her compassion and not being afraid to lead NZ with real love.” And Islamic Theologian and Scholar Dr Yasir Qadhi spoke for many Muslims around the world when he wrote: “What a noble leader Jacinda Ardern is! A true role model for our times. I might not have known your name before… but you have forever won our respect, and the respect of millions around the globe.”    Within hours of the shooting on Friday morning, the Kiwi leader was already at work to bring her country together and reassure Muslims of their place in her society. “They are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not,” she said in a moving statement. And she used the same language to speak to the killer, pointing out the New Zealand is made up of people of more than  ethnicities and  languages whose values would not be shaken by the murders. “You may have chosen us - we utterly reject and condemn you,” she said.  The next day she went to Christchurch, taking with her the leaders of all political parties, not just her own. Images of her on the verge of tears, consoling victims’ relatives and hugging the grieving, flew around the world. One photo, in particular, went viral - dressed in a hijab, her face a picture of grief as she listened during a meeting with Christchurch’s Muslim community. And she was seen hugging sobbing relatives tightly and holding their hands outside the city’s Kilbernie mosque, before laying flowers and paying her own tribute to victims at a makesht memorial.    But onlookers have also seen her uncompromising side, in particular in rebuttals she has made to Donald Trump. When asked during a press conference on Saturdayshe agreed with the US presidentaposs comment that he doesn’t see white nationalism as a rising threat, she answered simply: “No.” She also noted that Trump was among the international leaders who called to offer support, saying: “He very much wished for his condolences to be passed on to New Zealand. He asked what support the US could provide. My message was sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.” When she was asked how Trump responded, she said: “He acknowledged that and agreed.” And markedly unlike Trump, rather than simply offering thoughts and prayers she has vowed to ban semi-automatic weapons in the country, saying: “I can tell you one thing right now: Our gun laws will change.” While it took a tragedy for Ms Ardern to come to the attention of many around the world, she has long been seen as an impressive and compassionate leader in New Zealand. She became the youngest sitting MP in Parliament after being elected in  aged just .  The daughter of a veteran New Zealand police officer, she began her career working as a researcher in the office of the then-Prime Minister Helen Clark. She then volunteered in a soup kitchen in New York, before spending three years in the UK as a policy advisor of British PM Tony Blair . Her rise to become New Zealand’s th PM was so meteoric it was dubbed Jacindamania. In March  she was unanimously elected deputy leader of the Labour Party, before taking over as leader in August, then running in - and winning  - the country’s general election the following month. Aged just , she was the youngest Prime Minister in New Zealand for  years. And in office she continued to show that leadership could be dferent.  In her maiden speech, she referred to herself as a social democrat who believes strongly in the values of human rights, social justice, equality, and democracy, and the role of communities. Among many other issues, she is a big advocate of climate change, wants to reduce poverty and homelessness in the country, give young New Zealanders free tertiary education and decriminalise abortion. Known as a frugal leader, soon after she was elected she froze MPs salaries and insisted that her ministers use carpools to get to events. Last year she became only the second world leader in history to give birth while in office - the first was Pakistan’s late two-time PM Benazir Bhutto. By coincidence, at  she was the same age as Bhutto, and gave birth to baby Neve Te Aroha on exactly the same day, June , as the Pakistani leader did  years earlier. New Zealanders were so excited about the birth of her baby hundreds knitted boots and hats, and volunteered for babysitting service, as her due date grew closer.  In September Ms Ardern made history again by becoming the first female leader to attend the United Nations general assembly with her baby in tow. She even played with her three-month-old daughter before giving a speech at the Nelson Mandela peace summit, and while she spoke her partner and stay-at-home dad Clarke Gayford held the baby on his lap. Ms Arden insisted on paying for Clarke’s tickets to New York and other expenses out of her own pocket. Clarke posted a photo on Twitter on Monday of Neve’s security pass, which read “first baby”. He added: “I wish I could have captured the startled look on a Japanese delegation inside UN yesterday who walked into a meeting room in the middle of a nappy change. Great yarn for her st .” Asked by the Today show on the US NBC networkit was harder to govern New Zealand or take her daughter on a -hour flight, Ardern responded with a laugh and said, “it felt at the time on par, adding that she had apologised to her fellow passengers in advance.  And she said she hoped she could help pave the way for other women to be able to work and raise children at the same time. She said: “If I can do one thing, and that is change the way we think about these things, then I will be pleased we have achieved something.” Ms Ardern has also impressed many with her commitment to a kind and more empathetic politics, shown by her refusal to capitalise on mistakes made by opposition leader Simon Brides. She has also been honest about mistakes and shows a willingness to be held to account, an attitude which has led some to criticise her for showing “weakness”. But Dr Claire Timperley, a political scientist at Victoria University believes they are misguided.  She said: “She is putting her neck out by saying ‘I want to claim kindness’ - kindnesses can also be interpreted as weaknesses. “I think she is being very intentional in trying to change the language around leadership, and saying actually you can be kind and you can also be strong.” Through the heartbreaking events of last week, Ms Ardern confounded her critics and showed the world that compassion and kindness can make for strong and bold leadership, something many around the world wish their own leaders would aspire to. The feeling was summed up by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, which said in an editorial: “Ardern is a leader for our times, and we should follow her example.” "},{"url":null,"title":"inside bunga bunga parties brought","story":"NewsInside Bunga Bunga parties that brought down a PM and now linked to models deathDozens of women who attend Silvio Berlusconi would throw debauched bashes which ended with the then Italy PM choosing which one to have sex withShareByMatt Roper:,  MAR NewsFormer escort Nadia Macri , implicated in alleged sexual scandals with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey were the lavish sex parties that became so infamous they even spawned a new word in the dictionary. Silvio Berlusconi coined the term ‘bunga bunga’ to describe the debauched soirees he would throw at his private villa, where young women performed raunchy dancers and strip for him. But when the parties, and allegations that some of the girls were underage, blew up in public the scandal led to the then Italian prime minister being jailed and banned from public office for le. The billionaire media mogul had his sentence quashed a year later on appeal. But bunga bunga could now come back to haunt Belusconi after authorities launched a murder investigation following the mysterious death of a model who was a regular guest at the parties and one of the main witnesses in his trial.    Moroccan Imane Fadil, , died on March  in a Milan hospital, a month after being admitted with stomach pains and telling staff she had been poisoned. Italy’s media have reported she may have been poisoned with a radioactive substances, while Milan’s chief prosecutor said there are “several anomalies” in her medical records. Ms Fadil, who told Berlusconi’s trial that young women wore nun’s costumes and stripped off while performing raunchy pole dances, was writing a book after her experiences at the bunga bunga parties with more potentially explosive revelations, according to reports. Until now Berlusconi, who served as Italian PM in four governments and, once owned football club AC Milan and who owns the country’s largest commercial broadcaster, may have thought he had escaped the sex scandal relatively unscathed. Commenting on Ms Fadil’s death, he continued to deny her claims that she attended his parties or that he paid women for sex. He said: “It’s always a pity when a young person dies. I never met this person, never talked to her. “What I read of her statements made me think that everything was invented, absurd.”    The secretive bunga bunga sessions first came to light in October , when Berlusconi personally phoned a police station asking for the release of a -year-old girl, Karima el-Mahroug, who had been accused of stealing a ,-euro bracelet. He wrongly told them that the girl was the niece of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. In fact the teenager was a Moroccan nightclub dancer and prostitute who called herself Ruby the Heart Stealer. Berlusconi, prosecutors later claimed, was terried police questioning her would find out that underage Ruby had been attending the ‘bunga bunga’ parties held at his palatial home, Villa San Martino, in Arcore, a small town outside of Milan. Following the phone call officers released her into the care of one of the prime minister’s associates, Nicole Minetti, a member of Berlusconi’s party who also pimped for the mogul and performed explicit lesbian floorshows in a nun’s costume. She took Ruby back to a flat she shared with a Brazilian prostitute, Michelle Conceicao, who was also later linked with Berlusconi after it was found she called him on his mobile phone while he was attending a summit in Paris.  But when prosecutors found out about PM’s intervention in her arrest, they began an investigation would culminate in one of the country’s most sensational trials. It was Ruby who first introduced the term ‘bunga bunga’, which she said was a lap-dancing competition in which the winner or winners got to sleep with Berlusconi. In an interview with prosecutor Antonio Sangermano soon after the police station incident, she claimed Berlusconi had sent a limo to her home to take her to the villa for the first time on Valentine’s Day . She said: “That evening Berlusconi explained to me that bunga bunga consisted of a harem that he copied from his friend Gaddafi , in which the girls take their clothes off and have to provide physical pleasures.” While Berlusconi never denied inviting women to his lavish parties, he always claimed they were “convivial” dinners with food, laughter and jokes, after which he would sometimes give them money because he was “generous” and wanted to help them.  But as more women came forward with lurid details of what would happen at the private bashes the case transfixed and shocked Italians. Prosecution documents listed the names of  young women, mostly would-be starlets hoping to break into showbusiness on one of Berlusconi’s television channels, who said were paid to have sex with him at the parties. They described how the parties always followed the same script, and ended with the prime minister choosing one of the girls to spent the night with. First, they said, came dinner, a meal often composed of foods in the red, white and green of Italy’s tricolor flag. Then followed what has become known as the ‘bunga bunga’ session, “which took place in a disco-like room where the female participants engaged in dressing up, striptease and erotic dances, touching each other or touching and being touched in their intimate parts by Silvio Berlusconi. Finally, at the end of the evening, -year-old Berlusconi would choose “one or more women with whom he spent the night in an intimate relationship, in exchange for money, expensive gts or rent-free apartments.  Some of the most eye-opening accounts of what happened at the mogul’s mansion came from Ambra Battilana and Chiara Danese, two women who had been wooed to a bunga bunga party with promises of jobs on Berlusconi’s TV channel. Ms Battilana said: Fteen minutes after we’d sat down, some of the girls uncovered their breasts, offering them to Berlusconi so he could kiss them. “They also touched the prime minister’s intimate parts and made him touch theirs. “While this was happening, the girls were still singing “thank goodness for Silvio!” and calling the prime minister “Papi” and Berlusconi called all of us “my little girls, my little girls. And Ms Danese claimed the PM asked women to kill the penis of a statue. She said: “After the umpteenth obscene joke, Berlusconi brings in a statue, it’s in a kind of case.From it emerges a little man with a huge penis. The statuette is the size of a half-litre bottle of water. Its penis is disproportionately big. “Berlusconi begins passing it around among the girls. And he asks them to kiss the penis. They kiss it and simulate oral sex with it, or they approach him with bared breasts. They all laugh. “At a certain point, the prime minister, visibly content, asks: “Are you ready for bunga bunga ” The girls shout together: “Yessss!!!” The police investigation also used wiretaps of women’s phones to get evidence of what happened during the secretive soirees. In the transcript of one call, party guest Maria Makdoum told how she did a belly dance in the ‘bunga bunga’ room while a pair of twin sisters, dressed in bra and panties, danced around “in a hard-core way” before Berlusconi and another male guest. “The other girls also danced, showing their breasts and their bottoms and they all went near the prime minister who touched them in their intimate parts,” she said.  In another leaked transcript Dario ‘Lele’ Mora - a TV impresario accused with others of procuring prostitutes for the premier - asked one woman: “Do you have a nurse’s outfit  Go get one today,” adding that she should wear nothing underneath except white suspenders for a “private health visit.” He was one of three Berlusconi aides accused of being part of a “vast pimping network” to attend bunga bunga parties with the prime minister. Police also tapped the calls of women to Berlusconi himself, some of which were leaked to Italian media. In a blow to Berlusconi’s self-cultivated ‘macho’ image, some of the women who allegedly slept with him for money complain that he is getting old, fat and flabby and should just ‘cough up’ or they will start stealing from his house. Others, speaking to him on the phone, call him ‘love’ before asking for more cash. Testying at the trial, Imane Fadil - the woman who died this month - said the parties involved young women, sometimes in pairs, wearing nuns’ costumes and stripping off while performing raunchy pole dances. She said: “They started to dance like the nuns of the film ‘Sister Act’ and then they took off their clothes.” At another party, a woman in her underwear stripped for Berlusconi wearing a mask with the face of footballer Ronaldinho, she said. Karima el-Mahroug, the girl known as Ruby whose arrest first sparked the investigation, also testied at the trial, claiming she first met Berlusconi when she was invited to a dinner party at his private village outside of Milan on Valentines Day  aged . She said the parties took place in a disco in Berlusconiaposs villa equipped with a lap dancing pole, where women danced and stripped down to their underwear. She said she also saw women dressed as then-US president Barack Obama or as a Milan magistrate who is leading the prosecution against Berlusconi in the sex scandal, wearing the red wig and black robes worn by magistrates in Italy. The girls who were dressed in costumes approached him in a sensual way as they danced. They raised their skirts, El-Mahroug testied, claiming the bunga bunga sessions soon turned into orgies among male and female guests.  But she denied sleeping with the frisky politician, claiming: “It’s the first time in my le that a man has not tried to take me to bed. He behaved like a father, I swear.” And she said he only gave her , euros after a party because she had told him she was in trouble. However in leaked wiretaps of her telephone conversations, however, she told friends that Berlusconi had offered to “cover her in gold” to keep quiet, and that she had demanded  million euros. Mobile phone records placed her at the Arcore villa  times between February and May .  In June  he was found guilty of paying for sex with an underage prostitute and of abusing his office, and was sentenced to seven years in prison and banned from holding public office for le. However, judges in Milan overturned the conviction on appeal last July, saying the facts of the case aposdid not constitute a crime.apos Berlusconi must have wished that would have been the end of talk of his infamous parties. But the untimely and suspicious death of one of the models at the centre of attempts to convict him could prove to be the biggest bunga bunga scandal of them all.  "},{"url":null,"title":"ruth maguire mystery surrounds tragic","story":"NewsRuth Maguire: Mystery final moments of mum who vanished and died after hen partyMum-of-three Ruth Maguire, , went missing as the hen party group left a pub in Carlingford, County Louth, IrelandShareCommentsByElaine McCahillAssistant News Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsThe missing mum was found dead \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMystery surrounds the final movements of a young mum who went missing after a hen party and drowned in a nearby lough.

CCTV footage showed Agnese Klavina, , appeared to be forced into Westley Capper’s Mercedes S before he drove off with pal Craig Porter, judges were told at the start of the Britsapos kidnap trial. Both have denied unlawful detention. Police investigating the mysterious disappearance said they categorised it as potentially “high-risk” from the start and arrested the Brits after discovering Miss Klavina was last seen leaving Aqwa Mist nightspot, in the upmarket resort of Puerto Banus, with them. Her phone stopped emitting a signal around five hours later, said police, who have been unable to locate her more than four years on.  Essex-born Capper, , and Porter,  could be sentenced to up to  years in prisonconvicted of unlawful detention. They took the witness stand at Malaga’s Audiencia Provincial court to deny “making Agnese disappear” or disposing of her body at sea. The Latvian-born waitress spent several years living in London before moving to the Costa del Sol around six months before she disappeared in the early hours of September , . A three-page state prosecution indictment submitted to the court ahead of the start of the trial on Monday claims the Brit pair asked Miss Klavina to accompany them to Capper’s home on the exclusive El Madronal residential estate a -minute drive from Aqwa Mist.  Prosecutor Maria del Carmen Tirado Galvez added in the indictment: “Westley George Capper took advantage of the fact she was under the effects of alcohol and and her intellectual and volitive faculties were affected and led her to his Mercedes S AMG car. “Agnese caused a fuss as she was led from the door of the nightclub to the car and showed she didn’t want to accompany the accused. “Despite this Westley George Capper put her into the vehicle which he was driving, while Craig Ian Porter who was in the passenger seat was waiting inside. “Agnese tried to get out of the car once she was inside but was prevented from doing so by the accused who then sped off towards El Madronal, both of them retaining Agnese Klavina against her will. “Since then there has been no news of her and the accused have not offered any information on her whereabouts.”  Capper, wearing a white shirt and black trousers in court, admitted drinking beer and vodka and taking drugs the night Miss Klavina vanished. But he insisted under oath she got into his car “willingly” after they met in the club and agreed to go back to his home to carry on partying despite failing to persuade a girlfriend she was with to accompany them. He refused to answer questions from lawyers acting for Miss Klavina’s family, but told the state prosecutor he was holding her by the waist as they left Aqwa Mist because she was “drunk and staggering. Private-school educated Capper said he dropped Miss Klavina off near a roundabout around three minutes drive from his home after she told him: “Stop here, I’ve changed my mind, I want to go home, this is where I live.” Prosecutor Maria del Carmen Tirado Galvez asked Capper during cross-examination: “Did you not think it’s strange that she wanted to be left at am in high heels more than two kilometres from her home ” Capper replied: “It was a well-lit area and I knew the turning near where I dropped her was full of houses. She said that’s where her house was and I didn’t know at the time she lived any further.”  He also insisted a number of  calls from his phone the morning Miss Klavina disappeared were made by accident and said he made repeated calls to a British friend called Paul Farmer who was questioned but never charged to try to buy drugs off him. Police records show he called his pal’s phone  times between .am and .am before ringing him repeatedly later the same morning. Asked about a suitcase and a carpet seen being taken onto Capper’s boat four days after Agnese’s disappearance when it was boarded by four men including the two defendants, he said: “I wasn’t carrying a carpet. I was carrying a case but it had clothes in it and bedding for the boat because I was planning to go to Ibiza for the closing parties.” Porter, the first of the two men to take the witness stand, insisted he fell asleep in the passenger seat on the ride home to Capper’s house and only discovered Miss Klavina was no longer with them when they reached his friendaposs home. Asked by his defence lawyer Inmaculada Garciahe intended to have sex with Miss Klavina, he answered No” and said the only reason he did not go straight home despite being “drunk and tired” was because he did not want to wake his we and children. He admitted to going out to sea on his pal’s boat Geofil II from Puerto de la Duquesa near Gibraltar on September , .  His defence lawyer asked him: “On that day did you or anyone you were with dispose of Agnese’s body ” Porter replied: “No.” Porter admitted to seeing missing posters shortly after Miss Klavina vanished but insisted he had never looked at them properly and could not remember what she had looked like. Aqwa Mist doorman Siani Ousmane, who is accused of being an accessory to the Brits’ alleged crime only by prosecutors for Miss Klavina’s family, told the court he had been asked to throw the pair out of the club by his boss because they were causing problems but insisted the missing woman never asked for his help. He described Miss Klavina as a regular at the nightclub. He insisted he only opened the Mercedes car door for Porter in the hope of a tip to supplement his meagre  euroa night wage - and said the missing blonde got in the vehicle herself and he did not push her in. A National Police investigator, referred to in court only by his service number  and not his name, said Miss Klavina had a steady job and friends and had given no indication she was unhappy. He told the court: “The CCTV footage we obtained from the nightclub showed she did not appear to be acting with her full will.

However, disruption for road users is expected as a result of the closure.Diversions could redirect traffic on to nearby Dundee Road, where drivers can rejoin Claypotts Road at its southernmost point and continue their journeys on the A.Ferry councillor Craig Duncan said he welcomed the move to link up the two parks.The works bear a similarity to a project to do the same across the Kingsway at Caird Park, which is almost complete.Mr Duncan said: “It looks as though it will link up the two parks. It can be tricky crossing there when you have kids or dogs.“It’ll be good to join them up in a safe way and I’m looking forward to them going in.”The works are the second major project to impact Arbroath Road users in less than  months.The pothole-pocked road was closed for two weeks last July for signicant resurfacing works.Similarly, the latest set of works will take place during the spring school holidays.Mr Duncan added: “There is never an excellent time to do roadworks but they have tried to do these at a time when they are least likely to have an impact on a lot of people, which is to be commended.”Elsewhere in Dundee, another street is set to close for two weeks during the spring holidays for the installation of a second pedestrian crossing.Old Glamis Road south of the Kingsway will close between Balgray Street and Fairmuir Road starting on April  for pedestrian crossing works.That closure will impact on bus services, including Xplore Dundee’s  which will ert via Park Road, Strathmartine Road and Clepington Road before resuming its route towards the city centre.The service heading out of the city, towards Kirkton, will not be affected by the works."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss jim mcintyre keeping tabs on st mirren and hamilton","story":"Jim McIntyre admits he’ll be keeping a keen eye on how St Mirren and Hamilton are faring tomorrow ahead of his side’s clash with Celtic on Sunday.The Dark Blues will take on the league leaders following the Buddies’ trip to St Johnstone and Hamilton’s home clash with Hearts.In an ideal world, it would be all about focusing on themselves at Dens Park, as the manager has been keen to stress in recent weeks, but the nature of the three-way battle to avoid the drop means the Dark Blues can’t help but take notice of their rivals’ results.And Jim would be delighted to shock everybody, St Mirren and Accies included, by picking up a result against the Hoops this weekend.Jim said: “A big result against a big side would do wonders for confidence levels.“You have to look to pick up points against teams you’re not expected to.“That can also have an effect on others, as well as boosting yourselves.“I’ll go back to it, though – we can only worry about us.“Obviously we hope that other results go our way.“I’m not going to sit here and kid on I’m not.“There were a lot of positives against Hearts but we’ve lost the game and there are only so many times you can keep saying that.“We know we need to be better in the final third.”Jim isn’t expecting much of a change to Celtic from their last meeting, despite Neil Lennon replacing the departed Brendan Rodgers last month.“Why would you want to change what has been very successful ” he added.“I’m sure Neil will make subtle changes because every manager does that but the bottom line is their squad is still the same and they’ve still got top players.“We need a top performance to get anything out of the game.”Dundee are expected to be without striker Andrew Nelson but Craig Curran came through last week’s clash with Hearts unscathed after his stomach injury saw him miss the - defeat at Ibrox last Wednesday.Both Andy Dales and Scott Wright picked up knocks against the Jambos but nothing that will keep them out of Sunday’s clash."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss mcintyre refuses to blame referee for celtic loss after 96th minute goal","story":"Boss Jim McIntyre believes the six minutes of injury time played by Bobby Madden at Dens Park yesterday was too long.However, the Dundee gaffer refused to blame the referee for the heart-breaking loss to Celtic that came via an Odsonne Edouard strike in the final few seconds of that extra period.When he did finally blow for time, home supporters booed the whistler off the park and clearly believed he’d cost their team a point.For Jim, though, the failure to take an excellent opportunity to snatch victory just seconds earlier was the cause of his team’s agonising demise.That came when substitute Andy Dales shot straight at Hoops keeper Scott Bain from the edge of the area when a better option seemed to play a pass.It allowed Celtic to go up the park and capitalise on an error by home skipper Martin Woods and grab the winner.“I fail to see where six minutes comes from. I thought that was too much time added on but, having said that, it’s not the reason,” he said.“We had a great opportunity on the counter attack with two minutes to go and we’ve got to be better.“That’s the reason we are where we are because we’ve been going into so many good areas in each of the last few games and we’re not punishing teams.“We didn’t do what Celtic did. They were ruthless and that’s why we’ve not picked up enough points since I’ve come.“There has been plenty of positive play, plenty of areas we’ve got into but we need to be better in the final third.“It’s the only thing that’s going to get you out of the situation that you’re in – winning games.”Returning to Madden’s decision to play on for so long, Jim confirmed he had spoken to the referee to get his reasoning.“He said there were a couple of head knocks, so that was the reason why. It’s generally about three but there were a couple of knocks, so I could understand maybe four.

We can beat them in both of those games, we know we’re capable of that but we’d need to win all the other games as well.“What’s important is that we go on a winning run because that’s a massive thing going into the end of the season, whether you’re going for automatic promotion oryou are going to be in the play-offs.”The -year-old’s experience of the second tier tells him how dficult that’s going to be and,anything, he believes putting together a winning run this term is harder than it’s ever been.“I think when you look at the league right now you see that any time you’re playing, there is no guaranteed games you are going to win.“Everyone in the league has something to play for, whether it’s the teams up at the top or the ones down at the bottom.“I think this is one of the tightest seasons I’ve seen for a few years.”That view is backed up by the progress of today’s opponents.Until a five-game winning streak, the Pars were looking over their shoulders and worrying about being dragged into a relegation dogfight.Now they’re in a play-off spot and,they can make it six wins on the trot today, they’d be challenging United in the race for second place.That makes this game almost as vital as the looming clash with Ross County at Tannadice on Tuesday.Stanton knows he and his team-mates will have their work cut out today but stressed the aim is to maintain an unbeaten East End Park record that stretches back to .“As a club we’ve had a good record against Dunfermline and we want to keep that going.“They are on a good run right now but we believe we can go there and win.“If we do win this one we keep a gap to the teams below us.“That’s important but we just have to look to be winning games as often as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united win can put pressure on top dogs ross county","story":"Theof winter weather last weekend, and the raft of postponements it led to, has given Dundee United the chance to put some pressure on leaders Ross County when the Championship’s top two clash at Tannadice tonight.First to fall foul of the conditions was County’s Highland derby trip to Inverness Caley Thistle on Friday evening, that one going off because of a waterlogged pitch.Had it gone ahead, it would have provided the Staggies with the opportunity to stretch their advantage over United in the race for automatic promotion to a massive  points.Their own scheduled action at Dunfermline on Saturday afternoon had to be called off after heavy snow and rain left the East End Park playing surface saturated.United had already arrived at the ground and most of their travelling support were not that far away when the call-off was confirmed just  minutes from kick-off.That made it a frustrating afternoon, particularly as it was clear the pitch was in no fit state for a game to be played.But it still means the Tangerines can cut the deficit to their main rivals to eight pointsthey can beat them.With another clash between the pair to come in the Highlands early next month, a victory would leave boss Robbie Neilson still believing his side can finish in top spot in the second tier.To do that United will have to find the form that’s deserted them in recent outings. They’ve managed just one win in four games.And as well as a dip in performance over that period, United have struggled to find the back of the net from open play.In the last five games, only Cammy Smith’s close-range opener in the draw at Falkirk was not from a set-piece and the four other efforts to hit the mark have all been from the boot of Nicky Clark, either from the penalty spot or free-kicks.The effort to improve on that will not be helped by the absence of main striker Pavol Safranko tonight and again when Alloa visit on Saturday, because he is now away on international duty with Slovakia.The other experienced No  in the squad, Osman Sow, would not have been fit for the weekend after aggravating a troublesome calf problem early on in the last outing down at Partick Thistle.Sow was being checked in training yesterday but the chances are he will not make tonight and will even be a major doubt for this weekend.That being the case, Robbie has a big call to make when it comes to how he sets up his attack for the next couple of outings.He does at least have Peter Pawlett back available after the one-game suspension he picked up for his red card in the league win over Inverness. Theof the former Aberdeen man could see Clark pushed right up top and him used in a supporting role.Another option would be to use Matty Smith as the main striker but given the young attacker has not started since the Tannadice win over Dunfermline back on January , that would be a big ask.Whatever way he decides to go, tonight and in the coming games, the boss will be looking for both more chances to be created and a much better conversation rate.That will be a challenge against a County team that have hit league-winning form since mid-January.Their only defeat in  games in all competitions was when they went down to Inverness on penalties in a Scottish Cup replay."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

The cash injection could double the  aerospace jobs in Ayrshire to . The money has been announced as part of the Ayrshire Growth Deal, which was agreed last Friday. Plans for two new aircraft hangars have been revealed. There will be a purpose-built ,ft² aerospace and space innovation centre for research and business development in partnership with universities. A visitor centre promoting science around space and aviation is also included in the bid. And up to to ,ft² of industrial manufacturing space is to be developed. Publicly-owned Glasgow Prestwick Airport has made a loss in the past. A transport assessment is taking place to weigh up the impact of expansion on rail and road links. The airport vision was revealed on Friday when the Ayrshire Growth Deal heads of terms agreement was signed by politicians. Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: “From a UK perspective Prestwick is one of the most important sites for aerospace and a potential spaceport.” Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the plans would see the public and private sector join forces with academia to grow the aerospace and space sector. The deal sees £ million invested by the UK Government, £ million by the Scottish Government and £ million from South Ayrshire Council in the airport. South Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Campbell said the deal overall ensured Ayrshire “punches well above its weight in terms of what we contribute to the economy”. He described the signing of the heads of agreement as a “truly historic occasion” and the “pinnacle of more than three years of hard work.” Councillor Brian McGinley, local economy and culture chief, said: “To make the most of this investment we are determined that the benefits are shared by all, bringing quality training and jobs that will pay good wages.” Overall the £. million Ayrshire Growth Deal aims to generate  jobs. The investment will be delivered over  years. Elsewhere in the area there are plans for a low-carbon energy scheme at Hunterston, a local electricity supply project in Cumnock and a manufacturing corridor in Kilmarnock.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwick AirportSouth Ayrshire CouncilUniversities and CollegesCumnockAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire primary school blasted hm","story":"NewsAyrshire primary school blasted in HM Inspectors report cardAdditional support is needed to help schoolShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsShared campus of Patna and St. Xaviers primary schools.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA primary school has been slated in an HM Inspectors report card. Patna Primary School, which also incorporates an Early Childhood and Support Learning Centre, was rated “weak” across two quality indicators following a recent visit. A team of HM Inspectors visited the school, which shares a campus with St Xavier’s PS, in December, but their findings were only made public last week. The school was deemed to have fallen short under the ‘Learning, teaching and assessment’ quality indicators- with the report stating that, in the majority of lessons, children were “slow to engage in their work” and “required encouragement” to start tasks. Inspectors said that children’s “curiosity and engagement” was “not being developed well enough” and they mentioned an “important weakness” in children’s learning. In another body blow, the school was rated “weak” when it came to raising attainment in literacy and numeracy. The report states: “Overall attainment in literacy and numeracy is weak. As a result, HM Inspector, Carol Copstick, said that the school needed “additional support” in to make “necessary improvements.” HM Inspectors willto the school within a year to ensure that progress is being made. St. Xavier’s Primary School, which is based in the same campus, was deemed to be “very good” and “good” across two key indicators during a  inspection. SNP Doon Valley councillor John Bell, said he was initially shocked by the report and said the school had dedicated, conscientious staff and fantastic, hard-working children.” On a positive note the school was praised for its “caring ethos” and the “positive relationships” fostered by the nursery team. Linda McAulay-Grfiths, East Ayrshire Council’s head of education said: “It’s important to remember that a school inspection report is a snapshot in time and many of the recommendations contained in the Inspector’s report are being implemented, or are already in place.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilScottish National PartyEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"end era popular ayr music","story":"NewsEnd of era as popular Ayr music shop shuts downBig Sparra Vinyl in Ayr has announced its closure following a recent flood at the New Bridge Street store.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsIan Wallace of Big Sparra Vinyl \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the end of an era for a much-loved record store which has touched the hearts- and ears- of many across the country.

Heathfield operator Ediston has applied to alter planning conditions to allow them both to occupy the former Homebase unit. The application got the go-ahead at the South Ayrshire Council Regulatory Panel last week. Discount store Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty and gardening products. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. Ayr Central operators MG Real Estate lodged an objection to the plan. Representing them, Planner Kathryn Donnelly told the meeting: “We believe the proposals could be incorporated into the town centre.” She added: “There is an urgent need to protect Ayr town centre.” Ms Donnelly, of GL Hern, told councillors: “We need to entice national retailers.”    She said Ayr Central supports  local jobs. Ediston representative Alex Mitchell said Food Warehouse would take up , square feet. Mr Mitchell, of Zander Planning, said: “No units like that are available in the town centre.” Claiming it could bolster the town in general, he said: “Retail parks can draw people in from surrounding areas.” A document said the empty Homebase premises were too big for just one shop. Councillors approved requests to allow planning unit to be ided into two shops, and permit homeware goods and food to be sold from it. Councillor Peter Convery said: “There isn’t one of us here who doesn’t want the town centre to be vibrant again.” Expressing his support for the High Street and Heathfield,  chair Councillor Brian Connolly said: “We want them all to be successful.” But Councillor Andy Campbell said: “This has been an opportunity to attract outlets to the town centre.

And they called for better conditions for workers and customers. It is understood Ayr railway station will never operate from the abandoned building again. Now there are plans for Scotrail workers to move into other portable cabins at the bottom of the car park on Station Road. South Ayrshire Council was forced to take control of the privately owned Station Hotel last year when its dilapidated state made it a danger to the public. Station staff were moved to portable cabins beside the building. Mick Hogg, regional organiser for the RMT union in Scotland, said staff working conditions are unacceptable. He said: “We need a facility that is fit for purpose. “We would rather see the building demolished. We want to start from scratch to ensure our members are working in a safe environment.” He added: “Our members and the travelling public should not be subjected to any health and safety risk as a result of this shambles at Ayr Station. The shambles has been created by the refusal of Network Rail and other stakeholders to take ownership of a building that was falling to bits.” Union representatives want workers moved to the better portacable cabins on the other side of the railway tracks as soon as possible. Health and safety rep Willie Harper said: “It has been very challenging.” Gerry McCann, an RMT official from Ayr, said: “The staff are crammed into a portable cabins. There is no fresh running water.” He said facilities were not good enough for rail passengers. People waiting for trains to Glasgow or bus links to the ferries at Cairnryan have no shelter. He said: “People have to stand out in the rain. We want action.” An exclusion zone is in place around parts of the hotel to keep people away from the structure while work proceeds to make it safe. MSP Colin Smyth met the union and Scotrail to make the case for improvements last week. He said: “While staff had to be moved quickly out of offices which were part of the same building as the Station Hotel due to safety fears, the temporary arrangements put in place don’t deliver for staff o.” The council are in discussions with Transport Scotland, Network Rail and Scotrail about the future of the building. A Scotrail spokesman said: “We are committed to providing the best possible working environment for our people. We are working closely with our Network Rail Scotland colleagues and trade union representatives to deliver a long- term solution for the facilities atAyr Station.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilTransport ScotlandAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands biggest school takes shape","story":"NewsScotlands biggest school takes shape in Ayrshire£m super school will open in the summer of ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt was a real family affair for a Cumnock boy after he bumped into his dad during a VIP trip to what will be Scotland’s biggest school.

Cameron said: “The school will be open by the summer of , and it will see around  pupils attend. Not only will it be the biggest school in Scotland, but one of the biggest in the UK.” The scale of the project was brought home to the pupils when it was explained that it’ll take around  to  minutes to walk around the entire school once it’s complete. The pupils were also equally impressed when they heard that, once operational, around  dferent classes will be running at any one time, the football and rugby pitches will be made of G turf, while solar  will be erected on the PE block to harness energy from the sun.

The objectors also presented evidence to the committee showing how their own planning policies were being ignored by their officials.Peebles Community Council and many residents objected to the land at South Parks site being earmarked for development in the Local Development Plan back in .Mr Turnbull said: ldquoWhat makes objectors particularly annoyed is the notion that once building sites have been included in Local Development Plans, their inclusion cannot be questioned.\"Their views then were ignored just as their views have been totally ignored now. One of the questions that needs to be asked is, why Mr Turnbull said the conduct of the planning committee with the housing application was ldquoappalling and added that the system is loaded in favour of developers.He added: ldquoWell over  dferent objectors submitted some very detailed evidence to planners who ignored it.\"This has brought many objectors to question the validity of the planning process. It would appear that this process is designed to allow developers to build as and when they want and they can appealtheir application is refused.ldquoObjectors on the other hand have no right of appeal given that they have no right of appeal it is surely essential that they are given a fair hearing where evidence is properly considered.ldquoIn the South Parks case, Councillor Fullarton made comments regarding the Caledonian Road being wide and safe, based on his knowledge of over  years ago - no one challenged him.ldquoWhat has caused so much anger was that not a single councillor on the committee knew enough about Peebles to question Councillor Fullartonrsquos assertion. It may be that the planning committee has insufficient time to deal properly with these more complicated and contentious applicationsthat is the case then something has to change.ldquoThey simply failed to understand the issues before them nor the tremendous amount of anger within our community.\"The Scottish Government has launched an initiative called Democracy Matters, which aims to improve the level of involvement of local communities.Mr Turnbull continued: ldquoWhat is the pointplanning officers can write what they want, ignore government guidance and legislation, which is then allowed to stand by councillors who either do not have the knowledge to challenge them or the will to do so. For democracy to matter the peoplesrsquo voice needs to be heard.The community leader says the democratic deficit will be brought into sharp focus with the next Local Development plan, and heeded a warning to elected councillors to be prepared to answer why Peebles is mooted for major development when Scottish Borders Council is not prepared to develop infrastructure first.Scottish Borders Council strongly refutes the claims that councillors and officials ignored the views of the community.A spokesperson said: ldquoAll planning decisions require the delicate balancing of a range of policy objectives and other material factors, including the views expressed by the Community Council.\"The two recent planning applications in Peebles highlighted how dficult that can be and the complexity of the decision making process. Both proposals were subject to detailed analysis, which was reflected in the presentation of the cases by officers and the y debate members had on these applications.ldquoIt is clear that a considerable amount of time was spent considering the points and issues made both for and against the proposed developments. Indeed, both applications were revised to take into consideration the views expressed by local residents and the Community Council.ldquoUltimately, and after considering all of the evidence before them, the Committee came to the view that it could support one of the applications, which was the development at South Parks.

There will be easy climbing, and therersquos two possible loops one at Ladhope and one at Langlee, so there is good potential at both ends for family route.ldquoThe other type of route we call lsquofit familyrsquo. Higher grade cycling, running, and walking, on higher ground.ldquoTherersquos loads of potential, itrsquos a big area, the views are fantastic, and people will want to get up there. The only dficulty at the moment is getting up the steep slopes.ldquoSo the bulk of the multi use trail network will be building easy climb trails to get people to the top without too much stress.However, horse riders have voiced concerns over the plans which will could see more mountain bikes sharing the paths with horse riders.And local residents Diane Leaver and Susan Burrow, both of Langlee Mains, attended the meeting.Ms Leaver told councillors: ldquoWersquove already had a handful of incidents with bikes coming down the road to Langlee Mains fast and with dferent residents coming round a steep corner, and the bikes coming the other way.ldquoFortunately they have been far enough away to be able to stop so there hasnrsquot been an accident yet, but, you cannot see cars coming up until yoursquore almost at the junction.Ms Burrow added: ldquoThe main concern is the specic mountain bike tracks, because although where they join the core paths there will be bits for them to slow up, Irsquom not sure that will be enough.,params: .pushldquoMy question is, will I be able to rise safely  Sometimes when wersquore riding along they go lsquooff-pistersquo so to speak, and so therefore therersquos nothing to slow them up.Galashiels and District councillor Harry Scott also voice concerns at the plans, but his main concern is that there isnrsquot ample parking for visitors.He told the committee: ldquoI have mixed feelings about this, Irsquoll be honest with you. The Langlee Woods is very popular with walkers, and cyclists, and I know therersquos a good and a bad with everything and some of the cyclists come down the tracks without any idea of where theyrsquore going and who might be going to meet them.ldquoThe other thing that concerns is me is that in Langlee and Ladhope golf course, I donrsquot want to see any parking in these areas.ldquoIt has to be discouraged. The road up to Langlee Mains Farm is not suitable for the type of cycles yoursquore talking about, itrsquos a narrow, twisty road with zones of invisibility.ldquoIf there is to be parking, I suggest you look where.Councillors voted unanimously to submit the plans to the public for consultation, and for a report to be brought back to the committee in the future.Council officers also confirmed that the trail network will require planning permission, which will give residents a second opportunity to submit their thoughts on the development."},{"url":null,"title":"iceland-store-boss-admits-ignoring-21-parking-tickets","story":"A SUPERMARKET manager has been hit with a four figure bill after ignoring a y string of parking tickets.David Humphries car was frequently ticketed over several months after being parked in a pay and display area behind the Iceland store in High Street, Galashiels, where he works.But the -year-old never paid the tickets or answered letters from the Scottish Borders Council asking him to reveal the identication of the driver, so the fines could be sent to the culprit.Now he has been fined a whopping pound, for ignoring the council letters - pound for each offence - and there is still a pound bill outstanding for the  original parking offences between April and July last year.Humphries of Bourtree Place, Hawick, pleaded guilty at Selkirk JP Court to a total of  charges.Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser told the court that there was no CCTV in the car park showing who had come to collect the car on the days of the offences and Humphries had never informed the council of the identity of the driver despite the repeated requests.But he pointed out Humphries worked in the Iceland store which is right beside the High Street car park.Mr Fraser also said that failing to reveal the identity of the driver carried a maximum penalty of pound, for each offence.He explained that the council had to go through the laborious process of establishing who the regular keeper of the vehicle was and to find out who the driver was for the penalty to be paid.Mr Fraser said:\"In relation to all these charges he ignored the correct parking penalty which was not paid.\"There were other people who could have used this car parkspace but have not been able to do so.\"The accuseds vehicle repeatedly committed the offences of being parked overtime.\"Who did that we do not know as the accused did not bother to communicate with the council and say who the driver was which is a legal requirement.\"Not guilty pleas to nine other charges relating to the parking offences were accepted by the Crown.Defence lawyer Colin Severin said his client was negotiating with the council about the outstanding parking fines.He added: \"He got to the point where he was bogged down with the volume of letters coming through and did not know how to react.\"Andrew Bramhall JP told Humphries that ulging the identity of the identity of the driver when an offence is committed was an important part of the Road Traffic Act legislation.He said: \"The onus was on you and it has mounted up considerably.\"Mr Bramhall said he would have fined Humphries pound for each offence but restricted the fine to pound due to the guilty plea.As there were  offences, the fine totalled pound - and Humphries, who earns pound, a year from his salary as the Iceland store manager - was allowed to pay it off in instalments of pound a month.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said afterwards: \"This court case sends out a message that Scottish Borders Council will take action against drivers who fail to pay a parking charge issued in any of our Pay and Display car parks.\"To avoid matters going to court, drivers should pay a parking charge notice within the -day deadline.\"Alternatively, to avoid a penalty altogether, simply pay the appropriate parking fee for your vehicles stay.\"It is also a criminal offence for the keeper of a vehicle to fail to give the identication of the driver to the Councila parking charge notice has been issued.\"If anyone is concerned about an outstanding parking charge notice they have received please contact the Councils parking team on    or visit our website.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lorry-driver-accused-of-being-four-times-legal-limit-on-a7-and-a68","story":"A LORRY driver has been accused of being more than four times the alcohol limit while driving through the Borders.Sixty two year old Donald Russell denies driving with a breath alcohol count of  microgrammes -

That needs to change.In my profession, on the set of a Hollywood movie,actors don’t listen to each other, the scene doesn’t work.The same applies in real le – it’s about taking the time to understand dferent points of view and showing respect.Good listening is vital at both home and at work.

Craig Galbraith worked well playing with, eventual man of the match, Calum Johnson for the first time.In the th minute there was a skirmish in the box after a corner, Johnson cleared the ball but it ricocheted off the incoming player into the net.The Glasgow students had more possession with the wind advantage. With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"kspbs novice b band impresses","story":"Last Sunday#s Livingston performance was the first time a pipe band of any grade from Campbeltown has taken part in these championships and it was dficult for them to know what to expect.The band was in a category of  others and they needed a good performance, to get a place, as there were a number of top bands playing.Kintyre Schools Band, the top band from a non-fee-paying school, gave a great performance playing Sweet Maid of Glendarual, Greenwood side, Fairwell to Aberdeen and Campbell’s Fairwell to Redcastle.After everyone had played it was over to the judges and the Novice B band was placed as follows: piping adjudicatorone: J Wilson # , PA two:  J Connor-, drumming adjudicator: A Dudgeon-, ensemble adjudicator-D Brown-.When added together this gave the Campbeltown band a total of  points and gave them a very credible fourth place and only two points off the second placed band.After the results were confirmed Pipe Major Fiona Mitchell said how proud she was of her young band and thought th place was a very good start to the season.Both KPBA bands, KSPB and Beinn an Tuirc Kintyre are now practicing hard for the first major pipe band competition of the season when the bands perform at the British Championships in Paisley on Saturday May .KSPB Novice B band perform at Livingston.

proposing £, more for winter gritting, outwith the A which is covered by the contract with BEAR.This was against cuts in the road safety unit, an award-winning safety programme for young children, a cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There were amendments lodged by Councillor Donald Kelly and myself, the SNP group and councillors George Freeman and Jean Moffat.While gritting our roads is important Councillor Kelly and I, along with other council opposition groups, thought the other considerations were important to our communities which strangely enough is also supported by our corporate plan.Alas the gritting won the day.Full motions and votes can be found on the council website.However it was more disappointing that Councillor Kelly and I included in our motion a scheme to change funding due for Helensburgh and Dunoon.Just more than £ million would be moved to the regeneration project of Tarbert Lochgilphead Ardrishaig.This was defeated by the rest of the council which was particularly galling.Money for

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

the subject in October, MSPs from across the parties at Holyrood gave their support for providing protection of title.Mr Halcro Johnston said: ldquoFor too long, the Scottish Government has dithered around the regulation of electricians.ldquoIt has been discussed and discussed again, without any real commitments ever seeing the light of day.ldquoWhen I speak to people about this campaign, the first reaction is usually surprise that anyone can call themselves an electrician without any qualication.ldquoWhen so many other trades and professions are regulated, it seems the position of electricians is more of an anomaly than anything .ldquoMost people donrsquot consult electricians on a regular basis and arenrsquot always confident about the qualications of people they employ. This should provide some additional protection to consumers.ldquoElectrical safety is vitally important. Every year, there are fatalities caused by electric shocks and fires caused by electrical mals. It is important that people carrying out electrical work are qualied and able to do so.ldquoI was pleased to get so much support from across the political parties when this was debated back in October and I would hope that support would carry across to introducing a Bill on the subject.Skills Minister Jamie Hepburn said: ldquoThe serious concerns raised about electricians are being considered fully and we are committed to continuing to work in partnership with all stakeholders.ldquoDuring a debate in Parliament in October last year, I offered to meet with any MSPs to discuss these issues further. Whilst others have made contact, Mr Halcro Johnston has not taken up this offer.ldquoFollowing calls for further regulation, we formed the Electricians Working Group to bring the industry together and attempt to build consensus for a way forward.ldquoAn independent analysis of research, leading to a risk assessment and business case on the way forward, is due to be presented to the Scottish Government later in March."},{"url":null,"title":"we-are-f-says-official-report-on-impact-of-brexit-on-rural-scotland","story":"A document published by Scottish Rural Actionfeatured a side banner on page four with the statement.It was one of a number of banners attributed to participants in a workshop which asked them to imagine what newspaper headlines they might expect to see after Brexit.Amanda Burgauer, SRA chairwoman, said that the exercise had been used as an ldquoicebreaker and that several of the participants had used ldquoearthy language in describing their feelings towards Brexit.The comments are only explained on the following page, saying they had been put forward by those taking part in the workshop event.Ms Burgauer said that she would flag up the ldquodesign and layout issue with the SRA design team.The Scottish Government has said that although the SRA report was funded through its Brexit Stakeholder Fund, it had no editorial role.The report will be launched at an SRA event with cabinet secretaries Mike Russell and Richard Lochhead in Elgin on Monday.Its findings also detailed the potential impact of Brexit on rural Scotland, suggesting that it could lead to ldquost century clearances, with a loss of freedom of movement resulting in signicant depopulation.Further concerns raised in the report, taken from conversations with rural communities, also included the risk of EU funding being lost post-Brexit and potential damage to social cohesion.Speaking about the report overall, Ms Burgauer said: ldquoThis report is about giving voice to a rural point of view that is rooted in Scotlandrsquos people and places, rather than its rural industries.She added: ldquoThere is widespread anger and frustration across rural Scotland, but that anger isnrsquot solely about Brexit.ldquoIt was clear from workshop discussions that Brexit is compounding long standing concerns about rural equity and fragility.ldquoBrexit was described as the lsquostraw that breaks rural Scotlandrsquos backrsquo, with people pointing to structural fragilities across rural communities.ldquoParticipants generally believed that an historic over-reliance on EU funding to lsquoprop uprsquo rural areas makes rural Scotland particularly exposed to future loss of EU support.Speaking ahead of the reportrsquos launch, Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell said: ldquoThe Scottish Government is committed to ensuring the voices of rural communities are heard and I commend Scottish Rural Action for the work it has done to achieve this.ldquoThe findings in this report are stark.

The debts have been repeatedly triggered in the plumbing scheme due to the high number of employers that have used it over the years.ldquoUnfortunately employer debt legislation is a case of well-intentioned legislation having unintended consequences because the sums of money employers are being asked to pay are quite large, she said.ldquoWe have a staggering amount of orphan liabilities, which relate to employers who are no longer contributing - about , employers in total have used the scheme.ldquoA debt is triggered when an employer winds up, goes insolvent or when their last employee leaves the scheme, but some that have triggered a debt may still be contributing to the scheme.ldquoA number of employers are very small and might only have one or two plumbers. They might have someone leave and then have a gap before someone  joins them - that gap would trigger a debt.Up until now the scheme has not collected any of these debts, with Ms Yates noting that its trustees, who had lobbied the Government for a change in the law, previously feltthe cost of doing so would be disproportionately high. They are looking to collect the debts now because the scheme, which has , members in Scotland and , in the rest of the UK, is expected to close to future accruals later this year.Fiona Hodgson, chief executive of the Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employersrsquo Federation , said the move has ldquonaturally raised serious concerns for our members.:Making a clear position on pensions.ldquoThe impact of Section  has the potential to be devastating for local businesses and the wider community, with the possibility of huge Section  debts looming over businesses who were simply trying to be good employers by providing a pension for their employees, she said.Affected businesses will start receiving demand letters between now and the end of June, although Ms Yates said that the scheme does not intend to collect every debt it issues a notice for. Where the sums are small, for example, it will be unlikely to seek payment.Meanwhile, the  firms that currently contribute to the pound billion scheme,  of which are based in Scotland, will have to find alternative pension arrangements for their employeesthe scheme closes to future accruals this summer as planned.Peter Mutch of law firm Aberdein Considine said that in addition to sourcing a defined contribution pension for their staff, employers will have to arrange benefits such as death in service cover that have until now been provided by the defined benefit scheme.Changes are being made to the pension because, while it has the funds to meet all its existing liabilities, contributions from non-retired members would have to rise signicantly in order for it to honour any further accruals.Trade union Unite is refusing to back the plan until it gets assurances about the level of contributions employers will pay into an alternative scheme.Its representative Bernard McAulay said: ldquoThis has been the jewel in the crown of pension schemes in the construction industry.ldquoOur members have contributed to it, they are very proud of it and itrsquos something they donrsquot want to lose.ldquoWersquore doing our best to make sure that what comes into being goes a long way to matching the industry standards."},{"url":null,"title":"why-was-the-irish-flag-removed-from-dens-park-during-dundee-v-celtic","story":"Video circulating around Twitter showedthe Irish flag being removed during Celtics - win over Dundee on Sunday.And the fan who had his flag removed said afterwards he was told to leave the ground after he went to retrieve it from stewards.While supporters groups voiced their disgust at the actions, Dundee said the reason was not sinister - stating simply that the flag breached rules as it was covering advertising.Police Scotland saidwere were a total of two arrests and  ejections from the ground, with seven refusals of entry, during the match but said that incident over the flag was a matter for the stewards.:Celtic fans arrested after aggressive incident in DundeeFans Against Criminalisation, the group set up to move for the scrapping of the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Scotland Act  criticised the overpolicing of Sundays match A FAC representative tweeted: \"I am explicitly saying that it is entirely legitimate for someone who in any way, shape or form identies with Ireland to take such a flag to a Celtic game.

Some were not told full details until this year, when the case reached the professional watchdog.The council claims it did all it could to keep families informed, but the problems were largely down to one rogue teacher, and the schoolrsquos former deputy head who failed to pass concerns on was disciplined and has subsequently left the profession. Further delays were caused by the school holidays and allowing the police investigation to run its course.But between March and June  when police were finally called in, pupil Arsquos unsuspecting parents had agreed to him having daily one-to-one lessons with Mrs Mackie. The boyrsquos mother says she and her husband went in three times to speak to the school over this period to discuss their sonrsquos sudden aversion to school and changes in his behaviour - and were still not told colleagues had raised concerns overMrs Mackies treatment of their son.Meanwhile the mother of pupil lsquoPrsquo in the GTC case ndash whose son Mackie left to bang his head off the floor until he was hysterical and covered in bruises says the publication of the hearing findings last week was the first time she knew in full what had happened to her son.She says it took this family a year and a half to get to the stage where P was able to go to school willingly again.Both families say the emphasis appears to have been on the teacherrsquos wellbeing throughout, rather than that of pupils ndash in breach of ldquoGetting it Right for Every Childpolicies, which state that childrenrsquos needs should always be paramount.Meanwhile the Herald has learned that another child at Chatelherault had fruit forced into his mouth by a dferent teacher. Investigations were launched into this case, but were dropped after the woman left teaching.An education insider at South Lanarkshire Council, has claimed Mrs Mackiersquos mistreatment of pupils would have been reported earlier, but other staff were ldquoafraid of her reactionthey intervened.The claims come as autism and learning disability charities warn that behavioural problems in pupils who are non verbal or on the autistic spectrum are often leading to children being restrained, isolated or mistreated. In fact, parents and charities say such misbehaviour is often an attempt to communicate rather than to be lsquobadrsquo.South Lanarkshire council officials believe the mistreatment was a one off and is not evidence of a pattern within the councilrsquos schools.The council says it runs four tailored programmes for autistic children of dferent ages, delivered in partnership with the National Autistic Society.It has a dedicated resource in Hamilton for people with autism and their families, and has given , primary and secondary teachers training in meeting the needs of autistic pupils.A council spokesman said: ldquoPupil safety and wellbeing is of paramount importance in South Lanarkshirersquos schools.ldquoWe always act swtly and appropriately when any allegations of inappropriate activity are brought to our attention, and that is exactly what happened in this case.Once the concerns were brought to the attention f the headteacher in June , a formal investigation was launched immediately and disciplinary action was instigated, while the matter was reported to both the police and the General Teaching Council.ldquoAt every stage we were as open with parents as possible, given the restrictions imposed on us by the police investigation and subsequent court case, ldquo the spokesman said.ldquoThe school continued to meet parents regularly to work together to help their children, and as part of this we have apologised for any incidents where the high standards that we set, and which parents rightly expect, were not delivered by iniduals.He added: ldquoWe are pleased that all of the pupils referred to in the GTCS hearing, and those whose cases have been raised by the Herald, remain in our schools, with parents and staff working together to give them the best possible educational experience."},{"url":null,"title":"bumper-shetland-oil-fields-could-be-in-production-for-decades","story":"The company has launched a drilling programme that will target two big prospects that could help unlock the potential of a frontier area that sector watchers reckon could help ensure a bright future for the industry.Success for Siccar Point in the programme would encourage other firms to step up the hunt for finds off Shetland.

This underlines the importance of the value we place on meeting our environmental obligations as we plan and construct new infrastructure. This book, which provides valuable details on the archaeological finds, will be essential reading for everyone who has an interest in the North-East’s history.”Bruce Mann, Archaeologist for the council, explained: “This book provides more details on our fascinating discoveries from the archaeological works carried out on the AWPR site. For instance, a very unexpected discovery was the presence of Roman activity at Milltimber, likely dating from around   AD. Ninety bread ovens were uncovered, which were probably constructed by the Roman army at a time of invasion led by the Roman General Agricola. However, no evidence of an associated camp was found, which is unusual for these types of features. We can only speculate as to why the ovens were in this location.“Going back to the very earliest finds, there was also evidence of stone tool production dating between about , and , BC at Milltimber, a near unprecedented body of evidence which pushes back our understanding of human activity in north east Scotland by several thousand years.”Bruce continued:“Bronze Age activity was identied from Nether Beanshill in the form of a roundhouse and contemporary cremation complex dating from around , to , BC. The burial comprised of an urn in which the cremated remains of an inidual in their s had been placed. This urn was placed in a pit which was then marked by a horseshoe-shaped arrangement of timber posts.

If cattle react aggressively, release your dog and take the shortest, safest route out of the field.The Scottish Outdoor Access Code website provides more information, including online video tutorials covering everything from teaching a dog to be relaxed around livestock through to dog walker etiquette and legal responsibilities.Dog behaviourist and trainer Natalie Light said: “These videos are packed full of great tips that will give dog owners the information and skills to have fun and safe walks in Scotland’s outdoors as well as understand their rights and responsibilities under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.“I hope they encourage everyone to get involved and have the confidence to enjoy getting out and about with their pets this spring.”Farmers and other land managers are also encouraged to support responsible access with dogs by following the guidance in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, for example by avoiding putting sheep close to lambing in fields with well-used routes, or indicating reasonable alternatives. If necessary, local access officers can also provide advice.More information is available on the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At this busy time of year, the union is urging applicants to start filling out their SAF and is reminding them that, as things stand, it#s business as usual for all CAP schemes.The union has also said the online application process has seen signicant improvements in recent years and the clear majority of applications are now made online. By submitting your application online, the system will flag any errors before submitting your application.Paper forms will not be automatically posted out and must instead be requested from Local Area Offices. Iniduals can also go to their Local Area Office where staff will be on hand to assist those completing their form online.NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick said: “Brexit chaos and confusion are dominating the headlines and generating uncertainty. The crucial thing for all farmers and crofters to bear in mind is that, as things stand, it is business as usual for all CAP schemes and that includes completing this year’s SAF.“The SAF window, which will run from  March to  May, will be punctured by Brexit headlines but we don’t want anyone to inadvertently be distracted from this important process. SAF forms are the most important forms that Scottish farmers fill out every year and I would encourage all members to begin working on their forms as soon as possible to ensure they meet the  May deadline.“For the second year, paper forms will not be automatically sent out by post, with the Scottish Government continuing to encourage claimants to complete their SAF online. Whether you are happy to switch to online or are sticking to paper, the important thing is to take plenty of time and not leave it to the last-minute. Remember, it is the most important day’s work in any farmer’s year.”• Online applications can be submitted via the Scottish Government#s rural payments and services website, at www.ruralpayments.org.A paper copy of the Single Application Form can be picked up at the Scottish Government#s office, in the Government Buildings, on Junction Road, Kirkwall. Paper forms can be handed there, or sent to: Scottish Government, Agriculture and Rural Economy, Government Buildings, Tankerness Lane, Kirkwall, KW AQ.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The leboat’s entire crew of eight lost their lives as they selflessly headed towards the cargo ship.The crew lost were: coxswain Daniel Kirkpatrick, nd coxswain James Johnston, bowman Ray Kirkpatrick, mechanic Robert Johnston, assistant mechanic James Swanson, and crew Jack Kirkpatrick, Robert Johnston and Eric McFadyen.Longhope RNLI and Longhope Leboat Museum Trust have in recent months, been in the process of preparing for the commemorative events marking  years since the loss of the T.G.B. and her gallant crew.Those events will take place both on land and at sea today, including at the Longhope Leboat Museum, the former leboat shed in Brims, where Longhope leboats were based for many years, before being based at Longhope Pier.Commemorations will also take place in front of the Longhope Leboat Memorial at Osmundwall, and at the YM Hall, Longhope.It is planned that a flotilla of boats, including RNLI leboats from Thurso, Stromness, Wick, and the current Longhope Leboat, plus the Coastguard tug Ievoli Black, an Orkney Harbours tug, pilot boat, and vintage leboat from Ireland, will congregate in Aith Hope, to lower their flags as a mark of respect. The Coastguard will also be represented by one of their rescue helicopters.Flags at leboat stations around Scotland, the RNLI’s Divisional Base in Perth, and at the RNLI’s HQ in Poole will be lowered to half mast.Coverage will appear online on The Orcadian Facebook page today, and in a special supplement in The Orcadian, out on Thursday.Local company Cloudnet IT Solutions also plan to livestream aspects of the events live at: https:livestream accounts  TGBLonghope vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The true figure could be even higher as it doesn’t include those who have a parent born on the island of Ireland and can take a more direct route.Those applying are seeking a Brexit safety net, to retain the rights and freedoms the EU awards its citizens.

Most who hold this ancient office know the importance of not being seen to interfere directly in the politics of the issues of the day and so usually don’t trouble the headline writers.John Bercow, however, has demonstrated on a number of occasions that he is not afraid to do just that. And yesterday he made a ruling that has thrown Theresa May’s attempts to pass her Brexit deal with the EU into disarray.Amid signs that hardline Brexiteers were beginning to crumble, belatedly accepting the reality that their fancul demands were never going to be met and that May’s deal was the only realistic one on offer, the UK Government had started to believe they might have a chance of finally getting it through the Commons. But then, with  days to go before the UK leaves the EU without any kind of deal, Bercow announced that the Government could not legitimately “resubmit to the House the same proposition or substantially the same proposition as that of last week which was rejected by  votes”.: Brexit: John Bercow rules out third vote on deal without changesParliamentary convention dating back to , he argued, prevented this on the grounds that allowing repeated votes on the same issue would enable governments to misuse MPs’ time and ignore their decisions.However, critics of his decision pointed to a considerably more recent opinion – from Bercow himself – that suggested he might be playing politics. “If we were guided only by precedent, manestly nothing in our procedures would ever change,” he told MPs in January.And it should go without saying that these are “unprecedented” times where the most important thing is the national interest – not parliamentary traditions. Only in similarly high-stakes situations would any future Government be able to cite this as a precedent.Bercow, who has revealed he had voted Remain, may believe he is defending the Commons’ rules others will suspect he hopes defeating May’s deal will lead to a second referendum. If the latter is true, he is playing a dangerous game of roulette that could well result in the worst of all outcomes – a no-deal Brexit.

Instead, in front of Scotland’s parliament, she branded him a disgrace.“It’s no wonder officers are losing faith in this SNP government with that kind of attitude. These brave and hardworking police officers should not be discriminated against because they don’t threaten to go on strike.“The First Minister needs to apologise for being so dismissive of his concerns.”In the letter, the anonymous officer said: “Why has such a massive importance been placed on the pay rise for school teachers when other public service staff are not being awarded nearly as much as a pay rise “Does the Scottish Government place the value of police officers as only half that of school teachers  Is it that the Government know that because police officers cannot strike or take any real industrial action that they are an easy target ”A spokesman for the First Minister later said that she would not apologise as her \"disgraceful\" comment was not directed at the police officer but at Graham Simpson.During First Ministers Questions, Mr Simpson was booed by SNP backbenchers as he read out the letter, and asked what Nicola Sturgeon would say to the officer and “thousands of others” like him.Ms Sturgeon went on to say: “In terms of our NHS workers many get higher pay in Scotland than they do in England because of the value we attach to the work that they do.“In terms of teachers they have now been offered an exceptionally good pay deal and I think that is recognition of the good work that they do and I hope that is now accepted.“But I value all public sector workers and I thinkyou look at any group of public sector workers you will find that the value attached to them by the Scottish Government is much much greater than the value attached to their counterparts in England by the Tory government at Westminster.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scots living in remote communities claim they are f because of brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scots living in remote areas have issued a stark warning that #we are f*****# as result of Brexit, an official report as revealed.The blunt language appears in a document published by Scottish Rural Action . It featured on a side banner on page four of the document.It was one of a number of banners attributed to participants in a workshop which asked them to imagine what newspaper headlines they might expect to see after Brexit.Amanda Burgauer, SRA chairwoman, said that the exercise had been used as an “icebreaker” and that several of the participants had used “earthy language” in describing their feelings towards Brexit.The comments are explained on the following page, saying they had been put forward by those taking part in the workshop event. Ms Burgauer said that she would flag up the “design and layout” issue with the SRA design team.The Scottish Government has said that although the SRA report was funded through its Brexit Stakeholder Fund, it had no editorial role.The report will be launched at an SRA event with cabinet secretaries Mike Russell and Richard Lochhead in Elgin on Monday.Its findings also detailed the potential impact of Brexit on rural Scotland, suggesting that it could lead to “st century clearances”, with a loss of freedom of movement resulting in signicant depopulation.Further concerns raised in the report, taken from conversations with rural communities, also included the risk of EU funding being lost post-Brexit and potential damage to social cohesion.Speaking about the report overall, Ms Burgauer said: “This report is about giving voice to a rural point of view that is rooted in Scotland’s people and places, rather than its rural industries.”She added: “There is widespread anger and frustration across rural Scotland, but that anger isn’t solely about Brexit.“It was clear from workshop discussions that Brexit is compounding long-standing concerns about rural equity and fragility.“Brexit was described as the ‘straw that breaks rural Scotland’s back’, with people pointing to structural fragilities across rural communities.“Participants generally believed that an historic over-reliance on EU funding to ‘prop up’ rural areas makes rural Scotland particularly exposed to future loss of EU support.”Brexit Secretary Mike Russell said: “The findings in this report are stark. Taking Scotland out of the EU against our will removes us from a market which is eight times bigger than the UK alone.“Rural communities are deeply worried about the impact of Brexit on their lives. From funding and trade to community le and the workforce, many believe the effects will be nothing short of catastrophic.”A UK government spokesman said: “Thriving rural areas with strong, sustainable economies and vibrant communities will continue to be a priority for the UK ­government when we leave the EU.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it.

However, in what is believed to be the first case of its kind, Sean was subsequently arrested and convicted under the Terrorism Act  for carrying the flag in circumstances that state authorities deemed to arouse suspicion that he is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation.This week, Sean revealed that his suspended sentence had been quashed with a £ fine issued in its stead following a court appeal against the earlier ruling.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sean said: “From the start of this I was of the opinion that no matter what the outcome of the case was that I was going to be fighting it. If I was convicted, and eventually was convicted, then the benchmark was set and would have big repercussions for republicans right across the board. The point we made was that this was a commemorative event. It was advertised as a commemorative event so we were trying to unravel the agenda of the PPS and the cops.“We’ve been of the opinion that, this is all because we didn’t buy into the Fresh Start Agreement,” he added.“The IRSP has been getting hounded since then. This flag issue was just another signicant push in relation to criminalising the IRSP. On a personal level, I couldn’t accept carrying a flag to commemorate your dead being a criminal offence – it’s unheard of.”Sean’s solicitor, Michael Brentnall, said that while the case has “set the benchmark” in terms of sentencing, the legislation surrounding the conviction stands to be challenged.“I think it’s signicant, particularly the judges remarks at the end, who stated that no person in Ireland should go to jail for carrying a flag in Ireland. That’s signicant in itself and it has set the benchmark for how these matters be dealt with. We’re now seeking senior council’s opinion on whether there is a point of law that can be taken to the court of appeal on the basis of the conviction alone rather than just the sentence.” He continued: “Each case is facts specic, but in Sean’s case it was said during proceedings that every case of somebody carrying a similar flag to a commemoration could be criminalised. Sean was the only person this had been enforced against – there’s an issue with that in itself, but then Sean’s barrister made the point that this was a clear breach of freedom of expression and the sanction was entirely excessive in relation to the context of what had happened.”He added: “Another point that we still have to explore is that the legislation is very vague. The legislation says that you can be a supporter or a member of a proscribed organisation. If this is a means of circumventing membership charges and having somebody landed with a charge then that’s a dferent fight.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37925662.ece/b9249/AUTOCROP/w620h342/BT_06385.jpg","title":"cookstown hotel crush horror people were scratching biting and grabbing anything they could to pull themselves up to breath says witness","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We’ve already passed the legislation to provide for a no-deal Brexit, we have the Common Travel Area and this package of measures to support incomes and jobs.“It’s not going to be a case of everything being all right, Brexit is bad news.”⁦Welcomed @eucopresident⁩ Donald Tusk back to ⁦@merrionstreet⁩ today to discuss #Brexit and #FutureofEurope before this week’s ⁦important @EUCouncil⁩ meeting pic IvDfuAcyB— Leo VaradkarMarch , Mr Varadkar also said he hoped his discussions with Mr Tusk could help avoid a “rolling extension”.He added: “I will have a chance to speak to him in more detail at that point and I would hope that things over the next couple of days may become a bit clearer in terms of what Westminster wants and what the British Government wants.“I’ve always said that what I would like to avoid is a rolling extension, where there is an extension every few months, that would just add to uncertainty and wouldn’t solve the problem.“There seems to be two emerging possibilities – one would be the ratication of the Withdrawal Agreement by Westminster followed by a short extension into the summer which would allow them time to pass the necessary legislation or potentially a much longer extension of up to two years and the purpose of that would be to allow other options to be considered, for example participation in Customs Union.”Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow provoked uproar at Westminster on Monday when he ruled that the Government could not bring the Prime Minister’s deal back for a third “meaningful vote” unless there were substantial changes.The Speaker’s ruling was welcomed by some Tory Brexiteers opposed to Theresa May’s deal, who argued that it increased the chances of a no-deal break.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has indicated ministers will continue to press on with Mrs May’s Brexit deal despite Mr Bercow’s ruling."},{"url":null,"title":"mays absolute determination to press on with brexit vote","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We didn’t want to give in,” said general manager Sandi Harding, who has worked at the franchise for  years and receives a lot of the credit for keeping it alive well past its expiration date.“We did everything we could to cut costs and keep ourselves relevant.”The store was once one of five Blockbusters owned by the same couple, Ken and Debbie Tisher, in three central Oregon towns.But by last year, the Bend franchise was the last local Blockbuster standing.A Blockbuster Video in Bend, Oregon is the last one on the planet after the only other Blockbuster in Australia announced it’s closing on March .The store is now booming with business from long-time locals as well as tourists. A tight budget meant no money to update the surviving store.That’s paying off now with a nostalgia factor that stops first-time visitors of a certain age in their tracks: the popcorn ceilings, low fluorescent lighting, wire metal video racks and the ubiquitous yellow-and-blue ticket stub logo that was a cultural touchstone for a generation.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sandi Harding has worked at the franchise for  years “Most people, I think, when they think about renting videos,they’re the right age, they don’t remember the movie that they went to pick, but they remember who they went with and that freedom of walking the aisles,” said Zeke Kamm, a local resident who is making a documentary about the store called The Last Blockbuster with a friend.“In a lot of towns, the Blockbuster was the only place that was open past nine o’clock, and a lot of them stayed open until midnight, so kids who weren’t hoodlums would come here and look at movies and fall in love with movies.”The Bend store had eight years under its belt as a local video store before it converted to a Blockbuster in , a time when this high desert city was still a sleepy community with a small-town feel to match.Customers kept coming back, drawn by special touches like staff recommendations, a “wish list” for videos to add to the rental selection and even home delivery for a few special customers who couldn’t drive in.Dozens of local teens have worked there over the years.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The store makes a good income from merchandise Then, in , Blockbuster declared bankruptcy, and by , all corporate-owned stores had shuttered.That left locally owned franchises to fend for themselves, and one by one, they closed.When stores in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska, shut down last summer, barely outlasting a Redmond, Oregon, store, Bend’s Blockbuster was the only US location left.Tourists started stopping by to snap selfies, and business picked up.Harding ordered up blue-and-yellow sweat shirts, T-shirts, cups, magnets, bumper stickers, hats and stocking caps from local vendors emblazoned with the words The Last Blockbuster In America, and they flew off the shelves.Then, this month, she got a phone call: The world’s only other Blockbuster, in Perth, Australia, would soon close its doors.A new T-shirt order went out, this time with the slogan The Last Blockbuster On The Planet, and the store is already getting a new wave of selfie-snapping visitors from as far away as Europe and Asia.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The store has become something of a tourist attraction On a recent weekday, Michael Trovato of Melbourne, Australia, stopped by while visiting his twin sister in Bend.After posing for a photo, Trovato said he misses a time when choosing a movie meant browsing hundreds of titles and asking a video clerk for insight instead of letting a movie-streaming service recommend one for him based on a computer algorithm.“I miss quite a bit being able to walk into a Blockbuster or CD store and have that social experience and see people looking at stuff and talking to people,” Trovato said. “It’s something you don’t get from the slick presentation of a music service or, you know, from the internet.”The Bend store doesn’t seem to be in danger of closing anytime soon.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Some parents find things in the store they can’t find online Its newfound fame has been a shot in the arm, and customers stream in to buy  US dollar sweat shirts,  dollar T-shirts and even  dollar yellow-and-blue beanies hand-knit by Harding herself.The store pays Dish Network for the right to use the Blockbuster logo and has several years left on its lease.People regularly send the store boxes of old VHS tapes and DVDs. They also donate Blockbuster memorabilia: a corporate jean jacket, key chains and old membership cards.Employees always send a thank-you note, store manager Dan Montgomery said.Recently, Harding has noticed another type of customer that is giving her hope: a new generation of kids dragged in by their nostalgic parents who later leave happy, holding stacks of rented movies and piles of candy.Jerry Gilless and his we, Elizabeth, brought their two children, John, three, and Ellen, five, and watched with a smile as the siblings bounced from row to row, grabbing Peter Pan and The Lion King and surveying dinosaur cartoons.“How could we not stop  It’s the last one,” said Gilless, of their detour to the store while on vacation from Memphis, Tennessee.“They need to see that not everything’s on the iPad.”"},{"url":null,"title":"man spends more than 600 on shop in preparation for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Having such high-tech equipment available locally would mean many people from the area would not have to travel long distances to have their tests carried out where, Mr McGrath continued.ldquoSuch a scan can be a worrying time and the fact that people have to travel to other places for the scan adds to the anxiety.Cllr Trainor said a mobile scanner currently in place at the Downe to ease pressure at the Ulster Hospital will only be there for a few more weeks.ldquoDoes this fact not make the business case for the local health trust, too many people using the current scanner at the Ulster so one is required at the Downe  he asked.ldquoI hope local health officials will hurry up with their administrative work required to progress the business case to provide an MRI scanner in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"City deals could bring finanacial boost for Newcastle  ","story":"PLANS to deliver a signicant multi-million pound tourism bonanza in Newcastle have taken an important step forward this week.Highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort are among the key projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector which have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.On Monday, members of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee agreed to sign a heads of agreement deal which paves the way for work to start on outline business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal which includes the Mournes Gateway project.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case and financial plans could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.And while the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The Newcastle tourism project was a key part of the city deal which has secured a near poundbn investment package from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.And while talks continue to secure cash under the city deal initiative, local council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for its other aspects and move the ious projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The tourism schemersquos other proposals include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision. There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes.A so-called lsquogreen travel networkrsquo which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency.Before anything happens, numerous planning and environmental approvals will be required, alongside the compilation of feasibility studies and business cases.The overarching vision of the gateway project is to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions which develop sustainable enhancement of access from Newcastle to the Mournes and its foothills and forests, while also broadening recreational provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Coney Island singer Jayne looking for support to produce new album  ","story":"FROM Coney Island, to Nashville and on to Vancouver, musician Jayne Trimble has travelled many miles to get to where she is today.The folk musician is heading to Los Angeles next month to record her third album mdash that isshe can raise at least , Canadian dollars mdash thatrsquos pound, mdash to cover initial production costs.The former Down High student is asking local people, and women in particular, to support her Kickstarter campaign to record the album Your Mother Was A Peacock.While Jaynersquos vocals are hauntingly soft, she describes her latest music as ldquovisceral and epic.She is recording the new album, which will be produced by Damien Jurado, under the name Oxlip mdash which is an Irish wildflower.ldquoItrsquos my most ambitious and exciting album to date, explained the  year-old. ldquoItrsquos a collection of songs based on the lives of women throughout history who have either been scapegoated, or were just plain tragic.

There is also concern about the surface of the existing car park which is particularly uneven and the absence of adequate parking for visitors with young families.The access from the car park to the beach for families pushing prams is described as ldquounsuitable with the financial spend approved at Mondayrsquos meeting designed to improve the overall visitor experience, create a better first impression, improve the car park surface and the number of available spaces.New directional signs are also proposed, with council officials warning failure to address the issues could result in the loss of blue flag status, result in a negative visitor experience, reduced visitor numbers and income.To progress the improvement work, council officials have agreed to appoint a contractor to design a scheme.The planned investment has been welcomed by Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran.He said he was pleased local authority officials have recognise the need to improve Tyrella to ensure it continues to attract a high number of visitors, particularly from April and September.ldquoTyrella is an extremely popular beach, he said. ldquoIt is highly regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos top beaches and it is vital it retains its blue flag status. We rely heavily upon tourism in our area and we need to ensure our beaches are up to standard.Cllr Curran says he has no doubt that investing in Tyrella is not only ldquogood news for the district and visitors to the area, but will produce an economic idend through increased use.He continued: ldquoWe are fortunate to have stunning beaches like Tyrella, Kilclief and Ballyhornan on our doorstep. Those who work to keep our bathing waters clean and, more importantly, up to an internationally recognised standard so they are safe to use, do a terric job.Cllr Curran said picturesque beaches helped make up the ldquounique fabric of Lecale and the surrounding area and were a vital tourism resource.He added: ldquoThe planned investment at Tyrella is a good news story and I am pleased that the local authority is not content to sit back on its laurels but recognises the importance of continuing investment in a wealth of tourism assets right across the entire district.ldquoDown District is lucky to be blessed with such priceless resources which can make a valuable contribution to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike. It is essential that we continue to strive for the very highest of standards across all our facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Derry Girls fun in Ballyhornan  ","story":"THE hit comedy series Derry Girls is putting Ballyhornan on the map.The Wee Shop in the small coastal village will be featured in one of the upcoming storylines of the much-anticipated second series.Viewers will see Game of Thrones actor Ian McElhinney and comedian Tommy Tiernan as Granda Joe and Da Gerry go off on some undisclosed caper in Burt, Co Donegal.Part of the newsagentrsquos shop and cafe was transformed into a grungy taxi office for two days of filming which took place at the end of last October.The Cable Bar, which is just feet away from the shop, is also featured in the scene.With old petrol pumps outside the shop, vintage tractors and an ice-cone sign, the Wee Shop looked authentic for the filming and should spark nostalgia for viewers of Donegal holidays for years past.The five young teens which star in the surprise Netflix hit set in s Derry mdash actors Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee OrsquoDonnell, Dylan Llewellyn and Louisa Harland mdash were not involved in the filming.Channel rsquos Derry Girls, written by Lisa McGee, attracted an average two million audience per episode for its first series last year.

They came in and created a stud wall and painted the walls brown on the bottom and cream on the top and then distressed it to make it look as it had years of smoke on it.ldquoWith the ious props and bits and pieces, it really looked the part, he added.Brendan revealed that it was pure fate that led to the producers to ask to film there.He also insisted that the programme retained the shoprsquos name.ldquoA couple of guys were just out and about scouting around and thought that my shop was just what they were after for that scene, he explained.ldquoWhen they came in to discuss the matter, it turned out that one of the worked for me when I was a bar manager years ago up north.ldquoThey reimbursed me for two days of business and I felt that was fine because Irsquom hoping that there may be a spin-off for me with new customers once the programme airs.bull Episode three of Derry Girls airs on Tuesday at .pm on Channel ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Designer meets with Duchess again during Empire Bar visit  ","story":"SAINTFIELD fashion designer Meabh Mageean has the ear mdash and the eye mdash of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.The  year-old was lucky to meet the Duchess for the second time when she visited Belfast with her husband recently.It was natural that their chat turned to weddings and clothes, given that one is regarded as the best-dressed Royal in the world and the other is an up and coming fashion designer.Meabh had been asked to meet the Duchess at an celebration of achievement of young people at the Empire bar.She had previously met with her last February at a fashion event in Buckhingham Palace.ldquoI was asked to meet and talk to the Duchess about that event and my own work, explained Meabh.ldquoShe was interested to know what I brought back from last yearrsquos event andit enhanced my business.

No one thought this was going to happen.Mrs Trainor believes the Downe is capable of accommodating both ENT day surgery and the proposed cataract service, given that it is relatively modern hospital, boasting a range of high tech, diagnostic equipment and theatres.She added: ldquoIt simply beggars belief that we are to lose a key day surgery for people with ear, nose and throat problems. The loss is compounded by the fact that local hospital campaigners were not informed this was happening or asked for their views.Last week, a South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed there were no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Farmers opposed to geopark plans  ","story":"PLANS to secure world renowned tourism branding for an area stretching from Strangford Lough to South Armagh have been dealt a major blow this week.As Newry, Mourne and Down Council prepares to submit a bid to secure prestigious UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union has labelled the proposal a ldquonon starter.Consultants have been working on the councilrsquos bid for geopark status ahead of a formal application being made this November.Supporters of the ambitious plan insist that securing geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geopark branding is one of the key planks of the local authorityrsquos tourism strategy with those involved in the process confident it has the potential to increase the number of international visitors to the area.However, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union mdash whose representatives met recently with local authority officials and representatives from Geological Survey NI mdash says farmers are ldquounanimously opposed to the geopark.While it has been suggested that securing geopark branding could potentially be worth in the region of poundm for local tourism, the farmersrsquo union says it is ldquofar from impressed at the assertion that the designation will bring increased recreational opportunities and promote social inclusion.UFU deputy president Victor Chestnutt said farmers in the Newry, Mourne and Down area were were ldquofar from impressed with promises made by officials they met recently.The UFU official continued: ldquoI would like to remind these officials that farmers have been the custodians of the land for hundreds of years. Imposing a designation on this area will affect their livelihoods which will have a knock-on effect on all ratepayers in the area.ldquoCouncil officials believe and are promoting that this designation will not restrict the operations of any farmer. This is unrealistic and their approach is disappointing.ldquoWe are % opposed to these plans and I would urge the council to meet our members, listen to their concerns and reconsider their plans to progress with such an application.Mr Chestnutt is encouraging local authority officials to provide figures to UFU members to support claims that geopark branding will help grow farm businesses, confirming that until farmers see the figures in black and white, they will continue to dispute any such claims.The UFU vice-president said with local government elections fastapproaching, the organisation believes the time is right to review any proposed geopark application.He continued: ldquoThe UFU has made contact with each of the parties and all independent councillors who currently hold seats on Newry, Mourne and Down Council and it is disappointing that only a very small number have taken the time to listen and engage with us. We have many members residing and working in the area and some councillors have missed a genuine opportunity to engage with their constituents.The senior union official said the ldquostigma around the Mournes national park debate a number of years ago is still very much at the forefront of farmersrsquo minds, explaining that at the time, UFU members were united in their opposition to the proposals.Mr Chestnutt said the UFU believed that farmers who live and work in the area should decide whether or not an area is suitable for national park or global geopark status.He said the council had put nothing on the table to reassure members and encourage them to reverse their position.With tourism one of the key drivers behind the geopark branding, Mr Chestnutt said Tourism NI was ldquovisibly absent from any discussions.He said farmers believed tourism in the area could be developed without the need to introduce a special designation.ldquoThe funding and resources the council has earmarked for the development and operation of the proposed new geopark should be redirected to the general promotion of tourism and infrastructure development. We are in favour of economic development but securing geopark status is not the way to do it, he declared.Mr Chestnutt added: ldquoOur message is simple and direct ndash farmers in the area are strongly opposed to the geopark proposal and I would urge all councillors, council officials and the Geological Survey of NI to fully and meaningfully engage with us.ldquoThe best course of action would be to rethink the geopark proposal and focus tourism investment into wider promotion of our beautul countryside.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council said the geopark had the potential to make a ldquosignicant contribution to local communities and tourism in the Mourne, Ring of Gullion and Strangford and Lecale areas.ldquoIt is important to understand that a geopark is not a legislative designation and will therefore not place any restrictions on economic activity within the proposed areas, including on any farming practices, he said.ldquoThe introduction of a geopark will not introduce additional planning restrictions and instead will simply provide an globally recognised accreditation.ldquoThe geopark will only include sites which already have public access and the geopark will not promote any access to private land, unless the landowner in question wants to work with the geopark.The spokesman added: ldquoThe process to achieve geopark designation is ongoing and it is not until  that an accreditation would be confirmed as part of this ongoing process.ldquoIn the meantime, the council will continue to deliver events and activities to increase awareness of what the project represents and how it can grow our tourism offering and support our local communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash THE Earl of Clanwilliamrsquos th century mansion and -acre estate at Montalto, Ballynahinch, officially goes on sale today.

Almost immediately the perfect skull complete with teeth was removed to prevent damage and a process of dating the skeleton began.The farmer wishes to keep his identity and the location of the field unknown in an effort to prevent vandalism and damage to nearby fields which have been planted with early potatoes.This was the first time that the field had been ploughed in recent years and this, combined with the severe frosts and natural erosion, contributed to the moving of the skeleton closer to the surface.The site of the finding is referred to a history of Killyleagh written in  which states that human bones had been found in the area before and that there were others known to lie there.According to the history the tradition is that they are the bones of Protestants who during the rebellion of  were chased by the native Irish and were massacred.BALLYGOWAN mdash Five year-old Tara Rhodes, who has several relatives in Ballygowan, has flown to America with her father in a frantic bid for emergency treatment.Tara, who has a brain tumour which has already left her blind mdash is preparing to undergo treatment which will cost about pound,.The money has been collected through a special fund which was set up last November by Tararsquos mother, Sara, who was told by doctors that her daughter had only six months to live.Despite the claims of medical experts, Tararsquoa anguished parents launched a UK-wide appeal campaign, which included a special charity dance in Ballygowan.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Plans to shut down Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have been ditched by the Department of Education.The small country school, which is  years old and caters for  children, has escaped the threat of closure and is expected to undergo a modernisation programme soon.Earlier this year the Department suggested that the school should be closed, but pressure from the schoolrsquos management committee has led to a reversal of plans.The Department thought that it may be better to close the school because it lacked many facilities and was not up to modern day standard.The Rev Dr W D Bailie, chairman of the management committee, protested bitterly and called on the support of the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Dr Bailie said: ldquoWe are delighted that the Department has responded to our plea to permit the school to continue to cater for the educational needs of this area.CROSSGAR mdash Preparations are well under way for the big Easter fair to be held in Crossgar War Memorial Hall on April .

Parking around the Bridge Street and Mount Crescent area is limited, she remarked.ldquoWe do not encourage students to drive to school. When they do, students are advised through sixth-form year assemblies that there are residential homes in the area and due consideration needs to be given to that. We advise them that they should park with care and consideration and within the law and they are reminded not to park on the pavement.ldquoPupils who drive a car to school provide us with their car details. Should a complaint be left by a member of the public, we attempt to identy the driver and address the issue.Mrs Perry added that this was currently a ldquospike time of the school year for student drivers as it combined both pupils from its upper sixth year who have been driving for upwards of a year and lower sixth pupils who had recently passed their driving tests..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Posnett powers Saul to cosy win  ","story":"TEAM Saul claimed victory in the CosyRoof Winter League at St Patrickrsquos Golf Club.Saul were led by captain Phil Posnett and Donard, who they beat in the final, were headed by deputy captain captain Gerry Reilly.After poor weather on Saturday it was Saul that were quickest out of the blocks come Sunday morning with Phil and Ed Baggley snr both shooting  points.These scores were quickly followed by their team-mates Joe Deegan withand Lawrence Craig with  points.The champagne was now chilling nicely, particularly as the first two Donard scores from Gerry Reilly with  points and Bill Dunlop with  points, made no inroads into Saulrsquos  total.In the early afternoon the drama began to unfold as Joe OrsquoNeill shot an incredible  points to bring Donard within touching distance of the prize.

Bryansfordrsquos Chris Brannigan was the lsquogo torsquo man for vital scores and Carryduffrsquos Ronan Lawlor won a Colleges All-Star award that year.Previous wins in the competition came in ,  and  with the teams of lsquo and lsquo going on to win the All Ireland Collegesrsquo B final.Cathair Dhoire may not have the same sort of identity or history as the Red High, but they will still be a tough nut to crack.The Red Highrsquos campaign didnrsquot start that well and they lost their opening group game - to - when Our and Lady and St Patrickrsquos, Knock, edged past them by the narrowest of margins.They picked up a bit of momentum following a comprehensive - to - victory over St Patrickrsquos, Keady.This was followed up by a - to - win over St Louisrsquo, Ballymena, before a - to - extra-time victory against St Malachyrsquos, Castlewellan, in the quarter-finals.St Louisrsquo, Ballymena, were their semi-final opponents, but they were no match for the Red High flair and went down - to -.Meanwhile, Cathair Dhoire enjoyed wins over Our Ladyrsquos, Castleblaney, Our Ladyrsquos and St Patrickrsquos, Knock, and Inis Eoghan, Donegal, on their way to the final. In addition, the St Columbrsquos players in the squad were also involved with their schoolrsquos senior team that won this seasonrsquos Markey Cup.The Derry side are blessed with a plethora of talented players, none more so than Ben McCarron, a highly-rated forward who played for his county in this yearrsquos McKenna Cup.St Patrickrsquos will look to their defensive markers, Eoin Rooney and Jack Harbinson, while skipper Ronan Murphy, Ciaran Watson and Peter McMullan will hope to turn defence into attack.Murphy is really looking forward to the final and believes that his team-mates have all the hard yards done in training.ldquoWe are really looking forward to the final. This is one of the reasons we all play the game. It makes all the hard work and effort worthwhile, he said.ldquoPreparations are going well. I canrsquot fault the lads, everyone is putting in a sht and getting out to training. Hopefully, all the hard work will pay off.ldquoWe donrsquot really know much about Cathair Dhiore as all year we have just concentrated on our game and what we need to do. They obviously have good players to get this far with a few lads who have won Ulster Colleges All Star awards and played senior football for Derry, so, we know they are pretty decent.He continued: Getting to the final has created a real buzz and itrsquos infectious. Everyone in the school is looking forward to it. The school is covered in maroon and gold and itrsquos just class as it sends good vibes all around the place.ldquoFormer players and coaches have been wishing us well and it has been great to see them involved as the Red High has a huge history and tradition in Ulster Collegesrsquo football.St Patrickrsquos have potential match winners all over the park and in Tim Prenter mdash a regular starter in the countyrsquos senior hurling team mdash Ruairi OrsquoHare, Brandon Boyd, Tom Smyth and Niall Laverty they have players capable of winning games on their own.Red High coach Declan Morgan believes that his charges have what it takes to go all the way this year.ldquoWe have been training exceptionally hard, but the boys enjoy the work and there is a great camaraderie in the squad, he said.ldquoThere is pace and mobility all over the pitch and we have defenders that can negate Cathair Dhoirersquos scoring threat. Our lads all know the job they have to do. We have invested a lot in this squad and they have responded brilliantly.ldquoHowever, there is no guarantee in football and know we have a lot to do to get our hands on the cup, he added.ldquoWe havenrsquot mentioned the fact that we are already through to the All-Ireland Collegesrsquo B semi-finals, regardless of Mondayrsquos outcome, as amalgamated schools are unable to compete in that competition.ldquoThe boys are focused totally on winning on Monday and they will not be taking their eye off the ball.The final is still a long way off for several players who face a weekend of action in other sports.ldquoWe canrsquot wrap up the boys in cotton wool, but I will be on the phone on Saturday night to several of the players to ensure they havenrsquot picked up any injuries, Mr Morgan said.ldquoHowever, we have a  strong  and they have all bought into the team ethos and our horses for courses policy.ldquoThe lads are so looking forward to the final and are fully aware of the schoolrsquos history in the competition.He added: Itrsquos been a while since the MacLarnon Cup was in Downpatrick, but I am convinced this squad can bridge that gap and bring the trophy back to the Red High for the first time in  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"St Michael’s are champions  ","story":"ST Michaelrsquos wrapped up the - league title with two matches to spare when they overcame visiting St Patrickrsquos.

Those people talk of her apparent lack of remorse for joining Islamic State, which she did in  when she left her East London home as a -year-old and travelled to Syria. Others, including myself feel somewhat sympathetic towards her.I am abhorred by the views she holds but I donrsquot believe her decision to leave her home and her family and travel to Syria is a story without complexities. I see a vulnerable child who was radicalised by extremists while on British soil, in an area of East London I used to call home. I see a young teenager who was married to an IS fighter within two weeks of arriving in Syria and has been brainwashed perhaps beyond repair after witnessing levels of violence and destruction that most of us wouldnrsquot even be able to contemplate. But most tragic of all, I see a young mother who, at just  years of age, has lost three children in the space of four years. To me, thatrsquos an unimaginable level of trauma. And no, she doesnrsquot deserve it. No one deserves such pain.Irsquom not condoning her actions or her behaviour. She should face the legal consequences of her actions. She should be tried in a British court for the crimes she has allegedly committed. That is, after all, why we have the rule of law. But wiping our hands of her and failing to act to protect her son before he died of pneumonia in a grim refugee camp, shows just how much, as a country, the UK has lost its moral compass.Irsquove heard a number of commentators conflating her situation with that of the hundreds of innocent people whorsquove suffered at the hands of IS, particularly the vulnerable Yazidi women who were captured and are now being used as sex slaves. The dference, of course, is that they did not sign up to be a part of the caliphate, like Ms Begum. I am equally horried by the plight of these women and their children.But why do incidents such as this one always come back to whataboutery  Nothing was ever solved by this derailing and deflection technique. It is hypocritical to suggest we should have cared less about Ms Begumrsquos three-week-old baby than those captured or indeed killed by IS. Innocent people are innocent people and we should care equally about each and every one.Just because there are innocent victims still at the behest of ISIS does not negate the fact that the rights of a baby have been ignored and that child has now died, a death that couldrsquove been prevented by the Home Secretary, Savid Javid, had he chosen compassion and humanity over appeasement and pandering to rising populism.Indeed, Ms Begumrsquos case has highlighted a dilemma facing many countries in Europe, ided over whether to allow IS members or supporters to come home and face prosecution or block them. In the Republic, the Irish government may soon have to decide whether to intervene in the case of Lisa Smith, the Dundalk woman who travelled to Syria a number of years ago to join IS.She now has a two-year-old son and the pair are staying in the Al Hawl camp for the family members of Isis fighters.It is sadly too late for Ms Begumrsquos son. But there are countless other children in similar circumstances andnothing , this story should serve as a timely reminder that children are not to blame for their parentsrsquo actions.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

I think thatrsquos a shameful view to take.Despite my long running campaign with our Labour Police and Crime Commissioner, the Tories have yet to ensure fair funding for Cardf and for South Wales Police.Officers here are doing a great job across south Wales, in community centres, schools and shops, raising awareness of kne crime and the dangers of carrying a kne.But just last week the Chief Constable stressed thatproperly funded to cover the needs of policing a capital city with the additional pressures that presents, he could put  additional officers onto issues such as this.Itrsquos simply not good enough from the Prime Minister, when kne crime is on the increase.Meanwhile my constituency appointments included a visit to the Salvation Army-run T# Gobaith Lehouse just across the Bay, to see how they are helping people rebuild their lives and escape homelessness.I spoke to some of the people who are staying at the centre having become homeless for a whole range of reasons, and heard some incredible stories of lives being turned around.It was inspiring to hear how, thanks to the dedicated staff, they are getting a fresh start in le, building up their confidence through le skills training, adult education and counselling.I was also delighted that our Penarth and Vale Labour councillors have been fighting to secure an agreement from the Vale of Glamorgan Council to allocate funds to ensure the a b bus services through Llandough, including the hospital, can continue. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The seniors school can be found on Hickman Road, the juniors and nursery a short distance on in Victoria Road.School facilities include a full gym, a library, an IT suite, a sports hall, science laboratories, and nearby access to local sports facilities including athletics track, Penarth RFCrsquos rugby pitch and the International Sports Village in Cardf Bay.Traditionally the school was strictly boys only. However, in the mid s the decision was taken to also accept girls and become a coeducational school.Westbourne was first established in Penarth in  as Westbourne House Preparatory School for Boys, and has kept the choice for children to board.A number of international students attend the school, and they often board with families from the area ndash usually Westbourne alumni themselves. More than  dferent nationalities take the opportunity to board in the area.Westbourne are rightly proud of this international aspect.ldquoEveryone here mixes in together, said Marie de Tito Mount, the schoolrsquos director of marketing. ldquoWe have children studying from Russia, China, the US, Poland, India, and theyrsquore all friends.ldquoTherersquos no cliques or groups, and wersquore proud of the international aspect this is giving our children.ldquoWe feel like wersquore making them citizens of the world.Ranked st in Wales by The Sunday Times Schools Guide and st in the UK by The DailyLeague Tables,  per cent of Westbourne graduates go to Russell Group universities or equivalently elite international institutions.The school points to two factors for this ndash the small number of pupils, and the highly trained staff.With a class size of just eight students per teacher on average, every student gets full and unided attention.The children clearly thrive from this, building confidence and passion for their work.In reception, there was a palpable excitement to show off their handmade vegetable dolls.A Year Five jumped at the chance to read out her ndash impressively well-written ndash poem.In the senior school, a young man attacked a maths problem on a board with gusto. He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too. More than  per cent of teachers at Westbourne have a PhD or masters and more than  per cent have taught internationally.Westbourne School has cultivated a warm and highly supportive culture one in which students and teachers truly support each other.For more information, visit:https:www.westbourneschool Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquove already passed the legislation to provide for a no-deal Brexit, we have the Common Travel Area and this package of measures to support incomes and jobs.ldquoItrsquos not going to be a case of everything being all right, Brexit is bad news.#Welcomed @eucopresident# Donald Tusk back to #@merrionstreet# today to discuss #Brexit and #FutureofEurope before this weekrsquos #important @EUCouncil# meeting pic IvDfuAcyBmdash Leo VaradkarMarch , Mr Varadkar also said he hoped his discussions with Mr Tusk could help avoid a ldquorolling extension.He added: ldquoI will have a chance to speak to him in more detail at that point and I would hope that things over the next couple of days may become a bit clearer in terms of what Westminster wants and what the British Government wants.ldquoIrsquove always said that what I would like to avoid is a rolling extension, where there is an extension every few months, that would just add to uncertainty and wouldnrsquot solve the problem.ldquoThere seems to be two emerging possibilities ndash one would be the ratication of the Withdrawal Agreement by Westminster followed by a short extension into the summer which would allow them time to pass the necessary legislation or potentially a much longer extension of up to two years and the purpose of that would be to allow other options to be considered, for example participation in Customs Union.Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow provoked uproar at Westminster on Monday when he ruled that the Government could not bring the Prime Ministerrsquos deal back for a third ldquomeaningful vote unless there were substantial changes.The Speakerrsquos ruling was welcomed by some Tory Brexiteers opposed to Theresa Mayrsquos deal, who argued that it increased the chances of a no-deal break.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has indicated ministers will continue to press on with Mrs Mayrsquos Brexit deal despite Mr Bercowrsquos ruling..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Donald Tusk meets Leo Varadkar in Dublin for Brexit talks article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Then to handler Gerry Cosgrave to get the horse ready for his first point to point race.Thrills abounded when his black and red colours were chosen and on April , , Battleoverdoyen won his first race at Loughanmore with jockey Mark O’Hare.Michael recalls his phone never stopped on the way home and the next day the cream of racing were looking to buy the winner.He decided to go to the prestigious Tattersalls sales in Cheltenham the following week and the horse, was set at a reserve for £,.After a buzzing sales ring it sold to the powerhouse Gigginstown stud, owned by the O’Leary’s of Ryanair fame, for a whopping £,.Michael recalls it wasn’t about the money.

Over the years Goal Line has worked with young people who have had a wide range of disabilities including Autism, Asperger’s Syndrome, ADHD , Down’s Syndrome, developmental delays, speech and other problems.In order to benefit from the PHA CLEAR Grant, Goal Line opted for a number of self-initiatives based around art and creative therapies, and several physical activity programmes that tested the young people in the sports hall in a iety of activities and team challenges.The young people benefitted from, and thoroughly enjoyed, a wide range of activities which saw personal development and well-being very much to the fore.Youth Support Worker Maxine Chambers said: “For the young people, being able to work in a group and develop their confidence and then to be able to voice their opinions and their own interpretation of things has been fantastic through Jason’s workshops. Through Trevor’s ceramic flower work it was a chance for them to deal with sensory issues, overcome issues with messy clay and that sort of thing.“Some of them were afraid to get their hands dirty or put them into the clay but when they saw people doing it they knew that it was ok. And when it came to painting the flowers it was brilliant, they loved all that – the outcome was superb and they were delighted to see what actually came at the end of the project with the flowers forever, flowers for their parents and the parents were amazed that the children had made those.“The fitness sessions were great in getting them into the sports hall and getting them involved in activities that they may not have tried before or at all – the New Age curling and boccia were good examples and it was good to see them having great fun indoors in something they can all do.”The grant also enabled Goal Line to facilitate a talk about strategies for dealing with dficult behaviours in young people. The talk was given by Dr Kate Kirk, a psychodrama psychotherapist from the Isle of Man. It was well attended by family, principals of primary schools, teachers, Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators, social workers, doctors and youth workers.

INLM-gcOften her fees were waived for those who might struggle to pay and the respect she was held in the town was unparalleled.Rosemary came to prominence as the solicitor for some high profile republicans, including Colin Duffy.She also represented the family of Robbie Hamill who was killed after a barbaric kicking in Portadown in .She also worked as a solictor for the Garvaghy Residents Association during the Drumcree disputes in Portadown in the late s.However the vast majority of her clients were ordinary local people.Rosemary was killed in March ,  after a bomb exploded under her car outside her home close to a local primary school in Lurgan.The murder was claimed by the loyalist gang, the Red Hand Defenders however there was widespread concern of security force collusion in the murder.Mrs Nelson had previously complained that she had received numerous death threats and had voiced these concerns with the United Nations and US Congress.A public inquiry into her murder found no evidence that the security forces had ‘directlly facilitated’ her murder but ‘could not exclude the possibility’ that inidual members had helped the perpetrators.On her th anniversary her children paid tribute to their mother.In a statement on Friday they said: “Today marks the th anniversary of the passing of prominent human rights lawyer, Rosemary Nelson.

Even in her younger years she noted that the odds were stacked, but that didn’t stop her from hurtling towards opportunities and dismantling the obstacles anyway – for herself, and others, too.“For those who witnessed Rosemary in a professional setting, it was her steely faith which drew attention – that unfaltering conviction which commanded her working days. She instilled belief in her clients, and they in turn placed their confidence in her. “When it comes to the many at the receiving end of Rosemary’s help, it’s hard to determine just what their lingering memories are – but perhaps that’s the point. Through the power of her compassion, the four walls of the Lurgan office transformed into a confidential haven whereupon sadness was shielded fears unleashed and faith restored.“But for those closest to Rosemary – and lucky enough to occupy that special, padlocked component of her heart – she was so, so much more. “She sprinkled her laughter and zest-for-le passion upon any occasion, and set more than one meal alight during her cooking forays.“Though Rosemary’s driving was impressive, her sense of direction left a lot to be desired, and the sounds of the Lighthouse Family and Mary Black were the backdrop of choice to any long journey.“She loved her family and friends fiercely, and through her parents, siblings, husband, and children, her greatest fuel was forged.“And as the darkness of each night reared, Rosemary gathered her children before her as she wiped off her make-up chatting, laughing, and ensuring that a reaffirmation of love lulled them off to a peaceful sleep.“Today on the th anniversary, we’re hugely saddened as we reflect on the loss of Rosemary’s le. We grieve for the milestones which we should have shared the lessons which we were yet to learn the unwritten chapters which lay before us with hope and expectation.“But mostly we’re grateful for the blessings which Rosemary’s letime brought us. And as we continue to pave our own paths, we will always take fuel from her, just as she did from us.“Thank you, mum. We miss you.”Also on her anniversary some of her colleagues paid tribute to Mrs Nelson.KRW Law Human Rights said: “Thoughts and prayers with the family and friends of our esteemed professional colleague Rosemary Nelson on the th anniversary of her murder.”Madden  Finucane Solicitors said: “Fond memories of our friend and colleague Rosemary Nelson on the th anniversary of her murder.T”oday marks the th anniversary of the passing of prominent human rights lawyer, Rosemary Nelson.

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists. Depending on how the UK leaves the EU, motorists in Northern Ireland may need a Green Card to drive across the border. A Green Card is an international certicate of insurance issued by insurance providers in the UK, guaranteeing that the driver has the necessary third-party motor insurance cover for driving in the country being travelled to. In the event of a no deal Brexit, motorists in Northern Ireland travelling to the Republic of Ireland will need a Green Card as proof of insurance. There’s also the most up-to-date information from the Department of Health on prescriptions, medicines and medical supplies. The Department of Health has already said that there is enough medicines and medical products to meet current needs. Therefore people should not ask for longer prescriptions and should continue to follow their GP’s advice. Likewise, arrangements for the provision of specic cross border healthcare services made between the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health in Dublinshould not be affected by EU Exit as they are not based on EU legislation.
