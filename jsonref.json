It only led to 44 cases in the UK before disappearing. Instead of recombination, new Covid variants generally emerge on their own. SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the pandemic, constantly mutates and can pick up genetic quirks as it replicates.  In most cases the mutations are harmless, but occasionally they can make the virus more transmissible or better able to evade vaccines as is the case with the Omicron variant. Omicron has 32 mutations on its spike proteins alone, nearly five times more than Delta.Claims of the emergence of a new Deltacron variant came a lab in Cyprus which has reportedly submitted its findings to GISAID, an international database that tracks different Covid variants and their spread. Cyprus currently has one of the highest Covid cases per head of population rates in the world.  Stats compiled by Oxford University-backed research team Our World in Data shows that as of yesterday Cyprus recorded 5050 daily Covid cases per million people.This is nearly double the amount of the UK which recorded 2,607 daily cases per million people on the same date. "},{"url":null,"title":"Volatile Bitcoin low price 40 000 losing 40 value two months","story":"Share this article \u0027If they\u0027re going to hike rates three times in 2022 and keep the program, and the era of low rates is over, we\u0027re going to really see how much people believed in their Bitcoin-crypto thesis,\u0027 said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive and co-founder of crypto platform FRNT Financial Inc. \u0027I would expect that the Fed getting more and more hawkish is very bad for valuations.\u0027Bitcoin, in particular, has been trading more in sync with the S\u0026ampP 500 over the last calendar year.

All non-essential businesses have been closed, outbound travel restricted and a mass-testing drive has been launched “to respond to the severe epidemic control situation and strictly prevent the spread of the Omicron virus outbreak”, Xinhua reported. There were 58 new local infections reported in Anyang, state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, bringing the city’s total caseload to 84 since Saturday. It was not immediately clear whether the new cases were tied to the Omicron variant.  At least three cities in Henan are battling emerging outbreaks, with provincial capital Zhengzhou closing schools and kindergartens, and stopping restaurants from accepting dine-in customers. Last week, one million people in the city of Yuzhou were put under stay-at-home orders. Elsewhere, Tianjin - a major port city just 150 kilometres from Beijing - has barred people from leaving without official permission, ordered the testing of all 14 million residents, and cancelled trains into the capital. Tianjin confirmed another 10 new locally transmitted cases after citywide mass testing. The northern city of Xi’an is in its third week of lockdown as it attempts to stamp out a 2,000-case outbreak. And after logging a handful of cases in recent days, Shenzhen - a southern tech hub just across the border from Hong Kong - has locked down some housing compounds, launched a mass-testing initiative and shuttered some long-distance bus stations.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) previously said the isolation period was in effect the same in both countries. It said the recommended minimum of six full days in the UK was counted from the onset of symptoms, while in the US, the five-day isolation began from the day of a positive test, which could be several days after the first symptoms. However, the UKHSA has updated its blogpost, which now states: “In the UK our advice is to self-isolate for at least six full days from the point at which you have symptoms or get a positive test, whichever is first.” It continued: “In the United States, the advice is to isolate for at least five full days from the same point.” The deal approved late on Monday would have students in class Wednesday and teachers back a day earlier. It still requires approval with a vote of the union’s roughly 25,000 members.  Issues on the table have been metrics to close schools amid outbreaks and expanded Covid testing, the Associated Press reported. Neither side immediately disclosed full details of the proposal on Monday evening, but leaders generally said the agreement included measures to close inidual schools and plans to boost district Covid testing. The district notified parents in the largely low-income black and Latino school district of about 350,000 students that classes would resume Wednesday. “We know this has been very difficult for students and families,” mayor Lori Lightfoot said at an evening news conference. “Some will ask who won and who lost. No one wins when our students are out of the place where they can learn the best and where they’re safest.” Fears over the Covid variant meant that, from late November, all travellers arriving in the UK were required to take a pre-departure lateral flow test and self-isolate until they received a negative result from a post-arrival PCR test. This led to many people scrapping their travel plans over the festive period, PA Media reported. The new rules were relaxed for fully vaccinated arrivals last week after travel firms said they were ineffective due to Omicron spreading widely within the UK. “I can understand the hurt that these reports, these allegations, will have caused, particularly for those who’ve lost loved ones,” junior health minister Edward Argar told Sky News on Tuesday following a new report of alleged rule breaking, adding it was right that Johnson had previously commissioned a civil servant to investigate similar allegations. “It wouldn’t be appropriate … for me to comment on those ongoing conversations or her ongoing investigation. We’ve got to give a space to conclude that investigation.”Screening programmes for these less survivable cancers do not exist and many people are unaware of the symptoms. LSCT chairwoman Anna Jewell said:  India reported 168,063 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, a 20-fold rise in a month despite testing being well below capacity. However, most infected people have recovered at home and the level of hospitalisations has been less than half of that seen during the last major wave of infections in April and May. Many states have announced night curfews while the capital Delhi has also imposed a weekend lockdown, closed private offices as well as restaurants and bars in a bid to rein in the fast-spreading Omicron variant. But tens of thousands of pilgrims have already reached the site of the annual Ganges ritual on an island in the eastern state of West Bengal, which is reporting the most number of cases in the country after Maharashtra state in the west. “The crowd may swell to anywhere between 800,000 to one million. We are trying to implement all Covid protocols,” Bankim Chandra Hazra, a West Bengal minister in charge of organising the festival known as the Gangasagar Mela, told Reuters. We begin with news that people living in the England who test positive for Covid on a lateral flow device but do not develop symptoms will no longer need to take a PCR test to confirm their result while they self-isolate. The new approach has now come into force after it was announced last week by the UK Health Security Agency, Sky News reported. Most people who receive positive lateral flow results can now be confident they have Covid, with infection rates high across the country, according to health chiefs. Linda Geddes, the ’s science correspondent, attempts to answer this question in light of recent warnings from experts that viral evolution is not a one-way street and a continuing fall in virulence cannot be taken for granted.  The pandemic has been awash with slogans, but in recent weeks, two have been repeated with increasing frequency: “Variants will evolve to be milder” and “Covid will become endemic”.  Read the full story here. In an interview with broadcaster TVN24, health minister Adam Niedzielski announced the grim milestone, saying: “Today we can say it is another sad day, but especially so because we have passed the level of 100,000 Covid deaths.” An additional 11,400 coronavirus infections and 493 deaths were recorded in the last 24 hour reporting period, local media report.  Ukraine also reported another 5,429 new confirmed coronavirus cases and 219 deaths, according to health ministry data.The Labour peer George Foulkes complained to the commissioners on 6 January after the  reported that leaked files appear to suggest Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man-based financier Douglas Barrowman, were secretly involved in the company, PPE Medpro. After the company was awarded contracts in May and June 2020, Mone and Barrowman have consistently denied any “role or function” in PPE Medpro. Lawyers for Mone, who ran the lingerie company Ultimo before David Cameron made her a peer in 2015, have said she “was not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity”. Read the full story here.

Beginning today, passengers on long-haul flights from the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Australia and New Zealand will be given a rapid PCR test at the airport immediately upon arrival.  Those who test positive will be taken directly to hospital with their luggage. Those who test negative will be allowed to continue through the arrival process, which includes a non-rapid PCR test at the airport (with results sent later), being sprayed with disinfectant, and put in designated transport to a quarantine hotel or facility. Health and welfare minister Chen Shih-chung said: Taiwan’s entry requirements are already extraordinarily strict. No non-residentscitizens are allowed in without prior exemption, and everyone must have a negative PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before their flight. On arrival passengers are tested and ordered into a quarantine hotel or government facility for 14 days (or currently, temporarily, for seven, if they have an eligible home they can complete the second seven days in). They then have another seven days of self-health management avoiding crowds and restaurants. Across the three weeks they must have three PCR tests and three rapid tests. Taiwan has been one of the world’s most successful preventers of large-scale outbreaks and recently went more than a month without a single locally transmitted case. However with Omicron spreading around the world, and higher numbers of arrivals due to the Lunar New Year festival at the end of the month, there has been a rise in imported cases and a domestic cluster of at least 31 people linked to the international airport. Six new local cases were reported on Monday. Mask rules have been tightened again, with exceptions removed for exercise, giving speeches, taking photos and other specific circumstances. People can still take their mask off in some scenarios, including eating or drinking at venues, in forest recreation areas, and in spas and saunas.China has reported some cases of the Omicron variant as it battles small-scale outbreaks in several regions, less than a month before the Games are due to kick off on 4 February. The “closed-loop” bubble, in which participants can only leave if they are exiting the country or undergo quarantine, was activated earlier in January. Restrictions at Games venues in Beijing and Zhangjiakou in neighbouring Hebei province will be much tighter than those during last summer’s Tokyo Olympics.But organisers have room to make adjustments to Covid-19 control measures if necessary, said Huang, at a briefing in Beijing. As in Tokyo, no international spectators will be allowed at the Beijing Winter Games, and local attendance at event sites is likely to be curtailed, although specific arrangements have not been released. Trudeau made the comments in a call with Canada’s provincial and territorial premiers. Trudeau said the government also plans to deliver 140 million rapid Covid tests to provinces and territories in January, according to the statement. Of the new local cases, 87 were reported in Henan, 13 in Shaanxi, and 10 in Tianjin, the commission said.  A further 82 new imported cases were detected in 11 provincial-level regions, according to the commission.

Photograph: iStockA year ago you surely imagined, and hoped, that life would be very different now from how it was for us then. And yet as we embark on both a new term and a new calendar year we face some old familiar questions.According to John F Kennedy, “Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.” It would seem that your journey as a leader during Covid is far from over. As we step into 2022 we are also at a point in the academic year which offers you an opportunity to reflect on what you have learned.We hear about school leaders being under pressure, but what do any of us do about it? Hopelessly little, quite frankly, because we all feel under pressure too.When last term drew to a close there was more talk of imminent lockdown than there was of plans for Christmas. During one breaktime in the staffroom, strong yet uninformed certainties were shared about how important it was to bring lots of school materials home for the break, ready for the inevitable online learning in January. And yet during this discussion I watched a school team leave to play an away match fixture. How many households mix every time that happens?Even when everybody knows that nobody knows what is truly happening, you as school leaders must nonetheless lead whole school communities. How you handle this is the ultimate test of the quality of your leadership. When it is the normal, run-of-the-mill stuff which typically happens in education settings there will always be someone to tell you how it should best be done.When all one has are guidelines and recommendations there is greater autonomy – which is usually a good thing. You are also not immune to the peer pressure attached to what you may be allowing in your school, compared to what neighbouring schools are permitting. When nobody knows precisely what the right thing to do is, iniduals must draw on their own leadership skillset and choose their own best course of action. If your definition of leadership is limited to telling people what to do, you perhaps also expect to be told what to do – a “you tell me and I’ll tell them” approach.Right now we have a serious substitution crisis in schools, and yet extra-curricular and other outings are taking place. Young people need these outlets and if regulations permit, why shouldn’t they avail of them?And yet for the remaining school personnel to be under additional and avoidable strain is anything but helpful for students. If Covid regulations allow students from different schools to meet for a match, it takes serious courage for a school leader to insist fixtures only take place when there is sufficient personnel to cover classes. And what constitutes sufficient personnel? Where one school may permit merging of smaller class groups, another may be rigidly opposed to anything which deviates from the usual, more predictable patterns of contact.The consequences of loose leadership are greater now that we are back in a state of urgency due to the Omicron variant. The relative freedoms we have been granted may come at a serious price. But to withdraw them involves the risk of paying heavily in other ways.As school leaders you are under pressure from those who want rigid care around Covid. But you are also under pressure from those who want the maximum possible levels of normality. So much here is a case of only being able to please some of the people some of the time.Having established that nobody really knows what to do, I can hardly try to tell you what to do. Instead I’ll offer areas worth exploring and reflecting on in the context of your learning about yourself as a leader. Whatever role you play in the context of your work, you bring that same self everywhere else with you too. Those closest to you as you move into your personal roles witness the ways in which your professional role affects you, both positively and negatively. The longer this period of your school leadership journey lasts, the more critical it is that you do not lose sight of who you are beyond that professional role. For you to remain strong enough to lead us effectively throughout 2022, we have an active part to play too. We are all in this together, aren’t we?And so we must demonstrate empathy. For too many people the most senior roles are first defined by the healthy pay scales which accompany them. There is a perception that this salary must be earned, and that it is best earned through suffering. As key stakeholders, it is for staff, students and parents to get the best “value for money” by ensuring that you are at the top of your game and delivering optimally for the school community. And so we can acknowledge your efforts, perhaps even dare to praise them. After all, we look to you to praise our inidual and team efforts, so why shouldn’t we occasionally send some praise your way?Self-awareness is often touted as an essential leadership skill. It is one that those you lead must also be prepared to demonstrate. We cannot talk one talk but walk a different walk. Not these days. Too much is uncertain for you, and to make the best decisions for your own specific school context you need clarity from us. To have limited certainties from above is one thing, but to have mixed messages from us as well quite another.As stakeholders we could do worse than to unite in a joint new year’s resolution to commit to supporting school leadership teams more fully as you continue to steer us through these choppy waters.Happy new year and thank you for all that you do."},{"url":null,"title":"state exams cannot go ahead as planned students union says","story":"‘We are calling on the Minister of Education to take students’ voices into account and revise the decision about State exams for 2022.’ Photograph: iStockThe State exams cannot go ahead as planned this year due to Covid-related disruption, the Irish Second-Level Students’ Union (ISSU) has said.Under current plans, students sitting the 2022 State exams would see adjustments and more choice on their exam papers to account for the pandemic impact on education over the past two years.There will also be two sets of Leaving Cert exams held during the summer to cater for those who are sick with Covid-19 or are in isolation.However, the union representing second-level students has called the decision to proceed with traditional exams a “complete disregard for students’ best interests”.Emer Neville, ISSU president, said this year’s cohort of exam students has been “very vocal about the disruption they are facing in and out of the classroom”.“There is no online tuition provided to those isolating, and students have missed class time throughout 2021 and 2020 as a result of school closures,” she said.“There is no way we can stand over assessing these students with the traditional Leaving Certificate. We are calling on the Minister of Education to take students’ voices into account and revise the decision about State exams for 2022.”Jack McGinn, ISSU education officer, acknowledged concerns that some students in this Leaving Cert cohort have not completed a Junior Cert, as junior-cycle data has been used for standardisation of predicted grades over the past two years.“However,” he said, “in light of the circumstances, we must put students first as it is their future that will be impacted.”The union is surveying students on the matter, with provisional results showing a clear favour towards a hybrid model, which is a choice between predicted grades or sitting the exams.The statement is a significant development on a building issue, with Labour and Sinn Féin having already called for the reintroduction of the hybrid model.Paul Crone, director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, said there needs to be something additional to this year’s exams to account for the Covid disruption.“We don’t know exactly what that should look like, or what’s possible, but what we’re saying is we should put students first,” he said.‘No justification’However, the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) and the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (ASTI) have both said they will only support the traditional, externally-assessed exams.On Monday, TUI said there was “no justification” to offer students additional options as schools have remained open throughout this academic year.The ASTI, meanwhile, said speculation on the use of previous one-off grading processes during the pandemic is “unhelpful”.The Department of Education said it is “ aware of the disruption” experienced by students who are due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022.“These are challenging times for all of society and it is acknowledged that the impact of the Omicron virus means that some students and teachers cannot currently attend school,” a spokesman added.However, the Department said the adjustments to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 Leaving Cert – including increased choice – were designed to take account of the disruption to learning last year, “as well as providing for some possible further disruption in 202122”.“The Department will continue to engage with all partners in education on all matters relating to Leaving Certificate 2022,” it added."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The small tortoiseshell can become confused by central heatingStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"mandatory vaccination not going to happen in the republic","story":"‘Officials are already concerned about the short duration of protection provided by booster shots against Omicron, which could be as low as five weeks.’ File photograph: GettyMandatory Covid-19 vaccination is the issue that refuses to go away.It remains under consideration by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), according to minutes of its meeting in mid-December.

Photograph: Andrew DownesPA Wire What did we learn from Day One of the Great Golfgate Trial?We found out that lawyers – if the legal heavyweights who turned up in force for a district court case in Galway are anything to go by – have a rather sniffy attitude to golf. Not quite their cup of tee.And that the Oireachtas Golf Society was a hitherto unrecognised major force in Irish political history until it hit the headlines last year due to the “Golfgate” furore.We learned that the size of a gap in a partition is a moveable feast. It certainly was moveable at the particular feast under the spotlight in Judge Mary Fahy’s courtroom on Thursday.We discovered that the annual President’s Prize dinner was not a “frivolous” event in 2020 and that the traditional presentation at the 19th hole after a convivial day on the links was anything but “a frolic”.That this event was, in fact, “poignant”. This is because it was held in honour of a politician who was behind the much-underestimated Golfing Revival Era in Irish politics 50 years ago. The late Mark Killilea was a driving force in the resurrection of the Oireachtas Golf Society, which had fizzled out after it was founded by a TD called Major Somethingorother in 1929.We heard that the then captain of the guard in Leinster House, an enthusiastic member of the society, had two breakfasts and one evening meal in the hotel which is now at the centre of this court case. And that a member of the Seanad and his wife left the dinner before the formalities commenced because “we’re not dessert people”.And that guidelines issued with the “imprimatur of the State” and bearing the harp of Rialtas na hÉireann on printed communications may, or may not be, worthless.We also learned on the opening day of the trial of politicians Noel Grealish and Donie Cassidy and hotel bosses John and James Sweeney for allegedly contravening the Covid emergency health act by holding a dinner indoors for over 50 people, that all of the witnesses called by the prosecution had nothing but praise for how the defendants managed the event.Bending the rulesThe story of the Oireachtas Golf Society’s now-infamous dinner hit the headlines late in 2020. In the early days of the pandemic, claims that politicians had been bending the strict rules painfully and dutifully observed by wider society caused uproar. But the lawyers acting for Grealish and Cassidy set out from the start to show how their clients acted with the utmost propriety at all times and their actions have been gravely misunderstood by the public.Which brings us back to something else learned on Thursday: when push comes to shove, it’s all the media’s fault. In this case, according to Donie Cassidy’s lawyer Colm Smyth SC, for getting involved and then “public hysteria was whipped up and hysteria was whipped up”.This, he said, led to “a lot of very good people” having “to resign from their positions”.Near the end of the first day, Martin Brett, a Fine Gael councillor from Kilkenny who was at the golf outing and dinner in Connemara, said he didn’t even know how many people were at the function until he read it in the paper.“Don’t believe what you read in the newspapers and the journal,” said Eoghan Cole BL, for the State.Barrister Cole was up against it. A lone ranger on the DPP’s side against the heavy guns hired by the defendants. The place was coming down with junior and senior counsel and instructing solicitors.Smyth, for Donie Cassidy, made the most running on day one, with bracing interventions from Senator Michael McDowell SC (for former PD colleague and now independent TD Noel Grealish) and the country’s leading libation lawyers Constance Cassidy and Eddie Walsh (for James and John Sweeney, respectively).Bewildering meanderThere isn’t much you can tell those two about the licensing laws. When Constance, in the midst of a bewildering meander through statutory instruments and hospitality regulations, talked about “the consumption of intoxicating liquor”, you knew it wasn’t the first time she said those words.Among the ranks of the BLs was junior counsel Willie Penrose, the former Labour TD. He is part of the Cassidy squad.As for the journalists sent to cover this trial of the half-century (50 years a-fourballing, and all that), there was no room in the court building for them. Two were allowed inside to hear the proceedings, the rest given a video link to download and hope for the best.Enter the hero of the hour: Fergal McGrath, brother of former TD Finian, who runs the Town Hall Theatre opposite the courthouse. Fergal made a room available to the hacks (which is more than the Courts Service could manage, despite this being a case of national interest which was flagged months ago).Business for Fergal has been hugely impacted by Covid, but he has a tasty line-up of events coming in the new year. The panto, sadly, had to be cancelled so all the kiddies in Galway missed out on the fairy godmother saying: “You shall go to the (golf) ball!”After a morning spent mostly in legal discussion, Colm Smyth got round to telling us of Donie Cassidy. A man who has never been before the courts in his life, has had a distinguished political career and is the owner of four hotels in Dublin, and that’s just for starters. “A lawmaker, not a lawbreaker.”Donie, in Colm’s words, sounded like Santa. Before the event, “he checked the regulations. He checked the guidelines.

His co-defendant, TD Noel Grealish, was captain on the night.No hand, act or putterMichael McDowell said this was very important because his client’s position is that president Cassidy organised the do as it was his dinner. Noel Grealish, as captain, had some involvement in organising the first day of golf but “I just want to be 100 per cent clear” he had no hand, act or putter in organising the shindig on the second night.Eddie and Constance, meanwhile, said that the “company” as opposed to the two Mr Sweeneys should have been charged.Then Colm Smyth started talking about “potentially an unsavoury aspect” to the prosecution, without explaining entirely what he meant.“Substantiate the unsavouryness,” challenged Eoghan Cole, for the State.The witnesses so far are all people who attended the golf dinner.They were blown away by the Covid prevention measures taken by management.The mainly retired minor politicians who attended this dinner were “exceptionally impressed”. But then, they don’t get out as much as they used to. There would be no “intermingling” at this hooley in Connemara.One of the guests recalled the rigid attention to the pandemic prevention rules on the night.“A waiter said to me: table service only. You don’t move unless you go to the toilet.”One of the lawyers pointed approvingly to “the liberality of sanitisers and so on”.There was some discussion as to whether they were separated by a “partition” or “a solid wall” but there was a definite ision until the gap appeared at prize-giving.It was seven to eight feet on either side of a pillar, according to one witness, and “probably the width of a person”, according to another.But did two separate rooms of people attending the dinner constitute a single event or multiple events? It’s a bit like St Patrick and the shamrock – three leaves on the one stem. St Donie and the dinner – two rooms on the one feed.Judge Fahy will have to decide.She admitted she isn’t much into golf, with the course in Ballyconneely more “the Dublin fours”.

Some say it’s the way forward,” he added.Covid officerGarbally College uses carbon-dioxide monitors and has three hepa air filters – two in special-needs classes and the other in the staffroom, because “they have the biggest congestion of people”, said Joan Madden, the school’s Covid officer since the beginning of the pandemic.Ms Madden has taken charge of ensuring that classrooms are ready and supplied with PPE, masks, sanitisers and the dispensers.Initially, stock had to be bought from a list of suppliers set by the Department of Education, which left Madden finding it “tough” to cover the school’s needs because the listed suppliers could not supply stock.“The Department of Education saw sense after a while and allowed us to buy from a local supplier. We began ordering from a local man, Tom Monaghan, in Craughwell, Co Galway, and Ocean Hygiene.“If I rang him on a Tuesday, ‘Tom, I need 1,000 masks’, I’d have them on Friday.

Photograph: iStockThe Government is likely to accept a recommendation from an independent body to shorten the working week of many public servants.Under the recommendations, additional hours for some public servants accepted in lieu of pay cuts during the economic crash – under the Haddington Road agreement – will be discontinued.However, the cost of the concession will be significantly less than the €600 million-plus the Department of Public Expenditure had warned about last year. Instead, the Government estimates that accepting the recommendations will cost about €180 million this year and €360 million in a full year.The 2013 deal increased the working week to 37 hours for those who had been working 35 hours or less up to that point. Those working more than 35 hours faced an increase of up to 39 hours.Although pay cuts introduced in the austerity era were temporary, and have since been reversed, it had been the general position of governments that parallel work practice reforms would remain in place, including additional unpaid working hours.However, on Monday it emerged that the Independent Body Examining Additional Working Hours, chaired by Kieran Mulvey, had sent recommendations to restore working hours for civil and public servants to Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath. The process was part of the most recent public sector pay agreement, the Building Momentum deal.It is understood Mr Mulvey has recommended some exceptions, including for hospital consultants, who are currently engaged in contract negotiations, and for academics. It is also expected to set a minimum working week for public servants of 35 hours a week.Health concernsThere is also some concern in government about the effect of the changes on the health service, “which would need to be carefully considered before being implemented”, according to one source.The report is unlikely to be considered by the Government for some weeks.Unions welcomed the news, which they said would finally unwind the last of the austerity measures.Noting that temporary pay cuts for more senior public servants had already been restored, Kevin Callinan, general secretary of the trade union Fórsa, said such a move on working hours would remove “a longstanding and debilitating drain on morale and productivity”.“The acceptance of the recommendation by government would also significantly enhance the prospect for continued stability in public service delivery and quality, not least by removing a huge obstacle to the successful negotiation of a public service agreement to replace Building Momentum when it expires later this year,” he said.The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation also welcomed the move, saying it would help with the retention of nurses and midwives.“The additional hours have disproportionately impacted our largely female workforce,” said general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha, who said the measure had pushed many nurses and midwives into part-time work.“Since 2013 the additional unpaid hours have had a considerable negative impact on morale, and the retention of nurses and midwives within the public health service.”"},{"url":null,"title":"zappone s special envoy role added status to ireland s un bid","story":"The analysis formed part of a review of special envoy roles that followed the controversy over the ill-fated bid to appoint Katherine Zappone to a subsequent special envoy role on freedom of expression last year. Photograph: Nick BradshawKatherine Zappone’s role as a special envoy for Ireland’s bid for a United Nations Security Council seat added “status” to the campaign which came to fruition in 2020, according to a value for money assessment of such positions.The analysis formed part of a review of special envoy roles that followed the controversy over the ill-fated bid to appoint former Independent minister Ms Zappone to a subsequent special envoy role on freedom of expression last year.There had been no open competition and the Government was forced to deny Opposition claims of cronyism.She ultimately declined the job amid the political row over her appointment.The subsequent review of special envoys found that the diplomatic jobs should be appointed in an “open, accountable and transparent manner”.The analysis of the costs of special envoys was carried out by consultancy organisation Sia Partners, whose managing partner Jane Williams was part of the review team along with senior Department of Foreign Affairs officials.A document entitled “Assessment of value for money – background notes” was released under Freedom of Information laws.It says: “In the time available a detailed cost-benefit or value for money assessment could not be carried out.”‘Outcomes and impacts’The assessment “looked at the available information on the outcomes and impacts achieved and compared these to the additional costs incurred to carry out the special envoy roles”.The document says: “It is difficult then to disaggregate the incremental impact of special envoys from the work of Irish diplomacy, save to rely on the outcome of specific goals, eg winning the Security Council seat.”It says Ireland was successful “against strong competition” in securing the votes for its appointment to the Security Council in June 2020.Twelve special envoys including then minister for children Ms Zappone and serving and retired diplomats worked on the campaign and their costs came to just over €292,000.The document says: “The special envoy role of the appointed government minister added status to this campaign.”It adds: “The qualitative evidence suggests that Ireland’s special envoys contributed to the outcome.”Other documents released show that €12,152 was spent on travel-related costs for Ms Zappone.Five retired diplomats who worked on the campaign got ex-gratia payments of €10,000 each while one - former Department of Foreign Affairs secretary general and ambassador David Cooney waived the payment. Neither the serving diplomats nor Ms Zappone got extra payments.‘Initiative spending’The value for money assessment also found that the four special envoy missions in existence during the period examined cost a combined total of just under €350,000 – or an average of €87,500 each – and that this “appears modest, in the scale of Government programme or initiative spending”.The role of former Fine Gael TD John Deasy as a special envoy to the United States Congress on the Undocumented Irish cost €55,407 in travel-related costs.The assessment looked at spending on envoy roles up to September 2021.At that point there was combined spending of just €1,205 for two of the roles: Kenneth Thompson’s appointment as special envoy to Francophone Africa and Tom Arnold as special envoy on food systems.Travel related to their work was curtailed by the Covid-19 pandemic during much of 2021, though both were able to go abroad, Mr Thompson travelling to Gabon, Burkina Faso and Niger and Mr Arnold going to Brussels.Both participated in numerous virtual meetings during 2021 and plan to undertake travel in 2022, though this will be contingent on the state of Covid-19 restrictions.Mr Arnold is to be paid a €5,000 honorarium for 2021 shortly, while Mr Thompson will be paid €25,000 for last year. Their roles are both due to expire at in December this year."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"African country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"must listen south african scientists omicron","story":"‘There are several things we don’t know about omicron,” a sombre Professor Sir Chris Whitty told the nation in the week before Christmas, “but all the things we do know are bad.”His comment puzzled many people at the time, given that scientists in South Africa, where omicron was first identified, had reported that it appeared to be less severe than the then-dominant delta variant of Covid. Surely that was good news?Three weeks on, Sir Chris’s determination to dismiss the encouraging data coming from South Africa seems even more baffling. Instead of the post-Christmas lockdown that came to be regarded almost as an inevitability, Covid rules are now being eased. The NHS did not collapse, and the number of patients requiring ventilation remains less than a quarter of the peak a year ago.Legitimate questions are now being asked about why Britain was so dismissive of the evidence from South Africa, and whether Government scientific advisers are once again using fear as a method of control.One of those who is doing the asking is Angelique Coetzee, chairman of the South African Medical Association and the first doctor to raise the alarm over a possible new variant, which turned out to be omicron.Dr Coetzee was among those who reported that omicron caused “very, very mild” symptoms compared with delta, and she hypothesised that it “could potentially be of great help to us” by replacing the more dangerous delta variant and helping the population to reach herd immunity at minimal cost to life. She says she was “astonished” at the panicked response to it in the UK.“I don’t understand why it’s happening,” she told the  from her home in Pretoria. “It doesn’t make any sense to me. The fear that has been spread in Britain – why is that being done?“South Africa has a younger population, but we should have seen far more disease than you because of the vaccination picture. We only have 44 per cent of people double-jabbed, and we only started the boosters last week.”In the UK, 83 per cent of people are double-jabbed, and 61 per cent have had a booster.“If you don’t know by now that the majority of people are going to have mild symptoms, then what other evidence are you waiting for?”It is not the first time Government scientific advisers have allegedly been dismissive of what colleagues in foreign countries have been saying.On February 21, 2020, the Italian village of Vo’ Euganeo, near Venice, went into strict quarantine after the country’s first recorded death from Covid, and almost all of its residents were tested. Around 40 per cent of those who tested positive had no symptoms, strongly suggesting asymptomatic transmission was occurring.Some members of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) say they raised concerns about asymptomatic transmission with Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Adviser, and with modeller Prof Neil Ferguson, only for their concerns to be dismissed.The two men say the warnings were not ignored, yet Boris Johnson has always insisted he would have done things differently if he had understood sooner that Covid was transmitted asymptomatically (Britain resisted lockdowns for a further month after the Italian data was published).South Africa has a highly sophisticated genomic surveillance capability for Covid – which is why both the omicron and beta variants were first identified there – so the thoughts of its scientific experts surely merit attention.Yet Boris Johnson said last month that “the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus, I think that’s something we need to set on one side”, while Sir Chris said evidence from South Africa of a milder illness had been “overinterpreted”.Does Dr Coetzee think xenophobia has played a role in Britain’s dismissal of her advice? “No – but I think there was arrogance from the politicians in the UK. Also, Boris Johnson was going through a bad time because of the criticism of his Christmas parties, so maybe there was a political reason for all this.“People in the UK, including the ones advising the Government, don’t seem to understand what the clinical picture is. The scientists are not sitting with patients in front of them. I am a GP and I’m looking at a list of 116 patients I saw, of whom only three were admitted to hospital, one of whom was not fully vaccinated and two of whom were high risk because of obesity, diabetes and so on.“You have to empower people by telling them what is going on, but I get the feeling that some of the UK scientists didn’t want to use the word ‘mild’, they only want to use the word ‘severe’.”Her suspicion appears to be borne out by the language used by the SPI-M-O modelling committee, which on December 7 said: “Currently, there is no strong evidence that omicron infections are either more or less severe than delta infections.”Laura Dodsworth, author of the book A State of Fear: How the UK Government Weaponised Fear During the Covid-19 Pandemic, says the “linguistic manipulation” was entirely deliberate.“The omission of the word ‘mild’ is not an accident,” she says. “The problem for the Government is that once you have started using fear as a tactic, there is nowhere left to go, so you have to keep on using it, and you have to keep on quoting worst case scenarios.“But each time you do it, the tactics become less successful because people become wise to it. Once you have seen the smoke and mirrors, you can’t unsee it.”Modelling published by SPI-M-O on December 15 suggested a “high-level scenario” of infections, peaking at between 600,000 and 2 million per day with the current Plan B restrictions between late December and January, with up to 6,000 deaths per day, peaking between mid-January and mid-March.In fact, infections are currently averaging around 180,000 per day and may have already peaked in some parts of the country, with deaths averaging just over 150 per day.Mark Harper MP, chairman of the anti-lockdown Covid Recovery Group, said ministers had once again been guilty of blithely following expert advice rather than interrogating advisers and looking at the picture in the round.“The whole history of the pandemic shows that ministers need to ask better questions,” he says, “challenge the advice and really get their heads around what they are being told so they can weigh it up against all the other factors they need to consider in the best interests of the country.”The most gloomy predictions for the omicron wave now seem certain to have been wide of the mark. The problem for the Government is that if a more dangerous, vaccine-resistant variant arises, it could prove difficult to persuade an increasingly cynical public to do as they’re told.More from NewsUN launches largest ever humanitarian appeal to stop Afghanistan catastrophePolitics latest news: \u0026#39Extremely unlikely\u0026#39 that Boris Johnson did not approve Downing Street party, claims former standards chiefRight-wing politician spreads anti-communism message using anchovies and beansCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortageGiant \u0026#39sea dragon\u0026#39 surfaces in the Midlands in one of Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39greatest ever\u0026#39 prehistoric findsNovak Djokovic may have won more than just a court caseMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccines pushed uk mortality rate lower start pandemic","story":"Deaths above the five-year average were considerably lower in 2021 than in the first year of the pandemic, demonstrating the huge impact of vaccines, figures suggest.Annual data from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) due to be released this week is expected to show that deaths in 2020 were 8.3 per cent above the 2015 to 2019 average, but dropped to just 2.7 per cent above the average last year – three times lower.The drop in mortality came despite huge numbers of infections at the beginning and end of 2021, suggesting that the vaccine rollout and prior immunity helped keep deaths lower than at the beginning of the pandemic.The figures also highlight a major difference in how the 2021 pandemic impacted age groups compared to 2020.Deaths in the over-65s were seven per cent lower than in 2020, and were close to the 10-year average, suggesting many older people who died in the 2021 winter wave would have died before the end of the year.However for under-65s, deaths were three per cent higher than in 2020, and 11 per cent higher than the 10-year average, suggesting younger people lost many years of life.Taken together, deaths in the two-year period of 2020-21 are expected to be about 5.5 per cent above the 2015-19 average, with experts saying that a deadlier two-year period had not been seen since the Second World War.“We tend to see falls in mortality over time and it is rare to see mortality in a year being higher than the preceding five-year average,” said Cobus Daneel, the chairman of the IFoA’s Continuous Mortality Investigation.“That happened in both 2020 and 2021, but only twice in the preceding 50 years. It is even more unusual to see a two-year period with mortality so far above the preceding five-year average. We have to go back eighty years to 1940-41 to find such an extreme period on this measure.”Although The Great Depression saw a rise in mortality of about 10 per cent in 1929, rates had dropped back by 1930, with the average of the two years only being two per cent above the prior five-year average.The figures are estimates and the final data will be crunched when the Office for National Statistics (ONS) releases final figures on Tuesday.Overall, deaths in 2021 were just one per cent higher than the 10-year average, but experts said that a drop in mortality would be expected over time, so even a small rise was worrying.Figures show that before 2020, no year has had higher mortality rates than the 10-year average since 1963.In 2021, more deaths were registered in England and Wales than in any year since the Eighties, apart from 2020.There are likely to be between 585,000 and 590,000 deaths registered in England and Wales in 2021. In contrast, 2020 was the first year since 1918 to see more than 600,000 deaths.More from NewsCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortagePolitics latest news: \u0026#39Extremely unlikely\u0026#39 that Boris Johnson did not approve Downing Street party, claims former standards chiefGiant \u0026#39sea dragon\u0026#39 surfaces in the Midlands in one of Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39greatest ever\u0026#39 prehistoric findsNovak Djokovic may have won more than just a court caseAnchovies and beans spark viral row as Korean politician whips up campaign to \u0026#39annihilate communism\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jurassic spark new generation dinosaur hunters uncovering britains","story":"It has been described as one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history: the skeleton of a 180-million-year-old ichthyosaur, discovered in Rutland Water during the routine draining of a lagoon island last February, and dug out by a team of palaeontologists in August and September.Tomorrow night (Tuesday, Jan 11), the excavation of the remains of this 10-metre “sea dragon” will feature on BBC Two’s Digging for Britain, reminding the public of what lies beneath our small island: buried treasures, the unearthing of which can yield so many secrets about our prehistory. For although the surface area of Britain is modest, our geology is erse. The opportunities to find fossils from a range of different time periods are great.Good places to look are around the rocks of Surrey, Sussex and the Isle of Wight, which date from the early Cretaceous period and were deposited 120 to 140 million years ago by rivers and on flood plains. If it weren’t for the fact these areas are covered in houses and trees – and if our climate were somewhat warmer and drier – we’d no doubt be finding as many dinosaurs here as they do in the arid American state of Utah.Yet despite our damp climate and developed land, we live in a golden age of palaeontological discovery – and also of interest in prehistory, which, of course, is linked. The UK has a long historical association with fossil-hunting and palaeontology. The first dinosaur fossils that were recognised as such were found in this country: a collection of big teeth spotted in rocks by the side of a road in Sussex in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell and her husband, Gideon. It was Richard Owen, a British scientist, who later coined the term “dinosauria”, meaning “terrible lizards”. The teeth were the first evidence of a dinosaur known as Iguanodon.There followed a 19th-century fossil-hunting craze in Britain among Victorian gentlemen naturalists. Its legacy is found in the Natural History Museum, where we have today a large dinosaur collection from countries including Canada and from southern Africa.Until the start of the Second World War, dinosaurs fascinated the British. Our interest seems to have waned after that, until the mid-1990s, when our interest in these primal and often terrifying beasts was reignited. I was 13 when Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster Jurassic Park was released in 1993. Although I knew I wanted to work with dinosaurs, my interest in the subject would have been regarded as niche for a girl in her early teens. The film made it more socially acceptable and mainstream. It made me less weird among my secondary school peers.Now that the Jurassic Park generation has come of age, we are seeing the results of those childhood passions in our universities. During the 15 years that I have worked in the field, there has been an explosion in academic study of vertebrate palaeontology. Several universities now offer undergraduate degrees in the subject, including the universities of Portsmouth, Bristol and Birmingham. While geology courses more often used to cater to students interested in entering, say, the oil or mining industries, today’s geology undergraduates are more interested in bioersity.Yet as in the case of the Rutland sea dragon, whose remains were found by Joe Davis, an employee of the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust, many palaeontological finds are opportunistic – that is, not made by professionals. The UK today has a large community of amateur fossil-hunters, who are out there looking for fossils, sometimes on a daily basis. They visit the brick pits around Peterborough, or the cliffs of the Isle of Wight, particularly in winter when the storms roll in and the rocks become unstable and can collapse.There are no special techniques to fossil-finding. We just have to use an ancient tool: our eyes. But we have to know where to look.So what has this golden age of palaeontological discovery actually yielded? Quite a lot, really. Last year saw not only the unearthing of the Rutland sea dragon, but also a huge Jurassic seabed in a Cotswolds quarry, where colleagues have discovered a beautifully preserved haul of fossil sea urchins, starfish, sea lilies and feather stars.The remains of two dinosaurs that lived about 125 million years ago and were found on the Isle of Wight were identified in September and named Ceratosuchops inferodios – or “horned crocodile-faced hell heron” – and Riparovenator milnerae, a predator with a skull more than 3ft in length.Then in October, we identified Britain’s earliest known carnivorous dinosaur. Named Pendraig milnerae and roughly the size of a chicken, this creature had been found in Carmarthenshire in Wales in the 1950s and entered our collection in the 1960s. But it wasn’t until last year that, after comparison with better known specimens from around the world, we discovered it was new and deserved to be recognised as a type of dinosaur in its own right.In November, other fossils found on the Isle of Wight were identified as another new species, called Brighstoneus simmondsi. The defining characteristic of this eight-metre long herbivore was its bulbous nose.Behind the Isle of Wight finds was a retired GP called Jeremy Lockwood, who has spent much of the pandemic hunting for fossils on the beach and is studying part-time for a PhD at the University of Portsmouth and the Natural History Museum. He may not be the only one who has spent these past two years in fruitful palaeontological employ. With a boom in “staycations” – including on the Jurassic coast of southern England – it’s possible there has been something of a pandemic boom in dinosaur hunting. And, from our point of view, the more eyes on the ground the better. The more discoveries by amateurs this heightened interest turns up, the more detailed a picture we can build of our prehistory.So far we have barely scratched the surface. From the start of the Jurassic period to the end of the Cretaceous is a time of 140 million years. During this, everything that lived on land and was larger than a metre in size was a dinosaur. So that is 140 million years of animals evolving, dying and going extinct. Most of their remains will not have become fossils. Many of those that did are yet to be discovered, as vast portions of the world remain very little studied. In Africa, South America and parts of central Asia, prehistory is underexplored and there remain huge geographic areas where we don’t really know what was living there. Our existing knowledge only covers a fraction of a per cent of what once roamed our planet, and of what is still on it, sitting beneath the surface waiting to be found. With every new discovery, we feel a thrill of excitement – and, each time it happens, we learn a little more.Dr Susannah Maidment is a principal researcher in Earth Sciences at the Natural History Museum.

Rumours are flying that Jeremy Corbyn, still deprived of the Labour whip at Westminster and therefore unable to submit himself as an official candidate ahead of the next general election, is about to launch a new party.Naturally this is being seen as dreadful news for Corbyn’s successor as Labour leader, Keir Starmer: splits, which are far more common on the British Left than on the Right, tend to presage a significant electoral defeat for the party. See 1983 and 2019.There’s no escaping the fact that a new party emerging from Corbyn’s recently launched Peace and Justice Project would pose some organisational and presentational difficulties for Starmer. But there is far more to be gained from such a split, and those who want to see a Labour government in our lifetime should keep their fingers crossed that the rumour mill, on this occasion, is accurate.The root of Corbyn’s grievance is obvious: any MP deprived of the party whip cannot be considered by his or her local party as an official candidate. Naturally, Starmer wants rid of Corbyn from the Parliamentary Labour Party, but that simply wasn’t going to happen if he trusted the judgment of local members in Islington North. Pressing the nuclear button of expulsion would provoke a massive backlash, so deprivation of the whip until after the next general election is an effective, unchallengeable tactic that will serve Starmer’s ends.It\u0027s rumoured that the former Labour MP Mary Creagh, who famously confronted Corbyn for his performance as leader after she lost her Wakefield seat at the 2019 election, is now rumoured to be the leadership’s preferred candidate to replace Corbyn in Islington North – a move that is 100 per cent guaranteed to infuriate Corbyn’s supporters across the country.The hard Left, of which Corbyn remains the figurehead, have been itching for an opportunity to throw a punch at Starmer and the Labour Party and there are many who would relish the prospect of Corbyn standing as an independent against the official Labour candidate — a contest Corbyn would be likely to win.But even this scenario has more upsides than downsides for Starmer. He needs to show that he is in charge of the party and that his promise of a zero tolerance approach to anti-Semitism is being honoured. Corbyn, whose ill-judged comments about the inquiry into anti-Semitism in Labour by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) led directly to his suspension, remains an embarrassment to Labour so long as he sits in Parliament. If he is there as an independent with his own mandate, Starmer can legitimately disown all responsibility for his presence.And there are plenty in Labour who would welcome the setting up of an entirely new party committed to the kind of anti-West, hard Left economic policies that Corbyn has stood for throughout his career — some because they might be interested in signing up, but many more because they would finally be rid of shouty activists who seem to have more in common with the Socialist Workers’ Party than with a moderate Labour Party committed to change through the democratic and parliamentary process.Such a split should, by rights, have happened long before now there is precious little common ground between centrist Labour and Corbyn’s hard Left, other than a loathing of the common enemy. They disagree fundamentally on defence, on the economy and on foreign policy, especially with regard to Israel and the Middle East. A orce would allow each side to live more happily apart. The reason such a split has never happened is nothing to do with loyalty to the Labour brand or an affection for its history and legacy it is because the current electoral system is guaranteed to kill any splinter group, either immediately or within a very few years. It’s why so many on the hard Left are advocates of electoral reform, which they hope would guarantee at least some representation for a committed Marxist faction. Introducing the single transferable vote would, moreover, have the added attraction of relieving the main party of the need to reform its policies in order to win new voters. Post-polling day alliances could be formed — even between Labour and its former comrades — that would both veto any future Conservative government while allowing unreconstructed socialists to get into government.That’s the theory anyway. That any new Corbyn-led party might be launched before electoral reform is secured says a lot about how desperate the hard Left is. They have never been short of belief in their own philosophy and a conviction that the electorate would embrace them if only they weren’t so stupid and greedy. Like the SDP in 1981, perhaps they believe they can break the mould of British politics with a display of chutzpah and razzamatazz and a decent showing in the odd by-election.Until a split happens (and sadly, it may not), Starmer will continue to feel he is somehow in thrall to his own Left wing, convinced he must continue to throw the occasional morsel to those who once voted for Corbyn but who, perhaps reluctantly, supported his leadership bid in 2020. But imagine a world where a significant number of those party members threw their lot in with the People’s Movement for Peace, Justice and Kindness (trademark pending), where Starmer no longer had to put up with internal criticism every time he praised the record of the last Labour government or supported Sir Tony Blair’s knighthood. What new, innovative policies could Labour develop once it was free from the tyranny of having to sate the socialist appetite of those who can never be satisfied?Imagine having the freedom to campaign for a Labour government without having to worry about those who believe that any Labour Party that is popular with the British people is, by definition, a Labour Party that has sold out.Starmer and his team should adopt a poker faced approach to the prospect of a Corbyn split. In public they should say all the right things — regret, what a shame, best of luck, etc — and confine their glee to private occasions. The new party that would be born from Corbyn’s defection would not be his own it would be the Labour Party.More from NewsRight-wing politician spreads anti-communism message using anchovies and beansCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortagePolitics latest news: \u0026#39Extremely unlikely\u0026#39 that Boris Johnson did not approve Downing Street party, claims former standards chiefGiant \u0026#39sea dragon\u0026#39 surfaces in the Midlands in one of Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39greatest ever\u0026#39 prehistoric findsNovak Djokovic may have won more than just a court caseMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"labours plan devolution exactly britain doesnt need","story":"Sir Keir Starmer has recently been on a mission to persuade the voters that, unlike his predecessor, he actually quite likes the United Kingdom. The Union Jack has started cropping up in his videos. Harmless if insubstantial bromides about his pride in this country have appeared in his speeches. All basic, but nonetheless important: there are few things Labour politicians can do to make life easy for the Conservatives than allowing them to turn Is Britain a good thing? into a wedge issue.But the tough bit as ever is following up word with deed. And when it comes to policy, alas, it looks as if Starmer doesn’t actually think very much of this country at all.How else to explain the fact that he seems to be getting ready to endorse Gordon Brown’s proposals for devo-max?If you’re unfamiliar with the term, it involves devolving the maximum powers you possibly can to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland whilst maintaining the technical existence of the UK. According to media reports, the former Prime Minister plans to limit the role of the British Government to areas such as “foreign affairs and defence” pretty much everything else gets included in “further sweeping powers to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland”.Which raises an obvious challenge to Starmer’s patriotic protestations: if you think this country is such a good thing, why do you want to remove it so completely from the day-to-day lives of its citizens?Even on a tactical level, the logic is abysmal. Labour’s decades-long effort to triangulate its way past the SNP has yielded nothing but retreat and defeat. And by meeting every Nationalist success with promises to further hollow out the British state, the Opposition has wound up asking voters to reject the separatists’ conclusions whilst accepting their most fundamental and dangerous premises.To the surprise of nobody but Labour, this attempt to muddle through hasn’t worked. The Party now offers an unconvincing spectacle to voters on either side of Scotland’s constitutional ide – and by flirting with major concessions remains wide open in England to the Tory charge of selling the national silver to the SNP.But the problems with ‘devo-max’ go well beyond tactics. It strikes to the heart of a much more fundamental strategic question, which is that it is increasingly difficult to make the case for a Union that doesn’t do anything.Imagine a future referendum on Scottish independence, sometime after Labour have enacted these reforms. A pro-UK activist knocks on a door, and the voter presses them on what being part of the UK means for the issues that really matter to them.The NHS? “Oh, that’s devolved.” What about the under-performing schools? “Sorry, devolved too.” Well, at least there’s that ‘pooling and sharing’ they’ve heard so much about? “Well actually, since we devolved so many tax powers there are far fewer fiscal transfers these days.”We’re not living through the Cold War anymore most voters are not greatly exercised by foreign affairs and defence. Brown’s plan involves stripping out more and more positive reasons for anyone to vote for the UK, leaving in place only a negative one: “But it does so little, why bother to leave?”Britain needs, and deserves, a left-wing party that believes in it, and recognises the hugely valuable role it has to play in making sure every British citizen can access the services and opportunities they deserve. Instead Labour, incapable of admitting fault or subjecting its own politicians to critical scrutiny, seems condemned to keep having its one idea over and over again and hoping that this time, somehow, it will produce a different result. More from NewsPolitics latest news: \u0026#39Extremely unlikely\u0026#39 that Boris Johnson did not approve Downing Street party, claims former standards chiefRight-wing politician spreads anti-communism message using anchovies and beansCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortageGiant \u0026#39sea dragon\u0026#39 surfaces in the Midlands in one of Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39greatest ever\u0026#39 prehistoric findsNovak Djokovic may have won more than just a court caseMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"monday evening uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Housing reform | What a day it’s been for Michael Gove, the Housing Secretary, who set out how money for fixing dangerous cladding must come from those responsible and confirmed immediate amendments to the Building Safety Bill to extend leaseholders\u0027 rights.

In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, interest rates were slashed from 5.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent and we have become addicted to cheap money policies ever since — impacting peoples’ attitude towards saving and borrowing. In particular, a generation of younger people have spent their entire adult lives with interest rates at rock bottom.Due to the imminent cost of living crisis, there is now a recognition that the Bank of England was asleep at the wheel last year and did not act early enough to curb inflationary pressures. Although it raised rates in December from 0.1 per cent to 0.25 per cent, they are still low. This poses a challenge to financial stability. Low rates mean financial markets do not price properly for risk, encouraging speculative behaviour. This last happened ahead of the global financial crisis. Equally, because of quantitative easing, the Bank of England is now the biggest holder of government debt, which has artificially inflated bond prices and kept longer-term borrowing yields low. We used to believe that such low yields would boost investment. Now they seem to encourage firms to load their balance sheets with debt.Perhaps the biggest concern, though, is that the culture of low rates has exacerbated inequality. They have fed rampant asset price inflation. This is not just of stocks and bonds, but also of house prices. While there are other factors at play, cheap finance has been a key driver. Even though mortgage rates are low, buyers have had to take on more borrowing, burdening themselves with debt. This has fed imbalances between home-owners and renters, between the asset rich and asset poor. Pensioners who rely on bank deposits have suffered, but it is the young who are impacted most.Younger people increasingly can’t move from Generation Rent to Generation Buy, which is part of a broader challenge they have in seeing themselves as being able to amass capital. Assets that should be attainable are too far away for too many. One might be tempted to say we are moving from a property-owning democracy to an always-borrowing democracy. Of course, higher wages are part of the challenge, not just low interest rates.Unfortunately, some may only have access to loan sharks or pay day loans — but even among the wider population of younger people, the interest rates charged on student debt are much higher than they really should be.All this is helping to feed a shift in attitudes towards borrowing among millennials. Buy now and pay later is increasingly seen as more viable, in part because low rates mean this is not seen as debt but instead as a more convenient and sensible way to pay. Before credit controls were relaxed in the 1980s, this was viewed as borrowing on the “never-never” — where only part of the cost was paid immediately and the rest over time, but often then at high borrowing rates. Then people did it because they had no other options more interesting is that it is now made by choice, because rates are low.Although interest rates look set to rise this year, they will still be low by historic standards. Many of these challenges look set to persist long into the future.More from NewsCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortagePolitics latest news: \u0026#39Extremely unlikely\u0026#39 that Boris Johnson did not approve Downing Street party, claims former standards chiefGiant \u0026#39sea dragon\u0026#39 surfaces in the Midlands in one of Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39greatest ever\u0026#39 prehistoric findsNovak Djokovic may have won more than just a court caseAnchovies and beans spark viral row as Korean politician whips up campaign to \u0026#39annihilate communism\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"living virus means living unvaccinated","story":"No one much likes Novak Djokovic. Even when he wins, he loses, with crowds loudly willing his opponent on. His astonishing resilience on court is dismissed as robotic, his superhuman fitness a form of sneering at more frail, fallible mortals.That public antipathy may initially have blinded the world to the grotesque treatment he endured in Australia. One thing is certain, it would never have happened to Roger Federer. But there is something deeply chilling about the sight of a man deemed a political threat, on his own, being spirited away by the heavies at an airport. It is the kind of thing that happens to Alexei Navalny flying into Moscow, not the world No 1 tennis player arriving to defend his title in a liberal democracy.Yet his youth and fitness are a reminder of why some vaccine strategies have gone off the rails, not just in Australia, but in Europe too. For the evidence suggests that whether it is a young tennis player, or young drinkers out trying to enjoy themselves, the wrong people are being targeted by harsh vaccine restrictions around the world.Djokovic challenges a draconian Covid strategy down under that has governed life for countless months. It is, as Dominic Wilkinson, professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford, points out, a strategy founded in the nation’s isolation, which has allowed it to pretend it can cut itself off from the pandemic. But as Wilkinson, himself half-English and half-Australian, also notes: “The difficulty was always going to be in sustaining that.”Like every other government, the Australian authorities are weighing up how to get back to normal life. Given we cannot eliminate the disease, the path to attaining this, says Wilkinson, is obvious: ensure enough people have enough immunity to prevent Covid posing a serious threat. “The question is how do you get from here to there?” The answer is building populations’ resistance through either vaccination or “natural immunity” – catching Covid and fighting it off. Or both. Djokovic argues that, having recently recovered from Covid, he benefits from natural immunity. But in a country where Covid has until recently been rare, and which has still recorded less than a million cases, compared to 14.5 million in the UK, natural immunity is dismissed. Vaccination is king.Even in the UK, where so many of us have caught the disease, this “natural immunity” defence is still officially considered suspect. Hence the Health Secretary Sajid Javid’s shock on being told last week by Steve James, an ICU consultant at Kings College Hospital, that James had not yet been vaccinated and did not want to be, because “the science is not strong enough”.It is easy to protest, as Dr Peter English, a former consultant in communicable disease control, did yesterday, that healthcare workers refusing vaccines are “irresponsible” because they risk both transmitting the disease to vulnerable patients and, potentially, falling ill and taking up an NHS bed themselves.Yet, on the risk of infection, as Dr Julian Tang, clinical virologist, respiratory sciences, at the University of Leicester, has pointed out, “natural infection with viruses generally provides longer lasting and broader immune protection, compared to vaccination”.And, on transmission, Javid’s own Department of Health has just released a study showing that while vaccines cut transmission for the original Covid strain, new strains see both vaccinated and unvaccinated people transmitting the virus at similar rates.This is, as Wilkinson is at pains to point out, not to suggest that immunity acquired from catching Covid is somehow preferable to getting a jab. The dangers of contracting Covid are far greater than any potential vaccine side effects. “I think there are strong reasons to have a vaccine for health professionals,” he says. “The question is whether it’s ethically justified to force people to have a vaccine if they have had a confirmed infection… because there is reasonable evidence that those who have had the vaccine and those who have had an infection have similar protection from infection and risk of passing on the virus.”Across the Atlantic, there are similar doubts. “If you listen to the language of our public health officials, they talk about the vaccinated and the unvaccinated,” Marty Makary, professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University told the British Medical Journal last autumn, in an article reviewing a host of studies that described similar protection from vaccine and infection-led immunity. “If we want to be scientific, we should talk about the immune and the non-immune.”It is a distinction certain to become ever more stark, ever more fraught, because of the increasing use of vaccine mandates around the world by governments, schools and employers – Italy is even banning the unvaccinated from ski lifts. Ignoring infection history also throws broader government vaccination policy, beyond vaccine mandates, into doubt, in the UK as much as in Australia.Here, young people have been targeted with measures requiring them to show proof of vaccination to enter nightclubs. As many in the industry predicted, it appears to be having little effect. Latest ONS figures show the highest rates of infection among young adults. Indeed, a year into the vaccination campaign, it is beginning to become clear who is most in need of jabs and boosters. And the answer is the same as at the start of the pandemic. Then policy was framed as if the virus did not discriminate. It soon became clear this was not true. The elderly and those with co-morbidities were very much more at risk. The same people, it seems clear, should be the focus of vaccination campaigns.Indeed, demonising the unvaccinated, notably the young and fit, is almost certainly counter-productive. In the first six months of last year, 67 per cent of the population received at least their first jab. Since then, however, only another 10 per cent have come forward, leaving almost a quarter entirely unjabbed. Discounting children under 12, not yet eligible for a vaccine, that leaves up to six million Britons unjabbed. Many are teenagers and young adults, up to a third of whom are not fully vaccinated.But in some areas, particularly in London, over a quarter of over-60s are not double jabbed. Ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately. In the latest ONS figures, the lowest third-dose and booster vaccination coverage was among Pakistani (42.2 per cent), black Caribbean (44.4 per cent) and black African (45.4 per cent) ethnic groups. Almost all white people aged 80 and above are fully jabbed, while only four out of five black people over 80 are, which a government report last month blamed for higher death rates among minorities.These are the groups that would most benefit from the protection of vaccines. Yet coercion is unlikely to change their minds. Indeed, it is a blunt tool. In the latest ONS survey, fewer than two in 10 of those hesitant to have a vaccine said needing one to work or go on holiday might make them change their mind. The most persuasive reason, for the slim minority willing to countenance it, was altruism – to protect others.These millions are not anti-vaxxers – militant, headline-hogging campaigners calling doctors and nurses administering jabs murderers. But they are damned by association, making many even more reluctant to come forward now. Some GPs, like Dr Azhar Farooqi, in Leicester, have realised a less confrontational approach is required. Having noticed that many of his highest-risk patients, particularly from poorer or ethnic minority backgrounds, were turning down the jab, he telephoned them personally for a reassuring chat. On the spot, 70 per cent changed their minds.It is the very opposite of the French president Emmanuel Macron’s decision to “p––– off” the unvaccinated, making it increasingly hard for them to live without it. Indeed, insisting people take vaccines to protect themselves is not just of questionable effectiveness, it is also morally wrong, says Wilkinson. “It’s a bad ethical reason, it’s a paternalistic reason, it says government knows better than you what to do with your own health.”More from NewsUN launches largest ever humanitarian appeal to stop Afghanistan catastrophePolitics latest news: \u0026#39Extremely unlikely\u0026#39 that Boris Johnson did not approve Downing Street party, claims former standards chiefRight-wing politician spreads anti-communism message using anchovies and beansCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortageGiant \u0026#39sea dragon\u0026#39 surfaces in the Midlands in one of Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39greatest ever\u0026#39 prehistoric findsNovak Djokovic may have won more than just a court caseMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"roman dual carriageway market town unearthed hs2 dig","story":"A Roman “dual carriageway” has been unearthed by archaeologists along with the remains of an ancient British boom town.Excavation work for HS2 has uncovered the remains of a 26-acre settlement near Chipping Warden in Northamptonshire, which reveals signs of entrepreneurial town planning in Britain more than 1,700 years ago.Archaeologists have discovered a “dual carriageway” twice the side of an ordinary Roman road running through the site, likely laid to ease congestion for merchants and their carts cramming into what was a thriving trading town.Its oversized infrastructure shows the commercial importance of the site, which enjoyed a boom in the third century AD, experts have said, and finery from across the Roman Empire poured into the town before it went bust with the end of Roman rule.“We think the reason for that is to allow two streams of traffic to pass through this area. This would have been a very busy area at that time, and you can imagine people loading and unloading goods when they arrived here.”Jim McKeon, the Museum of London Archaeology project manager at the site, said building the road showed “clever town planning” by locals who exploited the settlement’s position near the River Cherwell and the Fosse Way Roman road.The well-connected town likely shipped livestock and agricultural goods towards London, and its newfound wealth from the third century is revealed by the luxuries coming the other way, including glass vessels, jewellery, and high-status pottery from Gaul.Hundreds of Roman coins have also been found by the 70 archaeologists working at the site, along with chemical compounds used to make ancient make-up, and ornate scale weights for weighing merchants’ wares.Shackles have also been found at the site, which may indicate slaves were traded in the area.The town plan, which helped the local economy, also segregated the settlement and archaeologists have found what they have termed a Roman “B-road”, leading traffic away from the residential area to the equivalent of an “industrial estate”.Mr McKeon said: “It has been well thought out. Just like today, you don’t want the smelly, heavy industry near where you live.”Excavations have found evidence of large fires, indicating the area may have been used to bake large quantities of bread, or as a foundry or pottery kiln. Experts have also unearthed evidence of a holding area for livestock.Both working areas are set apart from larger residences in the settlement, which may have been several stories, and indicate the newfound wealth of locals.Whilst the town appears to have enjoyed a boom period under Roman rule, estimated to have lasted from about 250AD to 350AD, the settlement appears to have suffered an economic bust following the end of Roman rule in the early fifth century.Mr McKeon said: “Once the Empire begins to recede, those trade links with Europe begin to disappear. There just aren’t the same opportunities.”Archaeological evidence suggests that the site went quickly out of use following this economic collapse, as the local population returned to the subsistence agriculture that predominated in the area before Roman rule.Mr McKeon believes that the site’s 10 metre-wide road may have been quickly covered and lost during this period, saying: “Just like today, if today you left a motorway unused, it wouldn’t take long before it would become covered by soil and vegetation.”The hidden road, made up of several layers of stone arranged in different sizes, would also have made the area impossible to plough for later farmers, and as a result the site has remained well-preservedThe Museum of London Archaeology team working along the HS2 rail line has found evidence of 30 Iron Age roundhouses and a road from the period before Romanisation and the village becoming a prominent trading hub. So far, only uncovered above five acres of the settlement, which geophysical surveys suggest could be 26 acres in size.More from NewsRight-wing politician spreads anti-communism message using anchovies and beansCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortagePolitics latest news: \u0026#39Extremely unlikely\u0026#39 that Boris Johnson did not approve Downing Street party, claims former standards chiefGiant \u0026#39sea dragon\u0026#39 surfaces in the Midlands in one of Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39greatest ever\u0026#39 prehistoric findsNovak Djokovic may have won more than just a court caseMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"three weeks tumultuous life covid","story":"It is a difficult thing for a journalist to do, but let me try to think back three weeks.

A hundred Conservative MPs had rebelled against his reimposition of some restrictions because of the omicron variant.

Even NHS chiefs, usually Eeyores, admit that it is not being overwhelmed. Ministers suggest that further restrictions are unlikely to be needed. Fresh revelations about No10 parties might revive the Boris on the brink headlines, but with rather less conviction. The explanation for these comical changes of political fortune is Covid-19 itself. Whenever people feel a setback in recovery, they turn against the Prime Minister. Whenever they feel renewed hope, they feel all right about him. It is pretty much as simple as that.Few seem to learn the lesson, which is that the disease is a classic example of Kipling’s famous test of “If you can meet with triumph and disaster And treat those two impostors just the same”. Anyone who has proclaimed social collapse and bubonic plague-like mortality has been proved wrong. So has anyone who has announced we have “licked the virus”.The most one can tentatively say about Boris’s handling of it all is that it went fairly badly at first and then went better after the vaccine. Britain has been neither disgraced nor exalted in the eyes of the world as a result. The Prime Minister deserves neither a speeded-up Knighthood of the Garter nor a P45.Only when the illness does more or less go quiet will people form a settled judgment. Then they will weigh the costs, of all kinds. Perhaps the test example will be energy prices. Will their enormous rises be excused on the grounds that the explosion in demand – and therefore price – is essentially a temporary Covid by-product? Or will voters question the underlying, much longer-term upward trend caused by the delusion that we face a “climate emergency” so severe that no cost incurred trying to prevent it is too great?On which last point, it might clarify minds if the Government could state baldly its policy on gas: it is that we must, at almost any cost, import it rather than produce it.Faced with the awkward fact that the intermittency of renewables absolutely requires fossil fuel back-up for the accurately foreseeable future, the Government tacitly recognises the need. Like the Pharisees in the Gospel, however, it worries more about taint to its own purity than doing what is actually good. So it cannot bear to give permission for fracking or assist more North Sea gas production, but does not mind being dependent on expensive supplies from foreign powers, some of which will exploit their power over us for hostile political ends.Their gas production, of course, will add more carbon dioxide to the planet, but “off the books” as far as Britain is concerned. Britain’s “consumption-based” emissions are much higher than our “production-based” ones and the gap between the two has been growing. This may be good for President Putin, but does nothing for the planet and nothing but harm to the British consumer’s pocket.Going through an old photograph album, I found a picture I had taken on my first visit to India, 40 years ago. It was of a plaque erected by the Indian government beside the British memorial in Delhi to those British and Indians (roughly 1,250) killed by the rebels in the Indian Mutiny of 1857. It reads: “The ‘enemy’ of the inscriptions on this monument were those who rose against colonial rule and fought bravely for national liberation.” The “heroism of these immortal martyrs” was thus commemorated on the 25th anniversary of Indian independence in 1972, it adds.In the light of recent events, I was interested by this early example of “retain and explain”. The words are quite fierce, but they are pinned on an adjoining wall rather than obscuring the original monument. Nothing is toppled or defaced. How much more dignified than that little mob in Bristol.Last week’s item about Desmond Tutu’s time as a curate in England has produced several charming responses from readers.One is a letter from “D M Tutu”, which appeared in Cranleigh parish magazine after he and his family had spent a month in a borrowed house in Horsham Road in that Surrey village in 1963: “We take back with us only the happiest of memories – of strangers stopping to give us a cheery ‘Hello’: of an old lady crossing the road to shake us by the hand to welcome us to her village: of transport generously put at our disposal: of friendly and helpful shopkeepers, who were not trying all the time to palm off dubious goods on unsuspecting visitors – I could go on, multiplying examples of your warm friendliness.”Another is a further example of Tutu’s amusement about skin colour differences: he loved it when someone unthinkingly described him as “tickled pink”.More from NewsUN launches largest ever humanitarian appeal to stop Afghanistan catastrophePolitics latest news: \u0026#39Extremely unlikely\u0026#39 that Boris Johnson did not approve Downing Street party, claims former standards chiefRight-wing politician spreads anti-communism message using anchovies and beansCovid latest news: School leaders back five-day isolation as classes of 120 children cram into halls amid teacher shortageGiant \u0026#39sea dragon\u0026#39 surfaces in the Midlands in one of Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39greatest ever\u0026#39 prehistoric findsNovak Djokovic may have won more than just a court caseMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"four ways make your christmas","story":"Four ways to make your Christmas with loved ones safer according to GPWe can still have a great time together – just follow these tips to help protect loved ones from the new Covid- strainthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-numbers-uk-records--,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:ceaefcdbe,sourceUrl:Copied from RSC,site:Mirror,brandSafety: General news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:dtzrPE,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Close contact with others – especially in unventilated spaces – increases your chances of spreading Covid-. If you’re spending the festive season with loved ones there are lots of ways you can reduce the risk, including taking regular rapid lateral flow tests, letting fresh air in and getting your booster. GP Dr Claire Ashley provides some simple tips for staying safe so you and those close to you can gather round the table and enjoy your Christmas fun. Take those tests  Meeting up with loved ones  You should all do a rapid lateral flow test before you mingle.They’re free, easy to do at home and the results show in half an hour – to order a pack, go to nhs.uk get-tested.“If you haven’t got any symptoms, rapid lateral flow tests are very good at picking up Covid-,” says Dr Ashley, based in the South West. “On Christmas morning, before granny comes over for lunch, taking a test is the best way to check you’re not infectious. “My family will all have a rapid lateral flow test the morning we travel down to see my parents, andanything comes back positive, or any of us has symptoms, we won’t go. “I’m aware our plans might be disrupted. It’s not perfect, especially after last year, but I’d rather everyone stays safe.”  As Dr Ashley points out, rapid lateral flow tests are designed to pick up Covid- cases with no symptoms, soyou do have symptoms such as a fever, cough or loss of sense of taste or smell, you need to isolate immediately and take a PCR test. Andyour rapid lateral flow test does show a positive result, you’ll need to isolate and only leave the house to take a PCR test to confirm it.If you have been in contact with someone with Covid- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. If you test positive or develop symptoms in those seven days, you must self-isolate, take a PCR test and follow the guidance on gov.uk.If you are unvaccinated, you must self-isolate for  daysyou are in contact with someone who has Covid-.Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive, so keep it on.Open the window sLetting fresh air into your home is one way to help reduce the spread of Covid-. Opening windows and doors for just  minutes will help. “Covid- is an airborne virus and the research suggests that when you’re in a well-ventilated space the risk of contracting it is reduced,” says Dr Ashley. “That’s why being outdoors is much more safe, but that’s tricky when it’s very cold. Soyou want to reduce the chances of Covid- being passed on, have the windows open so you get as much airflow as possible.” Wear a face covering You must wear a face covering in public areas such as shops, places of worship, entertainment venues, and on public transport. It’s wise to wear a mask in crowded or enclosed spaces, eventhey’re not legally required. “Face coverings are really effective at reducing how much you’re spreading Covid-,” explains Dr Ashley. Get your booster Every adult in the country now needs to get a Covid- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Book yours now at nhs.uk covidvaccination.Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent than ever before with Covid- because Omicron is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a Covid- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.If you haven’t had your first or second vaccine, go to nhs.uk covidvaccination or call  to book it, or find your nearest walk-in centre.“It’s also very important for pregnant women to get vaccinated,” adds Dr Ashley. “The benefits of being vaccinated and boosted really outweigh the risks.”People with lower immune systems might need to be more careful about socialising this Christmas, as they could have less protection against getting severely ill with Covid-. This includes people who are taking medication that suppresses the immune system – eg, for rheumatoid arthritis – and those having chemotherapy.

Pepe Di’Iasio’s school in Yorkshire has more than  leaks in the roof, leaving his pupils “cold and wet”. As we launch Levelling up Watch, Mr Di’Iasio said: “Words are cheap, actions speak louder than words.”Mr Di’Iasio dreads the rain. Dreads it because the school roof leaks and staff will be running around classrooms to place buckets to catch the water. It’s just one more problem in a Covid-hit educational world that has caused such anxiety for his pupils that some have turned up drunk for lessons, while others have been traumatised by domestic violence. The school has used all its cash reserves putting support in place. Di’Iasio says: “We’ve done our best to try to prioritise people, not spend money on bricks and mortar.” But the -year-old building is in desperate need of investment.  The clapped-out drains are collapsing, there are cracks in windows caused by subsidence, water comes through the flat roof in at least  places, and the technology building has been closed because it is in such a state. Site manager Martin Smith gives us a tour of Wales High School near Sheffield, South Yorks, and says: “It’s just a nightmare, we’re forever mopping up.” We stop to chat to two caretakers, one has  keys hanging on a chain around his neck as the locks have not been upgraded since the school opened in . The caretakers are fixing a huge fan heater and, with a sigh, one explains: “It’s broken again. Everything is just tired out.”  There are , pupils, aged  to , at the school, where carpets are stained from the leaks and ceiling tiles are missing where caretakers burst them to release the build-up of water. Science teachers were furious last term when water came through and destroyed crucial coursework. But despite the struggles, Mr Di’Iasio and the caretakers could not be more proud of their secondary school and their “amazing” pupils. The devotion of the staff is clear – during lockdown, the kitchen staff and cleaners repainted the whole school. It may not be pretty, but Wales High School, rated “Good” by Ofsted, is so popular parents fight to get their kids places, with at least  appeals every year when admission is refused.  The school tries to keep up with this demand, even converting staff toilets to classrooms. Head of School, Lisa McCall lost half her office to accommodate students. She says: “I can hear the lesson next door and I have to whisperdiscussing anything confidential because of the thin partition.” Mr Di’Iasio invited the Mirror into the school to show how desperately funding is needed. He has seen no sign of the promised levelling up or extra money for schools. He says: “It’s hard to believe we are in the world’s sixth-largest economy. Levelling up is supposed to be the big idea of Boris Johnson’s government.When he was elected in  he pledged to spread opportunity to every corner of the UK. But two years later we are still waiting for the Prime Minister to deliver on his promises. A White Paper setting out the Government’s plan was supposed to have been published this month but has now been shelved until the new year.Many are starting to question whether Mr Johnson is genuinely committed to spreading wealth and opportunity orlevelling up is just an empty slogan. That is why the Mirror is today launching Levelling Up Watch. We intend to hold the Government to account over its plans to improve schools, communities, education and transport. We also want to see any additional money distributed fairly and not just to seats the Tories need to retain to stay in power. What is clear is tinkering with the structure of local government and sprinkling money on piecemeal transport schemes will not be enough. The regional inequality in Britain is not only deep and engrained, it has become starker since the Conservatives came to power in . During that period more than , Sure Start Centres have closed, local councils have seen their funding cut by more than % and the budgets for public health and education have been badly squeezed. The National Audit Office found that since , funding in the most deprived fth of schools fell in real terms by .%, while funding in the fth least deprived schools rose by .%. The additional money announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in his Budget will onlyper pupil funding to  levels. People in poorer areas are likely to have worse health and shorter le expectancy but the budget for Public Health England in - is % – £billion – lower in real terms than in -. Nor can it be right that - transport spending was £ per capita in London, compared to £ in the North East and £ in Yorkshire and Humber. We have heard plenty of words from Mr Johnson about his ambitions to level up but the time for rhetoric is over. We need to see some action.  “We are in a s building and as we speak the rain is pouring down. “I have no doubt that we will have more than five or six dferent leaks, with buckets in classrooms, by the end of the day. We are in a school where children will be cold and wet. “This at a time when we are keeping windows open to allow airflow to prevent the spread of Covid, and the heating is working overtime to keep the temperature at a level you can work and learn in. “Our site staff are brilliant at trying to make do and mend, but the building is creaking and when it rains the flat roof leaks. It has been patched up as much as it possibly can be. “The building is not really fit for purpose and the environment can have a massive impact on learning.”  Mr Di‘Iasio is also dealing with the impact of Covid on his pupils’ mental health. He says: “We are dealing with the fallout from that from a large number of students on a daily basis. “Initially when the students came back they were just so happy to be back, but then things changed and they started exhibiting more extremes of behaviour than we had before. “We had students turning up with alcohol, being under the influence. “We had students who had the police in the house overnight dealing with incidents of domestic violence and we’ve had incidents where students have been suffering from the pressure of the exam process.  “We have spent our money making sure we keep our staff and have enough people to support the students. “There is more money now invested in mental health support and wellbeing.” The school stayed open the first week of the Christmas holidays so pupils could get hot meals. All of the school’s reserves, £,, have now gone. Mr Di‘Iasio says: “The students make the job worthwhile, they make every day a happy day. But it’s when you are looking at the budget and having to make really tough decisions about whether to keep that counsellor or that classroom assistant. They are the darkest days. “But we love our school.” About levelling up, Mr Di‘Iasio says: “I am massively in favour of the concept, but words are cheap and actions speak louder than words.

In an opposition day debate in the Commons, the party will put forward a motion which,passed, would force MPs to vote on the proposals.More than two dozen Tory MPs have in recent years pledged to scrap the tax off home energy bills, including Boris Johnson himself. The Government is expected to abstain on the vote with ministers privately admitting No  needs to get on the front foot over the issue. Mr Johnson told reporters that he understands how people are struggling and he was looking at what we can do to help. Labour wants to impose a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to fund measures to ease the cost of living squeeze, by reducing the average household energy bill by £. Fossil fuel giants would be forced to contribute £.bn to help fund the proposals, through a year-long increase to their corporation tax of %. The £.bn plan would also include removing VAT on domestic energy bills for a whole year, as well as expanding and increasing the warm homes discount to . million people. The Government has so far resisted making moves on VAT with the PM dismissing it as a blunt instrument and Nadhim Zahawi saying oil and gas firms were already struggling. However, Labour claimed the industry was expected to report a near-record income in  .They pointed to previous Tory pledges on VAT on energy bills by senior Tories including Mr Johnson, Michael Gove, Priti Patel and Esther McVey and  others.Mr Johnson said in  that leaving the EU would allow the UK to scrap VAT on energy bills, calling it unfair. Shadow climate change minister Ed Miliband said: All the Tory MPs who have previously backed a VAT cut on home energy bills should follow through with their promises and vote with Labour today to scrap the tax for a year, as hard-working people face a growing cost-of-living crisis. It tells you everything you need to know about this Government that they believe we should prioritise oil and gas companies making huge windfall profits that they say are aposstrugglingapos, rather than the British people who face the true struggle to pay their energy bills. No  has admitted that ministers recognise that people are facing increased costs on things like both food and fuel globally. But Labour rejected that the issues were caused solely by global factors, instead pointing to what they called a decade of failure on energy.

There have been dficulties keeping track of case numbers in recent weeks due to shortages of lateral flow testsand polymerase chain reactiontests. Despite this, case numbers have remained high and have reached record levels since the Omicron iant took a hold on the country. The UKaposs official Covid death toll passed , on Saturday January . Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs government is currently drawing up plan for a living with Covid strategy, which aims to avoid any long-term restrictions in England from March this year.The proposed rule changes may seem like a contradiction to some, so what are they and who do they affect  What is the PCR test rule change   Currently, people who test positive for Covid with no symptoms on a lateral flow test are required to take a PCR to confirm their status. This will change from January .They will still have to isolate for at least seven days, but only from the date of their positive lateral flow test.Head of Imperial College Londonaposs Department of Primary Care  Public Health, Professor Azeem Majeed told the i that the move is a positive step. He said: If you’re positive on lateral flow teststhat’s almost certainly diagnostic of a Covid- infection in the current situation we’re in, as infection rates are so high.By not then having to take a PCR test, it takes pressure off the PCR testing system. What should I doI have a positive LFT   Anyone who tests positive for the virus through an LFT should report their status immediately. The UK Health Security Agencyhas given guidance of how to do this and what will occur afterwards.They said: Under this new approach, anyone who receives a positive LFD test result should report their result on Gov.UK and must self-isolate immediately but will not need to take a follow-up PCR test. At the moment, isolation rules mean that a fully vaccinated person can stop isolating after seven days, proving they take a lateral flow test every day and are negative on days six and seven and have no symptoms. A move to a five-day isolation period is now under consideration. The PM told reporters today: Yes of course, we are looking at that and we will act accordingly to the science as we always have. Is the change to testing permanent   The change brought in has been described as a temporary measure while cases remain high. The UKHSA said: This is a temporary measure while Covid- rates remain high across the UK. Whilst levels of Covid- are high, the vast majority of people with positive [LFT] results can be confident that they have Covid-. The idea is that while cases are in such high numbers, symptoms and a positive test are more likely than normal to indicate the virus. Meanwhile, while case numbers are infrequent and low, a PCR test might be needed to show a positive infection.  The new approach reflects similar changes made this time last year in January , when there was also a high prevalence of infection meaning it was highly likely that a positive [LFT] Covid- result was a true positive. This meant confirmatory PCRs were temporarily paused and reintroduced in March  following a reduction in prevalence.

The Housing Secretary axed £-a-month loans for people in “medium-rise” blocks to pay for fixing cladding. Instead, people in buildings - metres high will not pay a penny for addressing cladding issues after Grenfell. But that’s not strictly true. People are still having to pay for waking watches non-cladding issues aren’t covered by the scheme and people who’ve already doled out cash won’t get it back. Mr Gove announced “we will make industry pay” to fix problems for people in leasehold flats. Those who manufactured combustible cladding and insulation - many of whom have made vast profits, even at the height of the pandemic - they must pay now instead of leaseholders,” he said. There will be £m spent on fire alarms in high-risk buildings and legal amendments will allow flat owners to get compensation for defects up to  years ago .Yet there are questions about what will happenhousing developers try to wriggle out of meeting the bill, as well as when a final package in England will take effect. Here are nine wrinkles in the small print of the plan.Other costs are not includedThe government announced: “No leaseholder living in their own flat will have to pay a penny to fix unsafe cladding.” But critics pointed out residents face many other costs while they wait for their cladding issues to be resolved. MP Clive Efford said residents in one block “have been paying out £, a month for waking watch for nearly four years.” And others have faced higher-than-usual insurance costs lumped into their service charge. Mr Gove insisted: “We are making money available to ensure that we can get rid of waking watch, in all save a very few circumstances.”Non-cladding defects are not includedA leaked letter from the Treasury suggests the plan was not allowed to cover “non-cladding” defects. This is important because cladding is not the only problem any more on blocks of flats. Stricter fire safety laws mean all sorts of issues can be flagged. Shadow Housing Secretary Lisa Nandy said leaseholders “face ruinous costs to fix things such as missing fire breaks and defective compartmentation.” She accused Mr Gove of “abandoning” people with non-cladding safety issues adding: “One cannot make a building half safe.” Mr Gove insisted legal protection is being improved and he agreed “non-cladding costs do need to be met.” Buildings under  metres tall are not includedThe new guidance means residents in all buildings over  metres tall should have their cladding costs covered. But MP Fleur Anderson raised the case of a building under  metres where residents are facing a £m bill. While the biggest issues were in taller buildings, there are still some who could be caught out. Mr Gove admitted: “We require everything to go right in order to be able to help everyone who’s currently facing dficulties.” “I would not want at this stage to provide an absolute guarantee for people whose specic circumstances I’m not yet familiar with.“Some people will still face dficult red tapeMr Gove vowed to “restore common sense to building assessments” by cutting down on the number of “unnecessary” surveys and reports. There will also be “far greater use of sensible, risk-mitigating fire safety measures such as sprinklers and alarms”. And the government is withdrawing interim guidance on needing “EWS” forms - on the external structure of a wall. But there are questions about exactly how many of these forms will be left. Some fear there could still be run-ins between dferent companies or agencies disagreeing about what’s needed. Whatthose who are told to pay up, don’t The government did not say what will happendevelopers refuse or fail to meet the bill. Michael Gove told MPs: “We will give them the chance to do the right thing. I hope that they will take it.“I can confirm to the House today thatthey do not, we will impose a solution on them,necessary, in law.” But there are several questions about whether firms will try to avoid paying the bill. Mr Gove said the “ultimate owners” of a building will be targeted, but there can be complex structures with owners, developers and managers all dferent entities.Will the tax threat be empty Michael Gove pointed out he has been “authorised” to raise the “prospect” of taxing building firm giants. But Ms Nandy pointed out a leaked letter from the Treasury. It showed ministers have warned a decision to impose new taxes is not a given at this point. It appears what heaposs told the public - that tax rises are the backstop - is not what heaposs told the Treasury, she said.Will Mr Gove be forced to rely on his own department’s housing budgets Some fear the policy could ‘rob Peter to pay Paul’developers fail to pay and there is no tax either. The leaked Treasury letter confirmed the Housing Department’s own budget is a “backstop” for the £bn cost. And housing select committee chairman Clive Betts raised fears it could harm new social housing. He said: If developers donapost pay for the measures in the House today or taxes arenapost raised and there are cuts to his budget as a result, is that going to come off social housing provision as well  What assessment has been done for the total impact on future housebuilding for social housing  Mr Gove replied only that he would “do everything possible” to avoid an impact on social housing.How long will we wait Mr Gove told MPs: “I will today write to developers to convene a meeting in the next few weeks, and I will report back to the House before Easter.“ His department said the industry had been “given two months to agree to a financial contributions scheme to fund the new plan, otherwise,necessary, the government will impose a solution in law.” But he did not give a hard deadline for when a plan or law will actually be finalised, or take effect. Labour MP for Putney Fleur Anderson asked: When will the deadline for this chance to do the right thing be up “Otherwise we could just be kicking the can down the road. Leaseholders in Putney will want to know when they can expect to be able to sell their homes to move on.People won’t get their money backSome leaseholders have already paid out money to fix issues with their flats. Yet Mr Gove insisted the government “can’t resolve every issue from the past”. He added: I canapost unfortunately... say that we will be in a position to compensate those who have already contributed. What weaposre seeking to do is to ensure that iniduals do not face costs in the future. But again I will work with colleagues across this House in order to try to get to the most equitable position possible.

Oliver Dowden issued the warning moments before the “bring your own booze” bash - which multiple sources claim Boris Johnson attended with his we Carrie. And just five days later, the Prime Minister himself said police should intervene to stop people having outdoor parties. Mr Johnson has been plunged into a fresh scandal over the bash on May , .A bombshell e-mail obtained by ITV News showed more than  No staff were invited by the PM’s top civil servant and told to ‘bring your own booze’.Outdoor gatherings were banned in England at the time under Covid rules. Now footage has emerged of then-Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden speaking at a No press conference, just  minutes before the pm bash out the back door.  He urged hard-pressed citizens to “limit contact with other people”, and said: “You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place - provided that you stay two metres apart. The Cabinet minister warned “staying alert for the vast majority of people still means staying at home as much as possible.”Mr Dowden added: “If everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus.“This is how we can continue to save lives and livelihoods as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.”  Just five days after the outdoor gathering, Boris Johnson said police should intervene to stop outdoor gatherings. He was asked by a member of the public: “There are large groups gathering in local parks, ignoring social distancing rules. When many of us are being so vigilant and staying alert, what can be done to discourage this disregard for the rules ” The PM replied: “Feel free to speak to people yourselfyou feel that they are not obeying the rules. “But the police will step innecessary and encourage people to obey the law. Boris Johnson ’s Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds faces a fight for his job after the May  e-mail was revealed by ITV News. And sources now expect Whitehallaposs parties investigator Sue Gray will have to interview the Prime Minister himself - as he was said to have been present at four of the events she is looking into.In a screenshot of the email obtained by ITV News, Mr Reynolds wrote: Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No garden this evening.Please join us from pm and bring your own booze!According to the BBC, staff raised questions privately at the time with one saying: “Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden ”.Another wrote: “Is this for real ” The May  gathering was revealed last week by ex-Downing Street aideDominic Cummings , who has gone to war with his former boss since leaving Government in November .Hannah Brady, spokesperson for Covid  Bereaved Families for Justice, said: My Dad died just four days before this email was sent out, he was only  and was a fit and healthy key worker.” She added: “How can those running the country have thought it was OK  Could there be a more disgraceful example of aposone rule for them, and another rule for the rest of usapos  “To make matters worse, in September last year I sat in that same Garden, looked the Prime Minister in the eyes and told him how my dad had died. “He told me he had ‘done everything he could’ to protect my Dad, knowing that he had partied in that same spot the very day that Dad’s death certicate was signed. “It makes me feel sick to think about it.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonCabinetCivil servantsPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Kate Grfiths said I am no longer silenced by the family courts” and I can speak out” after a y saga involving her ex Andrew Grfiths. Mr Grfiths used to be the MP for Burton and the minister for small business, and once worked as former prime minister Theresa Mayaposs chief of staff.He resigned in  after the Sunday Mirror revealed he sent depraved messages to two constituents.  The Grfiths, both , became embroiled in private family court proceedings, centred on a child, after separating.During those proceedings, a family court judge concluded that, on the balance of probability, Mr Grfiths had raped and physically abused Ms Grfiths.  Ms Grfiths was speaking on a Tortoise Media podcast after Court of Appeal judges ruled the rape finding could be made public. Ms Grfiths said the pair met in  before Mr Grfiths became an MP, and began a relationship  months later. He was great, he was funny, he was a charmer, said Ms Grfiths. I thought he was an all-round good guy. He was very attentive. Ms Grfiths said people would say they were an ideal couple. But she added: By the end of the relationship, I had just become a shadow of my former self. Three appeal judges last month ruled the family court judgeaposs findings could be made public after a -month legal fight by two media organisations - Tortoise and PA Media. Ms Grfiths had waived her right to anonymity and supported the fight by journalists. She said publication would allow her to help constituents. Itaposs like a feeling of freedom, she said. Mr Grfiths had strongly denied allegations made against him, and argued that the family court judgeaposs findings should not be made public. He said the judgeaposs findings should stay private in order to protect the child at the centre of the case. Judges ruled that neither the gender nor the name of the child at the centre of proceedings could be revealed in media reports.

Today the Daily Mirror takes a detailed look at le in areas the Conservatives claim they now care about. The picture is bleak, with little or no progress since Boris Johnson won an -seat majority at the  General Election. Over-promising and under-delivering is a hallmark of this Prime Minister. The rundown school we highlight today, where heroic teachers and other staff struggle to keep going in crumbling buildings, is unfortunately not an exception. Working people deserve better and the pupils deserve an education in fit-for-purpose facilities. But in this country Government policies are levelling us down instead of up. Staff our NHS  With an understaffed NHS on its knees, axing key staff because they are unvaccinated would be self-destructive. The boss of one of London’s busiest hospitals warning as many as % of his workforce could need moving shows what happens when the tricky real world collides with Whitehall diktat. Of course, those in the health service should be jabbed, to protect patients, colleagues and the public as well as themselves. Yet the no jab, no job order could prove ruinous to the provision of healthcare. Daily pre-work tests are expensive and burdensome but it would surely be better to use them than to lose the skills and expertise of people who, for whatever reason, have failed to get inoculated, or chosen not to. Pitch in, Andy The Duke of York’s ongoing legal troubles in the US civil courts cast a dark shadow over the Queen’s planned Platinum Jubilee celebrations in early June. If Prince Andrew wants to make a positive contribution to the national occasion, he should bake his mum a cake to mark it. It’d be no sweat.

Even though the next election is two years away Mr Houchen said the Government had to start delivering tangible change now. Writing in The Times, he told the PM: “Before the next election comes around people need to see with their eyes concrete evidence that they were right to back this Government.  “Voters are also realists - they know that levelling up is not something that will be delivered in just a year or two, it will be a decades long project. But they do need to see progress.” Without early signs of change, he warned that voters could desert the Tories in droves.  Mr Houchen, who was re-elected last year with .% of the vote, said: “People like to be proven right and those who voted Conservative for the first time in  are looking for an excuse to do so again, but they will punish a Government which makes them regret their choices.” Mr Houchen claimed that the Covid vaccine and the booster roll-out would not be enough to guarantee re-election.  “It’s time for the Prime Minister to focus, remember what got him elected two years ago and what the British people need to see tohim as Prime Minister at the next election.“Boris has got booster jabs in British arms - now he needs to make sure Britain gets the Brexit boost it needs: jobs, investment, growth, levelling up and a better future for every part of our country.” Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, asked on LBC whether the PM was failing to deliver on his promises, said: “We’re going to get on with the job, we’re going to deliver investment in communities that need it.”Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyThe TimesMichael GoveBoris JohnsonPoliticsDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Blaming the BBC is wrong and cowardly when the Government forced the broadcaster to take responsibility for callous cuts. People who worked hard all their lives deserve dignity – not contempt – in their later years.  Turn up heat Labour is drawing a thick red line between itself and the Conservatives today by challenging Tory MPs to support cuts in rising energy bills. Detailed plans by Keir Starmer’s party would suspend VAT and slash £ from average bills, reducing heating and lighting charges for the poorest households by as much as £. Labour’s proposed windfall tax is entirely justied on soaring profits of North Sea oil and gas producers when money is flooding into corporate coffers.

Forget record high NHS waiting lists and crumbling schools when Tory Cabinet Ministers lie in front of giant Union Jacks to illustrate their intense patriotism. And ignore sleaze, corruption, back-handers, unfairness, inequality and fatal mistakes for, with the blessing of Culture Wars Secretary Nadine Dorries, Tory no-mark Andrew Rosindell wants the BBC to play God Save the Queen every day. Statues, flags and anthems are battlegrounds the PM’s smokescreen to ert public attention away from his tax hikes, soaring fuel bills, cost of living rises, stagnant wages and declining public services.  It is a classic, cynical Right-wing strategy to ide and rule. It played well in the past and it might work again. Magicians use misdirection as a form of deception to draw the audience’s attention from the real action. Johnson would rather voters were angry about a jury clearing four protesters over the toppling of slaver Edward Colston’s statue in Bristol than holding the PM to account for increased National Insurance or discussing Labour’s proposed windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to compensate households who are facing huge increases in energy bills.  Suella Braverman is an Attorney-General whose ideological conviction results in much of the legal profession judging her guilty of stupidity. Even considering an appeal against the jury verdict in the Colston case is a sign the governing party will roll in the gutter. Labour leader Keir Starmer is wise to take no lectures on patriotism from a Conservative regime which inflicted the terrible national self-harm that is Brexit. But in a fight, the Labour leader is similarly wise to combat smears which saw predecessor Jeremy Corbyn unfairly tainted as hating his country. Labour wins by keeping the national conversation on big issues that really count, the Tories by changing it to emblems and frippery.

Isabelle Grundy, six, has been battling cancer for six months, and her parents are desperately seeking treatment from abroad.The youngster, from Thornton Cleveleys, was a happy little girl before her le-changing diagnosis in the summer of , LancsLive reports. Isabelle woke up complaining to mum Louisa Moss that she had a sore tummy and she was off school with a suspected bug. Her condition became worse throughout the day and Louisa found a lump on the left side of her stomach. Louisa, , said: It was quite sudden, previous to this day, I noticed she was tired but I canapost say that she was ill- when itaposs your own kids you pick up very quicklyitaposs anything more. This lump that I found in Isabelleaposs tummy it wasnapost an obvious lump and not somewhere you would go poking and prodding - I just couldnapost believe it. I kind of knew when I felt the lump and did a bit of research, I knew then and there that it wasnapost going to be good news - at the same time I was doubting myself thinking no it canapost be because of how well sheaposs been. Isabelle was seen by GPs, hospitals and specialists before she was diagnosed with a High Risk, Stage  Neuroblastoma. Such a diagnosis comes with a  per cent survival rate.A week later, she was enduring a world of appointments, therapies and treatments all before she even turned six.

Louisa said: On the rd of December, we just knew she wasnapost right, her tummy was distended, she needed to go to the toilet but couldnapost pass any urine. She just looked so poorly, she was wanting to sleep a lot- she went for an ultrasound on Christmas Eve morning and they found she was full of fluid. Isabelle spent Christmas and New Yearaposs in a hospital bed - not being able to open her presents. The mum added: It was heartbreaking, it was awful. It was just me and Isabelleaposs big brother on Christmas morning so we Facetimed daddy and Isabelle was completely oblivious. She was fast asleep at the time which she was like the majority of the time. We have such a big family so not seeing any our family at Christmas was hard - we didnapost want them to come up here because of Covid we just had to be so careful who we were mixing with. We canapost really say it was Christmas at all, it was just horrible. Isabelle still has a  per cent survival rate as her family are looking for other options abroad. They found a vaccination that is given in New York and it can reduce the risk of the cancer ing and will increase her chances of living a longer le.

Charlotte Taundry, , was playing the confectionary-based game over the New Year with partner Sarah Hutchison, , as well as their friends and family. But when it was her turn to play the game - in which players try to move one of the chocolates from their heads to their mouths without using their hands- she had to admit defeat. Speaking afterwards she explained it was because, try as she might, she could not move her face muscles because of the temporary face paralyser.In a video Sarah can be heard laughing hysterically as Charlotte, who she met on ITV ’s The Cabins, tries to move the choccie treat which refuses to budge.Charlotte, a trainee dietician, said: When that video was filmed Iaposd already been doing it five minutes. It just wasnapost happening. I just kept thinking, aposI look awfulapos - pulling the most stupid facial expressions. “But it was so funny, I had to do it. I was wiping my tears away I was laughing that much. “Hopefully it give some people a laugh. Sarah added: “I was just creasing laughing. We both have botox. We canapost tell when we’re annoyed at each other - itaposs great.  But she was determined and stuck it on her head. I watched everyone  get it to their mouth - [while Charlotte] sat there squinting and squeezing her face. It comes as the happy couple announced recently they are planning on starting IVF as they want a family.They told The Sun Charlotte will carry the baby.She said: “We know where we are going to go with it in a few years time. I’m obviously  now, so approaching the age where we need to start thinking about children. We’ve thought about stuff like that [IVF], we haven’t got an exact plan in mind but we know over the next few years it’s definitely where we are going.

The pose is far from new. It is one which has been used repeatedly down the decades to capture a young princess or duchess coming of age, their elegant footing firm on the path to queendom. As well as by female monarchs well established in their reign. Queen Victoria, Queen Mary, the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret, Diana, even Princess Grace of Monaco, not to mention our current Queen, have struck similar poses. The combination of romanticism and regality is recognisable straightaway as Kate holds a mirror to former eras. Royal commentator Ingrid Seward explains: “In this image I think you see a nod to Kate rising up the ranks. People look at her and see the perfect queen, young and beautul. “It evokes an image of the Queen as a young woman and even conjures up historically a Boadicea, strong, yet feminine - femininity yet strength. “That idealised image of a young queen, serene, in control and poised.” She adds: “Kate is coming into her own. She is genuinely involved in her charity work, which will be her legacy. “We have seen her in the peacemaker role between William and Harry, we saw her at the carol concert in Westminster stepping confidently into the spotlight, she is no longer a clothes horse, there is a strength there now. “We can see Kate stepping up a level, the coming of a queen in waiting, and I think she is more ready to fill those shoes.” But she stresses the Duchess will no doubt feel embarrassed by the attention on her position. She’s been in The Firm long enough to know she must not overstep the mark. “Prince Charles is not even King yet and the Royals are very careful about not upstaging each other. Kate will be keen not to upstage Camilla,” says Ingrid. “She is aware of hierarchy and that it is Camilla’s turn. “But she is a wonderful advert for the monarchy, especially globally, and people will see her as the perfect queen.”  Platinum puddings By Tyrese ChinDenCoy What better way to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee this year than with cake  Her Maj has decreed a Royal Bake Off, asking the nation to come up with a pud we can all raise a spoon to. Fortnum and Mason and The Big Jubilee Lunch invite Britain’s bakers, aged eight and above, to create a dish that can be replicated across the country to celebrate the -year milestone.  Five finalists will have the chance to bake their dishes at Fortnum’s store in Piccadilly to be judged by Dame Mary Berry, palace head chef Mark Flanagan and Masterchef list Monica Galetti. Why not take some inspiration from Royal favourites, old or new  From Prince William’s chocolate biscuit cake to Henry the VIII’s favourite red wine and ginger jelly or Queen Victoria’s famous Victoria Sponge, they’re a family of sweet tooths. Henry VIII Favourite Food: Jelly Hippocras. Henry VIII was a large man and would often have over  freshly cooked dishes served for him every day. He loved his red wine and even built two fountains which spouted hundreds of gallons of the stuff for him and his courtiers to enjoy everyday. Alongside it, Henry particularly liked this jelly which included wine, ginger and cinnamon. Victoria I Favourite Food: Victoria Sponge Cake Queen Victoria was someone who enjoyed eating and was said to have had a hearty appetite. She enjoyed sweet foods from ice-creams to pastries, and cake so much that the Victoria Sponge was named after her. Duchess Kate Favourite Food: Sticky Toffee Pudding Kate’s fav foods reportedly include sushi and Italian - the latter because it’s easy to cook with ther kids and let them get their hands messy. But when it comes to favourite puds it’s a spongy Sticky Toffee Pudding. Prince William Favourite Food: Chocolate biscuit cake The Duke is a big fan of chocolate biscuit cakes, so much so the cake was served at his wedding. William’s fondness for the cake apparently comes from a specic recipe which he learnt from his grandmother, the Queen.

She is thought to have spent the day of her birthday yesterday privately with her family having a low-key celebration.And this could have suited Kate perfectly, who even in her university days wasnapost one for tearing the town up and could apparently nurse one glass of wine all night. In her book Kate: The Future Queen, royal author Katie Nicholl speaks to an unnamed friend, who joined Kate on a gap year trip to Italy. The friend claimed: Sheaposd get giggly and silly after a few glasses, so then she would stop.  She was never interested in getting really drunk. She wasnapost really a party girl. She wasnapost uptight or boring, she was really fun and lovely, but going out and getting wasted wasnapost really her thing.But one party she wasnapost able to get out of having was her hen party in , shortly before marrying Prince William.Kateaposs sister Pippa reportedly organised a private do at the house of a friend, with the guest list kept to a minimum.

Gavin Quinn, a sports reporter, lost five stone in seven months with regular meals and exercise. The feat is even more astonishing because he did not once go to the gym during his weight loss journey. He puts his remarkable loss down to a combination of diet and exercise. Gavin, who writes for the Irish Mirror, shed the weight in seven months, but rewarded himself with some snacks along the way. BelfastLive reports that he had started to gain weight when he was a teenager.He said: I lost  poundsin seven months after deciding to make a change in October .Tipping the scales at around  stone, I wasnapost massively overweight but Iaposd noticed a gradual increase since I was a teenager that was accelerated by the initial Covid- lockdown.I looked into what I was eating and slowly turned around my diet and found cycling as a great way to get active to complement the changes Iaposd made. By Christmas I had lost over two stone and I kept it up in the New Year before hitting the five stone mark in May .  Gavinaposs weight continued to fall to  stoneand he eased off and worked on fitness goals rather than weight. He said for some people this was an epiphany moment similar to a favourite shirt no longer fitting them. Gavin added: But for me it was just a culmination of all the right things, I donapost have any overriding reason for making a change. At the time Ireland was staring at another Covid- lockdown which lasted seven months. Iaposd tried almost all of the aposfad dietsapos to no avail in the months and years before, and I could just feel my confidence was at an all-time-low, Gavin added. And on October , a Sunday morning, I said to myself that I need to make a change and that day would be day one. He tackled his eating and sleeping habits first and establishing a structure to his diet. Gavin gave himself a simple plan to start off with get eight hours sleep and have three meals a day at roughly the same time of day.  I set myself a rough target of , daily calories and used apps such as MyFitnessPal to help track what I was eating, Gavin added. Initially I didnapost pay too much attention to my macro-nutrients, but made an effort to ensure I was drinking plenty of water, eating foods with high fibre, vitamins and lower fat counts - particularly saturated fats. This meant I still had treats and snacks to enjoy, but the small changes slowly begin to add up and the , calories I consumed each day began to feel like more and more as the days and weeks went by. Some days it was , calories and other days it was , calories - donapost beat yourself up over going over your allowance every once in a while. Itaposs not about cutting yourself off from food, but rather improving your relationship with food.  The amazing thing about Gavinaposs weight loss was he did not join a gym. He never had great interest in the gym and hadnapost done when he was younger. Personally, I never took to the gym when I was younger and always liked to exercise as a means of engaging in a sport or activity, Gavin said. Gyms can be intimidatingyouaposve never become a member, but Iaposd suggest anybody looking to get active consider it. For me, I found a means to exercise in cycling - which has grown into somewhat of a passion for me over the past  months. Here are more of Gavinaposs aposs top tips on how he did it, from his diet to level of exercise:How did you manage your diet It can be dficult to follow a calorie deficit, when youaposre consuming less calories than youaposre burning your body is being forced to eat into fat reserves to fill that void. I made sure not to overdo it - deliberately eating just , calories per day can be too much and you could risk reverting back to old ways. Having my breakfast and lunches at very similar timeshelped build early eating habits that would set me up for the day. Again to ensure I wasnapost completely flipping my diet completely I used a degree of leniency when it came to dinner time, small changes like portion control and avoiding fatty foods when you have the option can make all the dference. Initially I found myself eating a lot of the same foods I already had, particularly snacks, but doing so meant Iaposd simply be eating less of what I used to rather than eating right. After the first week I began replacing some snack foods with lower calorie snacks, which in turn meant I had more calories to play with for my substantial meals. If I was eating a pack of  calorie crisps, Iaposd replace them with  calorie crisps, swap the Cadbury chocolate bars for lower calorie rice cake bars, treating myself to a zero calorie fizzy drink rather than a full sugar alternative. This meant I still had treats and snacks to enjoy, but the small changes slowly begin to add up and the , calories I consumed each day began to feel like more and more as the days and weeks went by. Some days it was , calories and other days it was , calories - donapost beat yourself up over going over your allowance every once in a while. Itaposs not about cutting yourself off from food, but rather improving your relationship with food.What are your favoured foods for weight loss Iaposve found so many great foods the past  months that I never enjoyed before, and Iaposd be confident in saying my relationship with food has really grown as I became more aware of what I was putting into my body. Hereaposs some of my favoured foods these days: Cous Cous: I sometimes use it as a lighter alternative to rice, itaposs easy to make and is high in carbohydrates and fibre.Rice crispy bars: Excellent for a quick snack, theyaposre a lot better than a bar of chocolate.Lentil curls: A low calorie alternative to many brands of crisps, Iaposve grown to love them.Nuts and seeds: A great snack, good source of protein and fats.Turkey burgers: Lean, high in protein and delicious - no explanation needed.Vegetables: Whatever they are eat plenty of them, theyaposre good for you and should be an essential pillar of your diet. Did you give up takeaways and alcohol Not really. Weaposve always had a aposTakeaway Fridayapos at home so I made sure to allow myself the Friday treat. Although instead of chips in the chinese takeaway some weeks Iaposd get rice or even eat a smaller portion. I initially gave up alcohol until Christmas, but when I did drink I opted for lower calorie light beers or spirits more often than not instead of calorie-dense lagers or stout.Do you need support to lose weight Everybody needs support when undertaking such a big change. Whether that be a personal trainer, or just a family member or close friend, Iaposd recommend you get someone on board to be there for support. In my case, I asked a close friend to act almost like my aposcoachapos to keep me honest. He would get in touch every now and then to see how I was getting on, was there to listenI had problems and cheer me on to my goals. Needless to say that educated professionals are much more qualied to play such a role, but having someone to bounce off and hold you accountable on the journey is essential.Did you almost give up Yeah, I came pretty close on November . I was making good progress in the weeks before but that morning I weighed in after a particularly tough week and had lost just one pound. In hindsight losing a pound in a week is a good achievement, but that week had been so dficult and the loss was a lot lower than I was expecting. I was agitated and questioning what I was doing for hours before I was convinced to take an hour to go on a short cycle to clear my mind. If I hadnapost walked out to get some headspace I wouldaposve broken and dialled back weeks of progress, especially since Iaposd already been fully committed to nearly a month. If youaposre about to give in - take a step back and remember why youaposre doing it.What do you doyou lose motivation Some days you just wake up and the same motivation you initially had just isnapost there - itaposll happen to everybody. Of course motivation is great, but it comes and goes. Behind the motivation you do need to have a certain amount of discipline. It can be very tough but you need discipline for when the inspiration and motivation just isnapost there. Weekly goals can help keep you focused.When did you start to see results The real goal wasnapost to get down to a certain weight or number, it was to feel good and take back some confidence that Iaposd probably lost. I started to notice a dference in how I looked around Christmas time , but had already felt better after about  days or so. I tipped the scales initially every week but increased that to twice weekly to avoid any discouraging fluctuations. Weighing yourself can be a good way of mapping out progress, but itaposs not the most important. If youaposre not getting the expected results one week, donapost get discouraged, itaposs important to make sure to keep doing the right things - the results will come.How important was exercise to your weight loss Quite important. I found a passion in cycling during my weight loss journey, but any form of exercise can give you similar results. Some people like running, walking, playing certain sports or of course the gym. It really doesnapost matter what your form of exercise is,you have a healthy and balanced diet then exercise is your best friend. Think of it as a complimentary relationship, the old saying of you cant out-exercise a bad diet can also be true for having a healthy diet but sitting on the couch all day. As little as a walk in the park, a short hike, leisurely bike ride or a dip in the sea can compliment whatever calories deficits youaposre creating and help you reach your goals faster. Butyou are taking on more rigorous exercise, itaposs important to ensure you arenapost creating too large of a deficit and are re-fuelling adequately.What are your golden rules for weight loss Everyone has their golden rules for weight loss, and although these particularly rules wonapost work for everyone, hereaposs a couple of mine: - Calorie deficit: If you create a daily calorie deficit, you will lose weight. Itaposs simple when you break it down like that. - Always treat yourself: Itaposs not about burning your bridges with certain foods, itaposs about improving your relationship with food. - Take your time: Thereaposs no rush, everyoneaposs bodies are dferent and once youaposre moving in the right direction thataposs all that matters. - Find your support network: Find someone to keep you on the right path and hold you accountable in the long run. - Exercise: Doesnapost matter what it is, get out there and get active. - Listen to your body: If youaposre hungry, eat something. If youaposre over-exercising, rest.Whataposs your advice to someone hoping to start their own journey If you were to take one thing from reading this, it would be my real golden rule. Sustainability. Whatever habits, calorie deficits or exercise regimes youaposre trying to put in place - you have to ask yourselfitaposs sustainable. When I set out to lose some weight, the one huge dference between all my failed attempts in the past was I asked myself is it sustainable  You should be trying to implementing a lestyle, not a aposlose weight quickapos hack. When you start on day one, ask yourself could you see yourself doing the same on day  or day   Because to lose weight and live a healthy and well balanced lestyle, whatever way you go about it needs be sustainable in the long term.

Tamas Dominko, , was caught out by the client who spotted the device as she went to get changed for the treatment - and turned it to face away from her before replacing it. After the treatment, she moved the phone again while dressing, then checked the screen to see it was still recording and had captured the massage. Ealing Magistrates’ Court heard the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, felt threatened after seeing the phone at a massage parlour in west London. She said in a statement she did not know how to deal with the discovery and spent the massage in fear there would be an altercation. Prosecutor Maya Arputham said: The defendant was in a massage centre as a contractor. He gets clients and they come in hourly for massages. This complainant comes in, she has been coming for three years and he has dealt with her before. On that day she realised something was very wrong. She sees a phone on a shelf, she turns the phone and undresses herself. She continued with the massage. Afterwards she looked at the phone and it was still recording and she was shocked. She took the phone from the shelf and went directly to the receptionist. In a statement, the victim said: It made me feel quite shocked and threatened through the appointment. I didnapost know how to deal with it in the massage and felt incredibly vulnerable as I was stuck in the room with Tamas almost completely naked and feared some altercation was coming.” Tamasin Graham, defending, said the father-of-one is seeking help for his “compulsive sexual behaviour” after the incident in July last year and has ended his career as a masseuse.

Longstaffe is the writers middle nameMiners strike in  Image: Daily RecordopinionByPaul Routledge:,  Jan | commentsIt was something of a mystery why I was attracted to the cause of the miners. True, the National Union of Mineworkers was never out of the headlines in the Seventies and Eighties when I was Labour Editor of The Times. But that didn’t quite explain why I felt at home with them. Now I learn that it’s been in my blood for nigh on  years. The  Census shows my forebear Joseph Routledge, born in Durham in , was a miner, living in Shinclfe and married to Alice, nee Longstaff. Longstaffe is my middle name. I don’t know where the “e” came from.  Joseph and his family became Mormons and for a time he emigrated to Salt Lake City in the USA before ing, disillusioned, to his native county. Joseph went back into mining, studied hard and gained a manager’s certicate and was in charge of Ryhope colliery, Sunderland, for at least  years. Joseph was also the co-inventor of a safety lamp for use underground, and must have been quite well thought-of despite being the boss, credited with trying to keep the miners happy. He died in , and his widow, Alice,  years later. They are both commemorated in a stained-glass window in St Paul’s Church, Ryhope. Remarkable. I was dimly aware of these facts before, in relation to a novel by the Sunderland writer Glenda Craig. But I am indebted to the Routledge Clan Society, of which I am now a member, and its newsletter, The Blackmail, for the full story. No, I don’t know why they call it that – something  to find out.

The obsessed lurker also went into her tattoo shop, called One by One, and made lewd sexual comments. His cruel campaign stopped for five years, but he ed in  and carried on gorping at her through the window until she called the police. He was banned from contacting Green, who models under the name Arabella Drummond, for the rest of his le in October  under the terms of a restraining order. But Westminster Magistrates Court heard he breached the ban for a third and fourth time when he walked past her shop on Berwick Street on  July and  July last year. The paranoid schizophrenic was also in breach of a suspended sentence imposed for breaching the restraining order. In addition, he performed a sex act in front of another woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, on a bus in East London, on  July last year. El-Habachi, of Forest Gate, east London, later told police he was just aposdoing something with my trousersapos despite being caught in the act on CCTV. He also stole cans of Red Bull from a Greggs store on  July last year. He admitted exposure, theft, one count of breaching a restraining order and breaching a suspended sentence at previous first appearances before a magistrates court. The defendant admitted a second count of breaching a restraining order on the first day of his trial in November last year. His  week jail term was suspended for a year and a half and he was told to carry out  rehabilitation days and live under an pm- am curfew for  days. He must also pay £ compensation to the exposure victim and £ in court costs. An application by prosecutors to make him abide by a Sexual Harm Prevention Order was thrown out. Ms Green said she wants to have a baby with her partner, but has so far been put off trying for one because she is worried about the effect more encounters with her stalker will have on the child. She added: Thisincident has made me feel extremely devastated that this has started all over again. I have had to deal with this man for so many years and I fear coming to work or going to lunch. This situation is affecting my relationship with my partner and there are days when I want to leave the country. There have been days of crying and worrying. I am tired of losing my le over this male and I just want this to end. I feel constantly in danger. Luke Staton, prosecuting, said: At around  am on  July last year a woman boarded a bus and around two stops later the defendant boarded the bus and sat to the right of her in the back row. She could see out of the corner of her eye that there were some movements coming from the defendant. When she looked towards him, she could see him he was masturbating with one hand while he looked at her and aposside-eyedapos her. The victim went to the driver to explain what happened and while she was doing that the defendant got off the bus. She asked the driver to report the incident and the defendant was caught on CCTV and identied. When interviewed by police the defendant made no comment other than to say aposI was not masturbating, I was just doing something with my trousers.apos On  July last year, in breach of a restraining order imposed on  October , the defendant was seen on Berwick Street by a member of staff who works with Ms Green. There was no communication at all between the defendant and the victim. He walked past the store and glanced towards it for around two seconds. On  July last year the defendant was seen by the victimaposs manager walking past the store briefly and looking in the direction of the store before walking on. The reason the restraining order was imposed was because he was walking past the store several times every day in the past. Mohammed Naqvi, in mitigation, said: The defendant has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and is close to being diagnosed with autism. He used to live with his elderly mother who is ill but since September he has been living in supported accommodation. He is now receiving much better, intensive, daily support. He has also been offered treatment at a stalking clinic which would help him. Prison would have a detrimental effect on his mental health which could deteriorate drastically as prison would be quite frightening for him. He could lose his place in supported accommodationhe were to be sent to prison today. He can undertake rehabilitation days as part of a community order. The court can follow the probation report and spare him prison today. In regards to the breaches of the restraining order, he has walked past, there has not been any interaction and on one occasion the victim had to be notied about. District Judge Neeta Minhas told him: You cannot commit any further offences or breach any orders. If you do anything like that you will go to prison. I am not sure how many more chances can be given to you. The reason I have not sent you to prison is because you are in supported housing. You will lose thatyou go to prison. You would be in a worse positionyou were to lose that, and society would be put at greater riskyou lose your housing. You have run out of chances this is probably your last. If you breach the order or offend again, not even your personal circumstances will be able to keep you out of prison.

Joanne Freeman, , had contracted coronavirus two weeks earlier which had likely caused blood clots leading to the le-threatening medical condition when blood is cut off from the brain.She arrived at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf at noon last Thursday but was moved to three dferent ambulances as paramedics finished their sht.The pensioner was screaming in agony and her hands were over her eyes when her family called for an ambulance around .am, a close relative said, reports Wales Online. She was saying her head was absolutely killing her. She lives by herself but has a carer who comes in four times a day who told us she was very distressed, they explained.Have you faced similar delays at hospital  Let us know at webnews@mirror Attempts were made to give Mrs Freeman paracetamol and other medication but she couldnapost take them or open her eyes. Mrs Freeman was eventually given an IV drip and her family reached the hospital but had to wait outside in the ambulance. The family member said she felt sorry for the paramedics as they changed shts, with one allegedly revealing there were  standing calls but none could be attended to as all ambulances were in use. They said there were a total of  waiting outside the hospital with patients inside. Mrs Freeman was allegedly still being given paracetamol once sheaposd been admitted and the relativeaposs brother-in-law had to raise his voice to get things sorted and a scan arranged, they claimed.  He had to ask them to put fresh bedding on and change the dressing on her back - nothing was given, we had to prompt them, they continued. At midnight -  hours after Mrs Freeman was first struck ill - her family was finally told sheaposd suffered a stroke and at am she was moved to a specialist ward. Referring to the stroke likely stemming from blood clots caused by Covid, the relative said: We had been waiting for her booster for ages but as itaposs a home visit she needs, there is a delay. Mrs Freeman caught Covid from one of her carers and came out of isolation on December . Her relative said: Itaposs just diabolical in there. I felt like I was in a third world country. You wouldnapost treat a dog like that. They were saying she needs to drink water yet ignoring that she couldnapost even hold a cup up.  We had to ask them for a drip. I know itaposs because they are understaffed because of Covid so lack a lot of staff and resources but to think Joanne was treated as an urgent patient but still didnapost get seen for  hours is crazy. What baffles me is how she kept saying how much pain she was in and was having a stroke but she wasnapost seen for that amount of time. If it was a -year-old person, would they be treated in the same way  Or is it because thereaposs not space at the hospital  Itaposs just ludicrous. I feel like I was leaving her le in danger by leaving her in their care. It never used to be like that.

And his dad Prince William revealed that activity was carrying out litter picking sessions, which left his son frustrated about the state of the planet. Speaking to a BBC podcast last year, William ulged: So George at school recently has been doing litter picking and I didnapost realise but talking to him the other day he was already showing that he was getting a bit confused and a bit sort of annoyed by the fact they went out litter picking one day and then the very next day they did the same route, same time and pretty much all the same litter they picked up back again.And I think that for him he was trying to understand how and where it all came from. He couldnapost understand, heaposs like, aposwell, we cleaned this. Why has it not gone away ’  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. William has been very vocal in the past  months about turning the tide on climate change and environmental problems.And heaposs previously said that he was concerned that George and his generation might still be talking about climate change in decades to come.  He added: But it shouldnapost be that thereaposs a third-generation now coming along having to ramp it up even more. And you know, for me, it would be an absolute disasterGeorge is sat here talking to you or your successor, you know in like  years time, whatever, still saying the same thing, because by then we will be too late.  It is thought that George and Charlotteaposs younger brother Prince Louis will join them at the same school in September after he turns four in April.As part of William and Kateaposs wishes to give them as normal an upbringing as possible, as soon as they walk through the school gates their kids are treated like any other child.And this means they must do what teachers tell them and follow the schoolaposs most important rule - just like everyone . Its website states: As you would expect of any Thomasaposs school, the most important school rule is aposBe Kindapos.

The pictures were snapped during a secret photoshoot at Kew Gardens last November by famous fashion photographer Paolo Roversi, whose previous work has graced the pages of Vogue and Vanity Fair. And Mr Roversi has opened up on exactly how he came to work with Kate and how he also snapped some special photos that are likely to remain private... First meeting The first meeting between Kate and Mr Roversi came last November at Kensington Palace, where the photographer says they met for tea and biscuits.And during this meeting, he says he found Kate a little nervous about carrying out the shoot.He told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera : “At first the Duchess was apprehensive. She is machine-gunned by photographers every day but is not used to posing.“Knowing my photos with models she was a little fearful of facing a real session, which required about four hours of work. But I reassured her that once we started it was going to be very easy. Dresses and jewellery Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.In the portraits, Kate wears three absolutely stunning dresses created by a designer who sheaposs worked with numerous times in the past - Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen.Sarahaposs relationship with Kate goes back more than  years as she also created her iconic wedding gown. And it appears her trust in her is steadfast as itaposs been reported Kate allowed Sarah to pick the dresses for the shoot. For the official portrait , Kate wears a stunning light organza dress, which Mr Roversi says makes the duchess look like a classical ballerina.In terms of jewellery, Kate wears her eye-catching engagement ring and in two of the shots, opts for a pair of diamond earrings on loan from the Queen.While in the photo where she wears the red dress, she wears diamond and pearl drop earrings that once belonged to her late mother-in-law Princess Diana.Hair and make-up  When it came to Kateaposs hair and make-up, the photographer was keen for a less is more approach, with a no defined hair style and little make-up. He told the Italian publication: “I didnapost want her to look too Lady Duchess, too establishment, but as pure and contemporary as possible. Or even timeless.” On the shoot  While taking her picture, Mr Roversi said he was moved by Kateaposs warm and friendly welcome and enchanted by her shining eyes that reflected the loveliness of her soul and her smile showing the generosity of her heart. He added: It was a profound and rich experience for me, an unforgettable moment. I have met a wonderful person, a person who, with her positive energy, can bring hope to the whole world. The photographer also revealed that for some of the images he took, he persuaded Kate to dance and twirl across the floor - something sheaposs rarely done in public. He said: In the end I wanted to take some moving pictures, so with that wonderful wide skirt I made her dance in front of my lens, a sort of accelerated waltz mixed with a pinch of rock aposnapos roll. But unfortunately, he says these dancing images are likely to remain private and have not been released. Selecting the images After the shoot, the photographer was left with a set of around  pictures, which he whittled down to .He says he and Kate then worked together to choose the three final portraits. The Italian newspaper suggests that Prince William and their childrenaposs favourite shot is the one where she looks directly into the camera.The photos, part of the National Portrait Gallery’s Coming Home exhibition, will go on display in Berkshire, where Kate grew up, St Andrews, where she met Prince William, and Anglesey, their first marital home.And yesterday, Kate thanked her many well-wishers on Twitter, in a rare personal tweet. She said: Thank you for all of your very kind birthday wishes, and to Paolo and the National Portrait Gallery for these three special portraits. C.

Millions of Brits have made taking the tests part of their everyday lives to help prevent the spread of Covid infections. Dr Nathan, a doctor in London, says some people are testing themselves incorrectly and may be inadvertently going out while positive for the virus. He says the three most common mistakes are failing to spot positives, not reading the instructions and mixing up the best way to conduct the test, Manchester Evening News reports. Dr Nathan said: “Any positive line within  minutes, evenit is so faint that it is barely visible, equals a positive result, he said. “However,a faint line appears after  minutes, this can be ignored.” He added: “Don’t forget to avoid eating or drinking for at least  minutes before, to blow your nose and to wash your hands!”  “You should always follow the enclosed instructions, he continued. “If the test advises doing a throat and nose swab, do this. If it advises a nose swab only, do this. “That being said, there are some anecdotal reports of people getting a positive throat swab and a negative nose swab, and later developing symptoms and a positive PCR.”Dr Nathan who shares advice about Covid on his Instagram, @expedition_doctor. It comes as a new rule change is set to come into effect tomorrow, as the government works on keeping on top of coronavirus case numbers.There have been dficulties keeping track of case numbers in recent weeks due to shortages of lateral flow testsand polymerase chain reactiontests.Despite this, case numbers have remained high and have reached record levels since the Omicron iant took a hold on the country.  The UKaposs official Covid death toll passed , on Saturday January . Currently, people who test positive for Covid with no symptoms on a lateral flow test are required to take a PCR to confirm their status. This will change from January . They will still have to isolate for at least seven days, but only from the date of their positive lateral flow test.

Critics condemned the three-month arrangement with  health care firms which is intended to offer cancer surgery and urgent care to NHS truststhey are overwhelmed by Covid cases.Experts, campaigners and trade unions believe the new deal, backed by undisclosed amounts of taxpayers’ cash, will line multinational firms’ pockets and care for very few NHS patients.They say private hospitals can only take on extra patients by poaching medics from the NHS, which needs , more staff.At least  NHS trusts stretched to the limits have declared critical incidents in recent days.  In the first year of the pandemic, NHS England signed contracts worth more than £billion with private hospital firms. Yet they delivered less than .% of the nation’s Covid care and took on fewer NHS patients than the year before, said the Centre for Health and the Public Interest think tank. Campaigner Dr John Lister, of Keep Our NHS Public, said the new deal showed ministers and NHS England had learned nothing from the sums wasted on unused private capacity in . The health policy academic said: “Private hospitals can only take on additional NHS patients by poaching additional staff trained, and employed, by the NHS.” He said: “Tory ministers now prefer to squander more millions on short-term stop-gap deals with profit-seeking private hospitals than invest in reopening the ­thousands of NHS beds.”  Cat Hobbs, of campaign group We Own It, said decades of under funding has stretched the NHS to its limit and this is now an excuse to hand out more private contracts. “Not only does this open the door to further privatisation of our NHS, it’s also a huge waste of public money.” But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the agreement showed the collaboration across our health care services to create an extra safeguard that ensures people can continue to get the care they need.The UK has one of the fewest hospital beds-per-head of ­population of almost any developed nation. NHS England said more than , NHS day cases, almost . million surgical procedures and more than , diagnostic tests were carried out in the private sector in the past year.  The UK recorded , more confirmed Covid cases today and  more deaths.Weekly Covid hospitalisations are up % in the North East but in London, where Omicron first took off, hospital admissions in  are now down about a fth.NHS England chief operating officer Sir David Sloman said the new deal “means as many people as possible can continue to get the care they need”.

There will also be a north-south ide with temperatures hovering around zero and dropping as low as -C on Tuesday morning, while milder temperatures and rain is predicted for the south west of England. Met Office forecaster Alex Deaking said:In Scotland and Northern Ireland there’s a hint of blue on the charts and so certainly in rural areas and hills there will be pockets of frost. Most towns and cities just about staying above but we are in the colder air here further south with the cloud and the rain we are a long way from freezing with town in the south west perhaps staying in double digits.  Monday was a washout for much of the country with plenty of rain but Tuesday should be brighter and then the mercury will drop again in the evening. Temperatures will tumble on Tuesday evening so again that blue hue on the charts suggesting frost before midnight in the Midlands, South Wales and further south will see a frost developing and some fog patches which could be slow to clear on Wednesday, said Mr Deakin. More clouds across the North West and the Highlands but for most Wednesday is a fine winters day with some sparkling sunshine and light winds. Start with a frost but by the afternoon temperatures ticking up to about the average of C or C.  There was a warning though that it could be a lot colderthe fog doesnapost lt. “Butfog sticks then it will be dficult for the temperatures to get much above freezing,” added Mr Deakin.The weather pattern is expected to continue next week with typical frost for the time of the year.  The Met Office stated: A continuation of largely settled conditions is most likely as we head into the middle of January with high pressure remaining in charge across the south of the country. Most areas are set to be dry with any spells of rain and stronger winds likely to be restricted to northern parts of the country. The settled weather will bring widespread overnight frost as well as fog patches, these sometimes freezing. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Blustery showers in west and north Scotland, slowly easing. Rain, drizzle and low cloud across southern areas, where it will be mild. However sunnier skies in central parts of the UK should follow to all but some southern counties later. Tonight: Windy across northern Scotland, with patchy rain and fairly mild. Elsewhere dry, patchy cloud in some central and western parts but clear where with frost and patchy rural fog. Wednesday: Southern and central areas mostly sunny with light winds, after any fog clears, temperatures mostly near average before frost and fog s after dark. Northern Scotland, windy with patchy rain. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Settled but colder in the south with fog and low cloud becoming more widespread and stubborn to clear. Milder further north with rain and stronger winds at first.

Lol thataposs fine as long as theyaposre hot, one said.  Another added: Literally as long as they arenapost cold, tough or soggy [I donapost care]. If that fixes it then Iaposm cool with it. While someone  advised: Always ask for fries with no salt and they will a hundred per cent be fresh! Bring your own salt!

Take care of her for me.” Kevin and Joe’s owner admitted that they were “bawling” making the video, and urged people in their comments to “cherish every single day with your fur baby.”  Thousands of TikTok users were moved by the emotional video, with owners sharing their tragic experiences of losing their own beloved dogs. “I know how much you miss him,” one person commented. “My Maxy, same story and a chocolate [Labrador]. I can think of him now without crying, sometimes.”“Our animals ’ hearts can go on living longer than their bodies,” another said. “I miss all mine watching over me.”Others acknowledged the bittersweet experience of getting a new puppy after losing a dog. “This made me cry so hard,” a third person admitted. “I’m in this same boat. Just got a new baby after losing my previous one back in June.” “We lost our boy in March to lymphoma,” another added. “And he just sent us a new boy who needs extra TLC.” Kevin and Joe aren’t the only dogs who have left TikTok viewers in tears lately. More than three million people were moved by an uplting video of Rottweiler Pluto, which showed how it might look to have your dog greet you in the afterle. Captioned: “You arrive in heaven, this is how your best friend greets you,” the emotional clip shows Pluto bounding through a field towards the camera in slow motion, a happy grin on his face. “I instantly started sobbing watching this and thinking about that day,” one person commented on the tear-jerking video. “Tears in my eyes - I really hope this is true,” another added.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"district news january 7 2022","story":"Tiny Glenbarr Primary School, which has just six pupils, has just missed out on being named Scotland#s most scenic school.More than , votes were cast in a Twitter contest organised by Henry Hepburn, news editor at education resource magazine and website Tes Scotland, to highlight the stunning locations of Scotland#s schools.The competition attracted  schools and celebrities even got involved, re-Tweeting posts to boost votes during the few days of competition in December.Despite having so few students, Glenbarr reached the nail-biting semi-final, just short of the final.With views overlooking Ben Nevis, Lochaber High School won in the end, narrowly beating Morgan Academy in Dundee.MID ARGYLLVolunteers are needed to help provide and expand PCR testing in several locations across the NHS Highland region, including Tarbert and Lochgilphead.Volunteers will be co-ordinated by the British Red Cross.

This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet. There were no incidents of breach of the peace, assaults and so on.All was peaceful on Islay too.No public houses or hotel bars were open to the public on New Year#s Day, which undoubtedly helped to keep everything quiet.There was one New Year#s Day incident. A van belonging to the Redfusion television company struck a wall on Low Askomill. Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

This original fragment is now in the National Museum of Scotland but its discovery suggested something very signicant about Aberlady’s early history.The design on the fragment was similar to the artwork of the Lindisfarne Gospels, an illuminated manuscript made on Holy Island and completed around AD. This Gospel book is a priceless national treasure, probably created by Eadfrith, the Bishop of Lindisfarne.Ian has a passion for history, especially early Medieval history in the time before Scotland, and so the cross fragment had always fascinated him. The dimensions of the cross fragment suggested that, before it was broken, it would have stood about five metres tall.“A large cross with this level of ornate carving would only be commissioned and erected at a place of some importance,” he told me.“The Celtic Church was widening and deepening its influence and its leaders now had the ear of kings. Royal endowments of land and wealth to the Church and rewards to loyal and battle-hardened thanes co-existed. This was very much a time of devout holy men and warlords. It was such an exciting piece of evidence of Aberlady’s early history.”Ian explained that a cross of similar date and style at Abercorn in West Lothian was very probably carved by the same person, or team of masons, and gave an idea of what the rest of the cross at Aberlady might have looked like. Intriguingly, there were three fragments of that cross.When he told me this, my thoughts wandered for a moment. Here we were, having a wee drink in a pub, talking about a craftsman, or group of craftsmen, whose skill and creativity has been preserved for well over a thousand years, and yet we know nothing about them, not even their names. I raised a glass to them and the countless thousands of skilled stonemasons, joiners, builders and artists of all kinds who really did build our historic monuments, but whom history almost never credits.But, I thought, at least we know who made the beautul recreation: Barry Grove, who also carved the reconstruction of the Pictish cross-slab at Hilton of Cadboll – and he used the same simple tools and techniques that would have been used by those earlier stone masons. The cross was unveiled in Aberlady’s Memorial Garden on December , .Ian then told me of the lost ecclesiastical settlement of Pefferham. He explained that there was a medieval document called Historia Regum, meaning History of the Kings. It was written in the th century and is usually credited to Symeon of Durham. This document listed all the main churches of existence in the Northumbrian diocese of St Cuthbert during the ninth and th centuries AD. Aberlady would have been part of this diocese.“Each of the important churches of the diocese, including Melrose, Abercorn, Edinburgh, Auldhame and Tyninghame, are identied in a clockwise direction in the Historia Regum,” Ian explained. “But there is one church mentioned in that document that is lost in time and seems to have vanished from both maps and memories. It was known as Pefferham, seemingly east of Edinburgh and west of Auldhame.”The western branch of the Peffer Burn flows into Aberlady, of course, and place-name evidence places the village on a route taken by monks travelling between the two great seats of learning of the Celtic Church at this time: Iona and Lindisfarne on Holy Island.This route became a holy highway connecting the two major religious sites, and one very likely taken by St Aidan, who left Iona to establish the church on Lindisfarne. In this context, a high cross here at Aberlady, or Pefferhamyou prefer, becomes quite plausible.More evidence emerged from metal finds in the Glebe Field immediately north of the present church. The tip of an ornately carved bishop’s crosier and a carved representation of Madonna and child had been found by metal detectorists lots of coins too. Moreover, geophysical research located two seemingly overlapping oblong structures, which could have been Anglo-Saxon but perhaps over large when compared with others. The evidence was cumulating and convinced Ian of the need for archaeological research. Historic Environment Scotland agreed and Historical Monument Consent was given, and a case for funding was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund.The project envisaged involving six local schools, as well as many local and not-so-local volunteers, and the funding was approved. The archaeological investigation in the Glebe Field, just north of the church, took place in .The results of the dig were astounding, revealing a signicant settlement of stone structures overlaying earlier timber structures dating to the seventh to th centuries. The largest collection of scattered metal objects dating from the Anglo-Saxon period ever discovered in Scotland came from the Glebe here, pointing firmly to a major settlement during that time.Ian happily told me that “prominent academic research experts have agreed that there is now sufficient artefactual, place-name and textual evidence to say that we can begin to tell the story of the ‘lost’ Anglo-Saxon settlement of Pefferham”. “In fact,” he added, “it seems that base hole for the original carved cross may have been discovered.”It was so fascinating to hear and there is not enough space here to go into all the details of the story, but fascinating leaflets have been produced by the conservation and history society which bring these exciting discoveries to le. But nothing compares to a visit to the village to view the locations and feel the presence of all this history, with brilliantly illustrated information and interpretative  by the society to guide your imagination.What has been achieved by Aberlady Conservation and History Society was summed up by Ruth Parsons, chief executive of Historic Environment Scotland, who has said: “The incredible work done by Aberlady Conservation and History Society has brought previously unknown history to light. It has added to our understanding of a period in history little understood, even by those who know most about it… this fabulous cross reconstruction is, quite simply, unique. Hopefully, it will stand for centuries.”I hope so too."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-new-housing-development-tranent-revealed","story":"Members of the public can learn about Persimmon Homes East Scotland’s plans for land between Lammermoor Terrace and the industrial units off Elphinstone Road on Wednesday.The developer is yet to reveal how many new homes or what size the properties would be on the site, which is currently farmland.A spokesperson for Persimmon Homes East Scotland said: “Persimmon Homes will host an online interactive consultation event on Thursday, January , between pm and pm.“Members of the public are invited to post questions on the proposals and a member of our team will be online to answer.”A formal application would need to be submitted to East Lothian Council following the public consultation.Members of the public would be given another chance to look at the plans and make any comment before they are potentially scrutinised by the council’s planning committee.Mike Falconer, chairman of Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council, encouraged any interested parties to attend the virtual consultation and find out more about the proposals.

Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had already called the move to scrap free tests “utterly wrongheaded”.: Warning on free testsPhillips’s running order also included João Vale de Almeida, the EU’s ambassador to the UK, on Northern Ireland and trade the First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, on dferences in Covid restrictions around the UK and Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol, on the Colston statue verdict. It was a newsy mix that made for a lively hour.Sunday Morning had Mr Zahawi and Rachel Reeves, Shadow Chancellor, as well as an interview with a hospital chief executive. In keeping with Marr show tradition there was an arts segment, this one featuring Elizabeth McGovern, aka Cora Crawley of Downton Abbey fame, and her new play about fellow actor, Ava Gardner. The show’s other regular, the newspaper review, had also survived intact, as had the set.Sunday Morning was similar to Marr while at the same time very dferent. Where Marr’s show was fleet of foot and proactive, Sunday Morning had the air of a programme that was put together last Tuesday and not changed since. Where Marr set out to make headlines, Sunday Morning came across asit wanted to have no impact at all.In short, Sunday Morning, like its title, felt safe, bland, BBC.Fair enough, butthe Raworth shows prove popular with audiences, and BBC management, it could influence the selection of the new host.Comparing Marr and Sunday Morning has little to do with the presenters personally. Both are experienced, highly respected journalists. But broadly speaking they represent dferent styles and approaches to the jobRaworth, for example, is BBC through and through, cool, calm, hard to read. In recent years it has seemed as though she was getting ready to take on a Dimbleby role with a place at great state occasions.: Covid, the latest figuresMarr, in contrast, with a hinterland in newspapers before joining the BBC, is more of a scrapper whose interview style could best be described as robust. He left the BBC precisely because he wanted to express a view and shake things up.Which style do viewers prefer  It is a question being asked not just at the BBC but throughout the industry as a whole. GB News thought it had the answer by hiring “big personalities”, only to find viewers cared just as much,not more, about basic standards.

To read Jeremy Dauber’s American Comics: A History is to be reminded that the comic book industry in the United States has been racist, sexist and exploitative pretty much from the get-go.And, of course, it was also hugely successful and re-engineered our collective imaginations too.It even changed the way we talk, it seems. “The comic strip’s influence on American language was profound,” Dauber writes of their impact in the early decades of the century. “Bud Fisher of Mutt and Jeff fame invented piker and the phrases fall guy and got his goat. Tad Dorgan came up with applesauce, ball and chain and cat’s pyjamas, among others. Barney Google contributed heebie-jeebies … And Harold T. Webster’s Timid Soul added a whole new character type to the lexicon – or, at least, named it: one Caspar Milquetoast. Comics even gave the world knock-knock jokes…”The distance between influence and reward is one of the recurring themes of Dauber’s new book. The popularity of the pulps – Walter Brown Gibson, creator of The Shadow could afford to live a triplex off New York’s Central Park while churning out  Shadow novels – prompted kids eager to share in the largesse to sign any contract put in front of them, a pattern that was then repeated in comics too.And so, DC editor Vincent Sullivan bought Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster’s original Superman comic strip for  , the equivalent of in today’s money. “And infor that he also got the rights,” Dauber points out. “To Superman.”The equation was simple. You signed away your rights in order to get published. And, as a result, you missed out on the rewards.First appearing in Action Comics in , Superman was an instant success. Very quickly, Action Comicsand the spin-off comic Superman were selling a million copies an issue .In  Siegel and Shuster sued to regain the rights to Superman and recover m they believed they were due for the character. They were unsuccessful. Shuster was later picked up as a vagrant in Central Park. It was only later in the decade that DC began to acknowledge its debt to the pair.Many other comic writers and artistshad similar experiences.But there are other stories to tell. Like the debt comics owe to William Randolph Hearst, the news baron who inspired Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane. Hearst was actually a fan of comic strips. He enjoyed them and enjoyed the copies of his newspaper they helped sell.He hired Rudolph Dirks to create The Katzenjammer Kids which debuted in  and George Herriman, the man behind Krazy Kat, perhaps the greatest comic strip of all time .Indeed, Hearst loved Krazy Kat so much that he gave Herriman total creative control and a letime contract, even though the strip was never hugely popular.Dauber’s book really picks up the pace when it reaches the s and the hysteria that surrounded comics in the post-war conservatism of Eisenhower’s America. Step forward Dr Frederic Wertham, by far the greatest cartoon villain in the story of American comics.Wertham’s back story, as Dauber points out, is intriguing. A German Jew who emigrated to America in the s, he corresponded with Freud, worked with Clarence Darrow defending black defendants and was praised by Thomas Mann and Arthur Miller. His sincerity in wanting to protect kids was not in doubt.But, by the same token, his distaste for comic books, ultimately spelled out in his book Seduction of the Innocent – a prime text for those studying moral panics – at times verged on hysterical. Speaking to a senatorial committee on juvenile delinquency, he suggested, “I think Hitler was a beginner compared to the comic book industry.”The main victim of the attack on comic books was EC Comics, whose horror and crime publications were both sophisticated in their storytelling strategies but also knew the power of a gruesome image.Dauber, professor of Jewish literature and American studies at Columbia University, a spry, humorous storyteller, has fun with all of this. At one point he plays the game of matching Jack Kirby, and Stan Lee – the men behind Marvel comics – with their Beatle equivalents: “Kirby the Lennonesque genius, pugnacious, spiky, out-there imaginative, of a vaguely mystic bent, matched and complemented by Lee’s McCartneyesque, extroverted Organisation Man genius, keeping the verities and structures moving.”Read More: All of the Marvels by Douglas WolkThere is much more here. Dauber covers the s underground comix scene and its political failings , the Watchmen era, continuity exhaustion. He also charts the emergence of female cartoonists such as Phoebe Gloeckner and Julie Doucet, as well as issues of ethnic and religious ersity in mainstream comicsand such st-century creators as Raina Telgemeier , whom, Dauber believes, “is unmatched at dealing with the often unspoken core of children’s literature: defining yourself as an inidual, and understanding the community of adults, one of which you will become.”At the end, Dauber suggests that the story of American comics is “right in the middle of its run.” If so, this is a very readable map of where it has been.American Comics A History by Jeremy Dauber is published by Norton, £."},{"url":null,"title":"make-queen-pudding","story":"A Right Royal Bake Orf Funnily enough, that is exactly what is has been dubbed by wags theand breadth of the country, and for good reason: the winner will be chosen by none other than Mary Berry, former star of The Great British Bake Off.

It doesn’t matter how much Westminster gives Holyrood – it will never be enough.What the Covid crisis shows is how much better Scotland is as part of the Union rather than separated from the world’s fth largest economy, with no central bank, no currency, no national grid, and with a government that wants to shut down North Sea gas and oil.From the rapid and unique development of the Astra Zeneca vaccine, free from the constraints of the European Medical Agency, through the support of the British Army, the roll-out of millions of free lateral flow tests , to the sharing and pooling of medical science across the four nations, the case for the Union speaks for itself.William Loneskie, Lauder.TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR THE SNPNICOLA Sturgeon’s stance on lateral flow test kits being freely available betrays the core problem with SNP policies: great on the surface, huge problems underneath. Health minister Humza Yousaf is in the same boat .Lateral flow kits are expensive and, like all “free items” on the NHS, prone to abuse. Add in John Swinney’s exhortation to basically use one every time you go out, and not only does the bill rise alarmingly, so does the mountain of plastic waste.Mr Yousaf is not taking into account the damage to commerce nor staff availability nor even the mental health of many Scots.Ms Sturgeon effectively cancelled the holiday period for many and did huge collateral damage to the economy. The SNP is one-dimensional, focussing only on theof time until indyref, but there are three “normal” dimensions plus time and space.The government isn’t coping with the breadth or height of the problems it is facing, and time is running out for the SNP as is space for the endless excuses as to why little is working properly in Scotland today.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THOSE TEST KITS WHILE fully supporting the ongoing current pandemic injection campaign and the regime for frequent use of lateral flow tests, I cannot help but feel a gnawing and growing unease about the veritable mountain of many millions of single-use pieces of plastic we are creating, destined for landfill, this being anathema to the Greens among us.I also wonderany attempt is being made to reclaim and recycle the tonnes of, presumably high-grade stainless steel, from the teeming multitude of used syringe needles David J O’Hara, Scotstoun, Glasgow.THE UK MEDIA’S HARMFUL VIEW OF THE EUDAVID Leask’s article on “Scotland’s skin-deep relationship with the EU”highlights some crucial issues, not least the Scots’ affection but lack of detailed knowledge about the signicance of EU membership.That “we are not remotely interested in its detail” is in part true. That Scots “…do not keep up with what is happening in the EU or in its member states…and neither do our politicians” has been deeply concerning, but no surprise.Why might this be  During our tenure as members of the EU, the UK media largely ignored the wide-ranging signicance of our membership, unless an ‘EU bad’ headline was lazily accessible.I was always struck through my involvement with other member states how their national and, more importantly, regional press regularly featured balanced pieces on a new piece of legislation, new consultation, speeches or visits by Commissioners or delegations.By contrast, it was evident that large sections of the UK press indulged in clear campaigns of misinformation which at times verged on the ludicrous. The EU would fairly regularly send measured rebuttals to editors across the UK, but I cannot recall ever seeing these being published.Sometimes the detail doesn’t matter and sometimes it does. Our collective poor record in informing the public did however play a large part in the dreadful and internationally embarrassing decision to withdraw from the EU, the consequences of which we have not even started to realise, as David Leask observes. Our attachment to Europe is perhaps more at an emotional level and sometimes that is more than enough.Tony Fitzpatrick, Dumfries.A RISK INHERENT IN THE ASSISTED DYING BILLEILEEN McCartinmakes an excellent point about the dangers of the ‘slippery slope’ associated with legalising assisted suicide or euthanasia, as evidenced from the experiences of other countries where laws have been extended to include disabled people, children and those with mental illnesses.She states that many Liberal Democrats oppose Liam McArthur’s proposals but she is incorrect in claiming that “the current Assisted Dying Bill … in no way reflects Lib Dem policy”. Sadly, the Scottish Liberal Democrats did adopt just such a policy in , which was reaffirmed in  by the UK Liberal Democrats in a motion which made specic reference to Mr McArthur’s proposed Bill.Of course, like all previous attempts to legalise assisted suicide, Mr McArthur has failed to address the concerns that exist about how to safeguard those who are vulnerable to pressure being exerted by others with questionable motives, such as access to a potential inheritance or the desire to free up beds in hospitals or care homes.For example, most of those gaining assistance from doctors to commit suicide in Oregon now regularly cite the “fear of being a burden on family, friends or caregivers” as their reason for seeking death.The bill would provide a cheap solution for policy-makers or NHS managers, enabling them to sidestep their obligations to address the unmet need for palliative care. It would make the situation worse.The experience of those countries which have gone down the assisted suicide or euthanasia route shows that the development of palliative care is impeded when such legislation is in place.Faced with shortages of NHS resources, an overstretched workforce due to the pandemic and the prospect of huge savings to be made by enabling patients to end their lives prematurely, can we really trust politicians to come up with a law containing adequate safeguards which will prevent abuses from occurring Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO, Care Not Killing, Glasgow.THE ABORTION CONUNDRUMI HAVE never understood why abortion has not been brought in to the discussion about assisted dying.It is perfectly legal to end a le that has not been lived , whereas people who have lived what they describe as a happy and full le and now wish to end it, either because of, or ahead of, intolerable, unmanageable pain, are unable to make this decision for themselves.Why is it permissible to end one unlived le but not another fully lived le Kathleen Gorrie, Helensburgh.NOT ALL SUFFERING CAN BE RELIEVEDI AM a retired doctor, and a Catholic opposed to assisted dying legislation.Like Lilian McDade , I have watched my -year-old son die. I have witnessed the suffering of patients, of their family and friends, and also within my own family. I don’t believe we can relieve all suffering, either physical or mental.However, I dfer from your previous correspondents. As a doctor, I felt my role was to relieve suffering where I could and to acknowledge and respect the patient and her family when I was unable to provide relief. As a doctor and a person, it was not my role to end her le, only to be present.Some of us have charmed lives and happy deaths, but some have dficult lives and dficult deaths.I believe a caring society acknowledges this and acts to help. Offering death, however, is not acceptable to doctors, nurses or human beings.We ought to oppose assisted dying legislation.Miriam Deeny McKernan, Rutherglen. "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13365327.jpg?type=article-full","title":"royal-mail-release-special-stamps-celebrating-rolling-stones---buy","story":"The band celebrates its th anniversary this year, having been formed in London in  and the  stamps will pay tribute tot the band.Eight of the stamps will feature images from some of their most famous performances over the years, including dates such as ’s London Hyde Park show held on July , just two days after the death of founding member Brian Jones.The free outdoor festival, marketed as The Stones In The Park, saw the live debut of his replacement guitarist, Mick Taylor, who was later replaced by Ronnie Wood.Other performances to feature on the eight stamps include those from Rotterdam, Netherlands, in August  and their gig at the Knebworth Festival in August .A further four stamps will be available in a miniature sheet format and will feature two shots of the band together and two of their vintage worldwide tour posters.The Rolling Stones – Sir Mick Jagger, Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards – worked closely with Royal Mail on the issue of the stamps, which also feature drummer Charlie Watts, who died in August last year.They are only the fourth music group to feature in a dedicated stamp issue, Royal Mail said, following The Beatles in , Pink Floyd in  and Queen in .\" alt\"HeraldScotland: The Rolling Stones are only the fourth music group to feature in a dedicated stamp issue. \" class\"editor-image\"The Rolling Stones are only the fourth music group to feature in a dedicated stamp issue.David Gold, Royal Mail’s director of public affairs and policy, said: “Few bands in the history of rock have managed to carve out a career as rich and expansive as that of the Rolling Stones.“They have created some of modern music’s most iconic and inspirational albums, with ground-breaking live performances to match.”The stamps go on sale from January  and can be ordered from today on the Royal Mail website."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

The rest of the six were Starling, HSBC and the The Co-Operative Bank.The research found that TSB, Bank of Scotland owners Lloyds, , Nationwide, Santander and The Co-operative Bank also all still use SMS texts to very a log in, leaving messages \"at risk of being hijacked by cybercriminals\". Santander and The Co-operative Bank said they are looking to move away from SMS.They also found that TSB, Virgin Money and Nationwide were failing to use software that ensures spoof messages sent by potential scammers are blocked or quarantined by your email provider.

It comes, however, only after millions in public funds have been spent on an ill-conceived vanity project opposed across parties and the communities most directly affected.#No-one disputes the need to modernise air traffic services, which support operations on our leline air routes. Sadly, months and millions have been wasted by SNP Ministers and HIAL on a centralisation that was never going to get off the ground.”Meanwhile, Alistair Carmichael MP said that the “costly and unnecessary” plans have ended “not with a bang but a whimper”, and called for reform of the board of HIAL to ensure the communities that the airport operator serves are heard.“Above all we need to reflect on how this sorry state of affairs came to be in the first place,” said Mr Carmichael.“Retreat on the centralisation plan is only a temporary fix of the underlying problem. HIAL is supposed to be accountable and responsive to the needs of the entire Highlands and Islands and it is clearly not living up to that aspiration.“If we are to avoid another similar fiasco in the future then we need to look at further reform to ensure that our communities are heard on the board of HIAL.”Richard Hardy, Prospect National Secretary, welcomed the announcement and said that the union and HIAL remain in “sensitive negotiations” in relation to the future delivery of air traffic services.A HIAL spokesperson said: “We have been clear that ATMS is the best option to maintain the long-term sustainability of air services for the Highlands and Islands. Nevertheless, we are committed to working with Prospect and our air traffic control colleagues to try and develop a new solution involving compromise by both sides.“We would encourage those with an interest in ensuring the delivery of a safe, resilient, and sustainable air traffic operation for island communities to recognise the delicate nature of these negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue to reach that end.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In training he was doing well in the last couple of days, that’s why he was quite rightly in the starting XI.“I think in the first half we found him quite often, but we also tried to get him into the box.“In the second half that was not that often the case and that’s why at the end of the game I decided to make two changes with Anthony Elanga and Jesse Lingard.Into the next round of the FA Cup ⏭ pic Dqpcte— Bruno FernandesJanuary , “It was very important to progress into the next round. Yesespecially for strikers – it’s important that they score goals on and off, that there are moments of success.“Of course it would be good, for example, for Marcushe could score a goal but as long as he’s trying, as long as he’s training well I don’t see that much of a problem.”Rashford was far from the only below par performer in a match Rangnick took some positives from as United got back to winning ways after last week’s - home loss to Wolves.“We knew from the beginning that it will be a challenging game for us against a very flexible Villa side with their rotations that they’re doing during the game all the time between their full-backs and theireights,” he said.“I think we saw quite a few pros today. I think we were better, we had a better structure. vw,vw,px, px\"Ralf Rangnick’s side progressed to the next round “We also had good energy in the team, we moved the ball, in the first half especially, good within our team, with quite a few good diagonal balls.“That was exactly what we intended to do against their rather central team and that was exactly the way how we created our first goal.“But, as you said quite rightly, we’re still struggling in the centre of the pitch. That’s why Villa also had their moments where they could have scored.”The helter-skelter encounter adds spice to Saturday evening’s rematch in the Premier League at Villa Park.Marquee loan signing Philippe Coutinho could make his debut for Villa, whose manager Gerrard was left ruing what could have been on Monday.“I thought the performance was good for large periods,” the Villa boss said.“I thought we were dominating, we could have scored two or three goals tonight.It wasnt to be, but your support was immense from start to finish.Thank you and well see you back at Villa Park on Saturday. pic ExWGwNTt— Aston VillaJanuary , “I’ve got no complaints with what the players have given or the performance, but we go away frustrated because we’re knocked out of the FA Cup and we look to ourselves as to the reasons why.”Villa scored two goals in the second half through Danny Ings and Ollie Watkins, but both were ruled out.The second was a clear offside call but the first was more unclear to those inside Old Trafford, with Gerrard told it was because Jacob Ramsey impeded Edinson Cavani in the build-up.“The officials took three-and-a-half minutes to settle that one,” Gerrard said. “They have looked at two or three things in it.“When VAR is there and they make a decision you have to accept it. There is nothing you can do to change it.“The easy way out is to blame luck and the officials, we won’t do that.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year. While onboard, Mavis learned to operate every part of the ship, from hoisting and lowering the sails to scrubbing the decks – even learning how to helm and steer the ship.  Brave Mavis also grabbed the chance to climb the ship’s rigging – a height of around .m from the deck.The Jubilee Sailing Trust promotes a unique mission, to give people of mixed abilities and circumstances the freedom to explore their ability, potential and place in the world through inclusive adventures at sea.Alongwith her team – called a “Watch” – Mavis was also in charge of lookout for other vessels or shipping equipment which may affect the course of the ship.There were four Watches over a  hour period, each getting a chance to experience le onboard a tall ship. Watches are made up of people with mixed abilities, mostly first-timers like Mavis, but also those living with a disability.Mavis said: “I went on a voyage on Tenacious and it changed my whole outlook on le. It was the adventure of a letime. I was made to fee part of the team, sailing this magnicent ship, straight away, the permanent crew at our sides – and we couldn’t have done it without them. They guided us in all aspects of the running of the ship with care and kindness.“Watching everyone working together as a team really moved me. I wanted to let everyone know, whether disabled or non-disabled,you’ve lost confidence in le or fearful of being with people, this is where you need to be. Part of the team on Tenacious.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1641394728458.jpg--covid_19___wed_5th_january_figures.jpg?1641394728000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220105newscovid 19 wed 5th january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows three further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

They work best as high volume hubs, when demand is at its peak.“If these big centres suit you best, now is the best time to go - either for a walk-in jab or by making an appointment.“The centres still have a role, but it will be scaled back in a number of locations, as we spread capacity out more widely across Northern Ireland. That will include reduced opening hours and days of operation in some of the big centres.”She added: “Experience tells us that localised clinics are very effective at reaching people who do not come forward straightaway.“Trusts are therefore starting to sht resources towards local and mobile clinics. These will include locations where take-up for boosters has been lower, and also in high footfall settings such as shopping centres.“While there will be more clinics, they will generally only be available at a particular location for a limited period of time.“Localised clinics are also very important in reaching people with accessibility issues and helping to provide equal access to boosters.“If you want to get your booster at a big centre which currently has plenty of available capacity, don’t delay any further.”To get instant information on Trust and pharmacy vaccination clinics closest to you, type in your postcode or town at this online location search https:vaccinations.covid-.hscni.net location-search.Most ReadCrime pays for loyalist killer Robert ‘Brooksy’ Clarke as he puts Co Antrim mansion on market for almost £m‘He was my brother, I loved him so much’: Funeral takes place of ‘beautul soul’ Aidan Mann stabbed in DownpatrickDick Strawbridge: buying dream home in France left us pennilessCouncil chief executive Anne Donaghy takes case against employer alleging sexual, religious and political discriminationDee Coleman’s behind bars bromance with dissident sex attackerTop VideosPlayDownpatrick murder victim Aidan Mann laid to restPlayVideo: World#s most powerful telescope gets shock testing in Northern Ireland \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cffcbcafbaa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cffcbcafbaa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Vigil for murdered tattoo artist Aidan Mann held in BelfastLatest CoronavirusUUP leader slams Jim Allister after Covid query asking what precautions in place to prevent ROI citizens availing of free testing kits from NICoronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and , cases as MLAs meet to discuss ongoing crisis in schoolsMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageChief Medical Officer issues fresh appeal for over-s to get boostedDjokovic row: DUP MLA’s support for tennis star sparks criticismLatestDemand for games consoles boosts Very’s Christmas salesOpera singer Maria Ewing dies aged Christmas jumper proves hit for Lidl as festive sales riseSafety doors failure probed after deadly New York City apartment block fireGhislaine Maxwell’s lawyers argue ‘compelling basis’ for new trial,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Covid cases across the country have continued to rise with , cases reported from December  to January . Of this, over  were in Derry as Derry remains the county with the highest Covid infection rate in Northern Ireland. Schools across the city resumed face to face teaching in the classroom earlier this week after the Christmas break, with no change to Covid guidance. Susan Parlour, President of National Education UnionNI, said: The message seems to be, keep the schools open and hope for the best, its farcical. There is no PPE in schools and there are no risk assessments. I understand this takes time but it is essential in the current circumstances. Face coverings are required in schools which staff need to provide themselves or they need to accept the substandard masks offered which are really not fit for purpose. Also, many children do not wear their masks and this is rarely challenged. We receive daily figures on Covid cases in schools but with no track and trace in place and lateral flow testing, which has proved time and time again to not be the most reliable, the number of cases and close contacts will be higher than what is recorded. Chief Medical Officer, Dr McBride, stated that Covid was not spreading in schools and that outside socialising was the cause, we saw the rise in cases over Christmas and the schools were shut. Mark Browne, Permanent Secretary, sent a letter to principals on December  that stated that the departments advice onmeasures to reduce transmission has not changed. He stated that EA has provided CO monitors to schools along with detailed instructions on their use. This is not the case. CO monitors are not on the ground and there is little to no guidance on how to use them. NEU NI released a statement providing guidance for CO monitors and their use stating that carbon dioxide monitors are not a solution to the problem of poor ventilation. The Department for Education in Englandis rolling out a very limited number of CO units and most schools will not be able to benefit from this scheme. Susan continued: Schools, students and principals feel let down and there are no mitigations in place to keep them safe. There seems to be a  perception that teachers want to teach from home, it is not the case. Teachers want to be in the classroom but they want it to be safe for both them and their students. There are no measures in place to keep the school community safe, no close contacts, no track and trace, no support and no meaningful guidance. NEU NI are currently advising teachers and schools not to teachover  per cent of their staff are absent. If this number of absent staff members is reached, the school should close. The Education Minister stated that options are available such as consolidating classes or teachers teaching remotely as well as live teaching but Susan explained, this is even more work and pressure on teachers, in an already stressful teaching environment. At St Cecelias College in Derry, % of the staff are currently off sick six teachers and  classroom assistants. There are  pupils who are off sick in one class alone. Tanya Wakeley, teacher and union rep at St CeceliasCollege in Derry, said: We are teaching in a Covid stew, it is a nightmare and it is not good enough. Those are the numbers only two days into the school year and we havent even reached the peak of this Omicron wave. The government has to do something and we need to speak up. We dont want to work from home, its not an efficient way to teach and its double the workload. We want to be in the classroom to teach our pupils, but we want to be doing it safely, where both staff and pupils feel safe. We know for a fact that schools arent safe at the minute and we can see that after only two days back teaching. The students feel let down too, especially the senior years. They dont even knowtheyll be sitting their exams in the summer. Nobody knows what is going on and there is no clear direction. I have students that have never sat an official exam and that will no doubt never get their work experience. We feel very in the dark with everything and we are not being told enough. With teacher absences, many teachers are forced to form compositeclasses or teach larger numbers of pupils than they are used to or is usually advised. Tanya continued: A class can have anything between  to  pupils and what we have to do at the minute, because we dont have enough teachers in school, is put more than one class in the multi-purpose hall. The pupils are all socially distanced, but Covid is airborne, and there are no windows in that hall. If we are in the classroom, the classrooms are freezing because we have to ventilate the rooms, its the middle of January, with the cold air we are going to get sick either way, whether its Covid or not. We are not provided with sufficient PPE, the masks are not fit for purposeand at this stage, it is a complete trust situation that pupils do not come inthey have tested positive or have Covid symptoms. The parents are worried as well and we dont even have the governments guidance to reassure them. We are being told one thing by the government and another thing by experts. You dont know what to believe and God knows what is coming next. This is not going away and its definitely not going away in schools. It is going to get worse before it gets better and we need plans in place. We are collateral damage and we have been forgotten about. Education Minister, Michelle McIlveen, has said her priority remains keeping schools open amid the surge of casesin Northern Ireland. She said there have been no changes to the guidance issued toschools regarding Covid because health officials havent changed their position. Schools experiencing staffing shortages will have the option to move to remote learning and introduce partial timetables, she added. A spokesperson for the Department of Educationsaid that “a range of mitigations” have been recommended to risk the transmission of Covid within schools across the North. They said: “Throughout the pandemic the Department has worked closely with key stakeholders as well as the Department of Health and Public Health Agency as we manage our response and continue to do so. “We continue to follow advice in relation to all public health issues including contact tracing however no changes have been recommended in respect of the approach to contact tracing or changes to the DE Covid guidance. “Rates of Covid infection in the community in Northern Ireland are currently extremely high. Schools are part of our community so it is inevitable that there will be cases among staff and students in our schools. “While we cannot eradicate Covid altogether, a range of mitigations are recommended to reduce the risk of transmission as much as possible in the school environment. “These measures include regular LFD testing, good hand respiratory hygiene, maximising ventilation, face coverings for post-primary pupils and staff and consistent groups wherever possible. “All staff and those aged  and over have also had access to the vaccination programme. We have a shared objective to support our schools so they are able to provide for our children as we all know that the best place for our children and young people is in school. “No one mitigation on its own will prevent the spread of the virus, but used together each mitigation provides works to reduce transmission. “Our schools, like those across the rest of the UK and Ireland, are facing staffing shortages due to the pandemic. There is a limited supply of qualied teachers. “We have made a formal call for retired teachers to provide support and we have also looked to provide more flexibility for schools in how they deploy substitute teachers. If further financial resources are needed by schools we will make bids to meet these costs. “The EA secured more than , C monitors and approximately  per cent of schools in NI have now been provided with monitors, with a further  monitors expected imminently. The additional monitors will be delivered to the remaining schools as a priority and also to those schools that have requested additional monitors. “Good ventilation, along with other measures can help mitigate the risk of transmission. Natural ventilation, such as opening windows can be effective at reducing the risk from virus in the air. “School leaders who are concerned about ventilation in a room should contact the EA maintenance helpline for advice and support on the best approach for their inidual circumstances. “In some cases where an area of poor ventilation has been identied, it may be appropriate to consider the use of an air cleaning unit as an additional mitigation whilst further remedial work is undertaken to improve ventilation. “The pandemic requires a collective response to support the safe operation of our schools – staff, parents, and pupils all have a key role to play carrying out regular testing and making sure making sure that anyone with symptoms follows Covid- advice and information which is available atNIDirect.gov.uk.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Covid cases across the country have continued to rise with , cases reported from December  to January . Of this, over  were in Derry as Derry remains the county with the highest Covid infection rate in Northern Ireland. Schools across the city resumed face to face teaching in the classroom earlier this week after the Christmas break, with no change to Covid guidance. Susan Parlour, President of National Education UnionNI, said: The message seems to be, keep the schools open and hope for the best, its farcical. There is no PPE in schools and there are no risk assessments. I understand this takes time but it is essential in the current circumstances. Face coverings are required in schools which staff need to provide themselves or they need to accept the substandard masks offered which are really not fit for purpose. Also, many children do not wear their masks and this is rarely challenged. We receive daily figures on Covid cases in schools but with no track and trace in place and lateral flow testing, which has proved time and time again to not be the most reliable, the number of cases and close contacts will be higher than what is recorded. Chief Medical Officer, Dr McBride, stated that Covid was not spreading in schools and that outside socialising was the cause, we saw the rise in cases over Christmas and the schools were shut. Mark Browne, Permanent Secretary, sent a letter to principals on December  that stated that the departments advice onmeasures to reduce transmission has not changed. He stated that EA has provided CO monitors to schools along with detailed instructions on their use. This is not the case. CO monitors are not on the ground and there is little to no guidance on how to use them. NEU NI released a statement providing guidance for CO monitors and their use stating that carbon dioxide monitors are not a solution to the problem of poor ventilation. The Department for Education in Englandis rolling out a very limited number of CO units and most schools will not be able to benefit from this scheme. Susan continued: Schools, students and principals feel let down and there are no mitigations in place to keep them safe. There seems to be a  perception that teachers want to teach from home, it is not the case. Teachers want to be in the classroom but they want it to be safe for both them and their students. There are no measures in place to keep the school community safe, no close contacts, no track and trace, no support and no meaningful guidance. NEU NI are currently advising teachers and schools not to teachover  per cent of their staff are absent. If this number of absent staff members is reached, the school should close. The Education Minister stated that options are available such as consolidating classes or teachers teaching remotely as well as live teaching but Susan explained, this is even more work and pressure on teachers, in an already stressful teaching environment. At St Cecelias College in Derry, % of the staff are currently off sick six teachers and  classroom assistants. There are  pupils who are off sick in one class alone. Tanya Wakeley, teacher and union rep at St CeceliasCollege in Derry, said: We are teaching in a Covid stew, it is a nightmare and it is not good enough. Those are the numbers only two days into the school year and we havent even reached the peak of this Omicron wave. The government has to do something and we need to speak up. We dont want to work from home, its not an efficient way to teach and its double the workload. We want to be in the classroom to teach our pupils, but we want to be doing it safely, where both staff and pupils feel safe. We know for a fact that schools arent safe at the minute and we can see that after only two days back teaching. The students feel let down too, especially the senior years. They dont even knowtheyll be sitting their exams in the summer. Nobody knows what is going on and there is no clear direction. I have students that have never sat an official exam and that will no doubt never get their work experience. We feel very in the dark with everything and we are not being told enough. With teacher absences, many teachers are forced to form compositeclasses or teach larger numbers of pupils than they are used to or is usually advised. Tanya continued: A class can have anything between  to  pupils and what we have to do at the minute, because we dont have enough teachers in school, is put more than one class in the multi-purpose hall. The pupils are all socially distanced, but Covid is airborne, and there are no windows in that hall. If we are in the classroom, the classrooms are freezing because we have to ventilate the rooms, its the middle of January, with the cold air we are going to get sick either way, whether its Covid or not. We are not provided with sufficient PPE, the masks are not fit for purposeand at this stage, it is a complete trust situation that pupils do not come inthey have tested positive or have Covid symptoms. The parents are worried as well and we dont even have the governments guidance to reassure them. We are being told one thing by the government and another thing by experts. You dont know what to believe and God knows what is coming next. This is not going away and its definitely not going away in schools. It is going to get worse before it gets better and we need plans in place. We are collateral damage and we have been forgotten about. Education Minister, Michelle McIlveen, has said her priority remains keeping schools open amid the surge of casesin Northern Ireland. She said there have been no changes to the guidance issued toschools regarding Covid because health officials havent changed their position. Schools experiencing staffing shortages will have the option to move to remote learning and introduce partial timetables, she added. A spokesperson for the Department of Educationsaid that “a range of mitigations” have been recommended to risk the transmission of Covid within schools across the North. They said: “Throughout the pandemic the Department has worked closely with key stakeholders as well as the Department of Health and Public Health Agency as we manage our response and continue to do so. “We continue to follow advice in relation to all public health issues including contact tracing however no changes have been recommended in respect of the approach to contact tracing or changes to the DE Covid guidance. “Rates of Covid infection in the community in Northern Ireland are currently extremely high. Schools are part of our community so it is inevitable that there will be cases among staff and students in our schools. “While we cannot eradicate Covid altogether, a range of mitigations are recommended to reduce the risk of transmission as much as possible in the school environment. “These measures include regular LFD testing, good hand respiratory hygiene, maximising ventilation, face coverings for post-primary pupils and staff and consistent groups wherever possible. “All staff and those aged  and over have also had access to the vaccination programme. We have a shared objective to support our schools so they are able to provide for our children as we all know that the best place for our children and young people is in school. “No one mitigation on its own will prevent the spread of the virus, but used together each mitigation provides works to reduce transmission. “Our schools, like those across the rest of the UK and Ireland, are facing staffing shortages due to the pandemic. There is a limited supply of qualied teachers. “We have made a formal call for retired teachers to provide support and we have also looked to provide more flexibility for schools in how they deploy substitute teachers. If further financial resources are needed by schools we will make bids to meet these costs. “The EA secured more than , C monitors and approximately  per cent of schools in NI have now been provided with monitors, with a further  monitors expected imminently. The additional monitors will be delivered to the remaining schools as a priority and also to those schools that have requested additional monitors. “Good ventilation, along with other measures can help mitigate the risk of transmission. Natural ventilation, such as opening windows can be effective at reducing the risk from virus in the air. “School leaders who are concerned about ventilation in a room should contact the EA maintenance helpline for advice and support on the best approach for their inidual circumstances. “In some cases where an area of poor ventilation has been identied, it may be appropriate to consider the use of an air cleaning unit as an additional mitigation whilst further remedial work is undertaken to improve ventilation. “The pandemic requires a collective response to support the safe operation of our schools – staff, parents, and pupils all have a key role to play carrying out regular testing and making sure making sure that anyone with symptoms follows Covid- advice and information which is available atNIDirect.gov.uk.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Hundreds of people turned out for the first day of vaccinations at the Centre, which played an important role in the initial drive to deliver First and Second vaccinations. The Foyle Arena is now open to walk-ins and bookings from am to pm, Monday to Saturday, and am to pm on Sundays. Mayor Warke joined them to receive his booster jab, and said he was impressed by the swt organisation of the effort and the professionalism of staff on site. He said: “This is a rapidly changing situation and I am extremely impressed at how these measures have been so quickly put in place to meet demand. I want to acknowledge the work of the Western Trust staff who are doing such an amazing job in very challenging circumstances. “I also want to thank all the staff at the Foyle Arena, and previously at Templemore, who are playing a vital role in this effort. “The Trust are aiming to vaccinate  people a day at the Foyle and I would appeal to everyone attending to please follow the advice of the professionals and lets do all we can to get as many people as possible protected in the weeks ahead.” The campaign is expected to continue until January and to safely accommodate the numbers of visitors to the centre Members of Foyle Arena, there will be some minor impacts to services over the coming weeks, though most will continue as normal. This includes changes to studio class timetables, and alternative temporary arrangements are now in place for Members, with a wide range of leisure services also available across other Council owned leisure Centres. Director of Health and Community with Council, Karen McFarland added: “There has been a speedy response to the recent developments in the Covid pandemic, and we were happy to be able to step up once again to provide much needed facilities to help progress the Trusts Vaccination Campaign. “Measures have been put in place to mitigate any impacts and while most of our leisure services will continue as normal, there may be some disruption to some activities which we will communicate directly to our members. “This is a short term campaign, and I really appreciate everyones patience as we assist in getting vaccinations to those who need them. “With high volumes of people expected to attend I would appeal to people to please follow the guidance at the centre and the directions of staff – they are there to help keep things running smoothly. “The safety of our staff and the public is our first priority and I would ask for everyones cooperation over the coming weeks.” With the volume of people accessing the Foyle Arena, additional parking is available for members at Clooney Park West playing fields. To find out more about leisure services available across all Council sites, and any changes to timetables please go to: derrystrabaneleisure The Western Trust this week issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. People are being encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Vaccinations are also available from GP surgeries and local pharmacists. Over s who have yet to get their first dose of the vaccination can also receive it at the vaccination centres.

These proposals are being brought forward by a new partnership between Derry-based property developer South Bank Square and housing provider Choice. The new plans include a mix of social and affordable homes ranging from one to four bedrooms, comprising a mix of terrace, detached and semi-detached houses as well as a number of bungalows and apartments aimed at those aged  and over. Proposals also include signicant areas of open space, a woodland walk, allotments, childrens play area, and a tenant hub. The project represents poundmillion of investment to the City Region, and will see the creation of approximately  new jobs over a period of eight to  years. Martin Mallon, Managing Director of South Bank Square said: “We are delighted to unveil these updated proposals for the Ballyoan site. “This new partnership with Choice Housing Association represents a signicant multi-million pound investment in the North West and will see the development of hundreds of new family homes over the next ten years. “The comprehensive planned development of this site will be key to delivering some of the thousands of new family homes that we know are very much needed in the city now and over the forthcoming years. “The new proposals will include expansive areas of open space, children’s play areas, a woodland walk, as well as proposed improvements to the local roads infrastructure. “It is fantastic to be able to announce this level of investment in our home city and we expect that this scale of investment will bring with it many job opportunities for local people and local suppliers in the North West. “Enabling works have already started on site following our planning approvals granted earlier this year and we hope to commence house building on site early in .” Michael McDonnell, CEO at Choice added: “We are thrilled to move forward with these proposals in partnership with South Bank Square. This project will unlock huge potential to create much needed, high quality social and affordable homes for a range of people in the city. “As well as relieving housing stress in the city, this project will allow young families to get on the property ladder by bringing forward a number of affordable homes, as well as offering professionally managed, exceptional private rental opportunities too. “Extensive planning has been carried out to ensure the needs of young families, disabled people, and the elderly are catered for, with plenty of green space, allotments, a play park and a tenant hub included in our ambitious plans. “We hope to be able to secure planning permission for these homes so that we can begin to deliver them as soon as possible.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Invest NI and the Department for the Economy , believe that Northern Ireland’s ranking in the ONS survey is not truly reflective of the level of innovation activity that is actually being delivered across the region. This could be down to the fact that many businesses simply don’t recognise what they do as innovation.  In response to the ONS, DfE launched Innovate NI in October  this is an initiative that supports local businesses to progress through a four-step innovation framework for successful innovation to create value. The initiative also provides official recognition for innovation activity, helping businesses to understand where they are in their innovation journey and recognise their innovation achievement.  As a business further develops their innovative project, they can have their activities assessed by Innovate NI. If deemed to be innovative, they receive recognition so they can clearly see the level of progress that theyre making.  Mary agrees with the need to encourage businesses to identy as innovative.  “One thing is for sure we don’t shout about our innovation achievements enough. I firmly believe the NI economy is much more innovative than the ONS survey portrays during the pandemic, we found that NI actually had a lot of innovative businesses with erse offerings and locally we showed a high level of resilience in dealing with a very signicant economic shock. “But I do think micro-businesses in particular, sometimes struggle to see themselves as being innovative and struggle to understand all the supports that are available to them. That’s why Innovate NI’s recognition scheme is so important and it is one of the reasons we decided to support the work of Innovate NI with the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant.” Economic Recovery Innovation Grant The Economic Recovery Innovation Grantis funded by the Department for the Economy’s Economic Recovery Action Plan. The grant was launched on th November and it provides small-to-medium-sized businesses, including micro- businesseswith the opportunity to apply for a grant of up to pound,.  This grant was created to help businesses progress their innovative idea - this idea must be new to the business, or the market, for example, a new product or service, or a new process within the business. The grant will help a business that is currently working on an innovative project to test and develop it, with the end goal of commercialising the product or service, or implementing the process fully in the business. The pound, can be used to fund development costs and the actual implementation of that innovative idea into the business. Businesses hoping to apply must complete Invest NI’s eligibility checker and satisfy the scheme’s eligibility criteria including being registered with HMRC and being a Northern Ireland-based SME or social enterprise.  They must also have a valid Silver Level Innovator recognition from Innovate NI. Silver Level Innovator recognition means businesses have already started to test and develop an innovative idea for their business.  Businesses can checkthey satisfy the eligibility criteria on Investni andthey do, they can submit an innovation assessment to find out their innovation level. Once issued, Invest NI will invite the eligible, Silver Level Innovator to apply for ERIG. Mary says the reason why businesses must have the Silver Level Innovator recognition to qualy for the grant, is to ensure that the grant is put to good use.  “We want local businesses to further develop innovative projects, services or processes that will enable them to grow. A business that is recognised as Silver Level has already completed the ideation and selection steps of the Innovation Framework, so we know the grant will be used to progress an idea Innovate NI has assessed as potentially innovative. “Using the grant to achieve commercialisation or implementation would then, hopefully, allow a business to progress to Gold Level Innovator status.” Innovate NI also provides help, support and signposting to ensure businesses progress through these innovation levels. This helps to avoid repeating the same step over and over again. This signposting will also help businesses know where to go for the right help. “Innovation can be something big or something minor, but it can make a major change for an SME or micro business. Just go checkyou are eligible and where you are on the Innovation Framework - it could completely change the way you do business.” The closing date to apply for the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant is pm on Monday, st January . Grants will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.   Figures from the Department of Health of positive Covid- cases in the North of Ireland.  “The rates at this moment are just phenomenal. You always worry about older, vulnerable people getting infected – certainly in Derry in the last week, weve seen more than five hundred patients in Derry and Strabane over sixty years old becoming infected. Across Northern Ireland that figure is more than three thousand. “Your worry from that is do those elderly and vulnerable patients end up in hospital  So far, our numbers for hospitalisations have only increased to around ten per cent in the last week or so. But we will be watching it very closely because although the Omicron iant is clearly a milder disease for younger people, we dont know yet how it will affect the elderly. “With Omicron, the factor here is how infectious is it. I think thats the major reason weve seen such a big increase. As throughout the pandemic, every time we think were successful, we become complacent and loosen up and complacency always leads to failure. “There was something about us being too complacent before Christmas in terms of bringing in enough restrictions early enough. That to some extent is the problem with a democracy. Politicians want to react to public sentiment rather than anticipate public sentiment. “You see in China, they closed down a million-person cityafter they get three positive results. WhereasBoris Johnson seems to be quite content to tolerate hundreds of thousands of infections per day because he thinks thats what the public seems to be wanting to tolerate. “Its a strange dichotomy in terms of how democracies respond to these pandemics.” The Health Service has been under considerable strain ever since the pandemic began almost two years ago. And Dr Black warns that the strain both the virus and the extra workloads it has brought upon the medical sector may well affect important services being delivered by the Health Serivice. He continued: “We worry about how the virus will affect iniduals in terms of their own health but also the effect that is happening on the Health Service with respect to the ability of staff to attend work. “The BMA mapping before Christmas suggested ten per cent of staff to be off with illness and a further ten to fteen per cent off due to isolation. Unfortunately, we seem to have been proven to have been correct. “Were seeing signicant numbers of staff missing – not just in general practice but in hospitals with nurses, doctors, paramedics and particularly in the ambulance service as well with response times from ambulances longer than we would want. “I see some of the ambulance services in the north of England were saying thatyou had a heart-attack, dont wait for an ambulance – go directly and get a lt to hospital. “Thats an extraordinary situation that were in that the virus is limiting the services for patients in other areas such as heart-attacks and strokes.” Meanwhile, the Western Trust has said it will continue with the temporary suspension of visitors to patients in hospitals, such as Altnagelvin in Derry. A short statement on the Western Trusts website read: “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation in relation to the recent changes to our visiting arrangements. Your support helps us to provide safer care for your relatives and friends who are currently in hospital. “Due to the continued pressures on our hospitals and the high level of COVID- transmission in the community, visiting remains suspended across our hospital sites and facilities. This does not apply to birthing partners, for maternity arrangements.” The Foyle Arena is serving as a mass vaccination centre. It is open between am to pm except on Friday, January  where it is open until pm. The centre is closed on Saturday, January  and Tuesday, January . Its opening hours on Wednesday, January  are pm to pm. The Shantallow Community Centre will be offering vaccinations on Tuesday, January  between pm to pm.

She argues that the new accommodation for the incoming undergraduates would be of immense benefit to the retail and hospitality sectors of Derrystudents were resident close to the citys heart. The student pound could help to kickstart the local economy – more so given the effects the pandemic has had on Derrys businesses. In the letter, Ms McLaughlin writes: “Our city will benefit substantially from the intake of new students. That benefit will increase even furtherthe new accommodation needed for them is located in or close to the city centre. “More specically,students live between campus and city centre this will have signicant positive impact on the commercial heart of the city, through its retail and hospitality sectors. I need hardly remind you of the hard times they have suffered over the last two years. “It is essential that core institutions such as the university work together with the public and private sectors, in order to maximise the combined impact. “I suggest this would in this instance be best achieve by providing student accommodation where it will have the most economic impact, which would be close of Derrys city centre. “Moreover, this would provide the best student experience by giving students easier access to the benefits of urban le, with close proximity to retail facilities and evening activities.” Explaining why she has taken it upon herself to write to Ulster University, Ms McLaughlin added: “I am urging the Ulster University Vice Chancellor, its Council and Senate to consider the potential benefits of their actions to the wider city. Our retail and hospitality sectors have suffered terribly through the pandemic, and locating new student accommodation close to the city centre would provide a real and much needed boost to our commercial sectors. “This, in turn, would help to safeguard existing jobs, as well as creating new jobs. I hope Ulster University will accept the logic of my argument. “While my party and I have campaigned for years for the expansion of Magee on the basis of the skills that will be created that will benefit the city and so will create well paid jobs, it is also very important that the expansion provides wider economic benefits through higher spending in the city and on local businesses. That, too, will create more jobs.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

However, Mr Eastwood stated Ms Truss threat was another in a series of hollow statements from British Government Ministers who the DUP had taken at their word only to be let down on matters Brexit. The Foyle MP said that meetings with senior Tories and threats to trigger Article  are like groundhog day for people in Northern Ireland who want political leaders focused on our crumbling health service, the crisis in our schools and the spiraling cost of living. He said: “It really is incredible that with our health service under immense strain, our schools facing a Covid crisis and households across the North facing spiraling energy costs that the DUP has refused to abandon it’s disastrous campaign of threatening the institutions of government over the Northern Ireland Protocol. “Instead of addressing the real priorities that people are concerned about – getting the surgery they need, protecting jobs in their communities, providing a warm home for their family – the DUP is once again chasing influence with Tories at Westminster who will use them when it’s convenient and then dump them just as quickly. “They haven’t learned a thing from their last ugly break up with that party. “It is like groundhog day for people in Northern Ireland who want political leaders focused on the urgent priorities facing us. “The only outcome to Jeffrey Donaldson’s foolish crusade is more uncertainty and chaos at a time when we just can’t afford it. “Parties that are serious about government should be seeking to work together to improve the lives of people in our communities. “Instead we have establishment parties in a toxic race to see who can bring the government down first to meet their own selfish needs. People are sick of it.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view. If you’re stopped by police with a heavily cracked windscreen, it could lead to penalty points and a fine.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

We’re encouraged to make these ongoing health measures as much a part of the holiday as mulled wine and mince pies. Such steps can help protect our nearest and dearest while we’re together. The gt of protecting one another from COVID- – including the Omicron iant – is the one that truly keeps on giving. The weather outside may be “frightful” but, gathering indoors, we can still open windows to allow fresh air to disperse the virus. Embrace face coverings, there are seasonal styles aplenty to add festive flair to commuting and high street shopping trips. Every adult in the country needs to get a COVID- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk covidvaccination. Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the new Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before because Omicron COVID- is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a COVID- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. And, swter than shaving or applying makeup, taking rapid lateral flow tests are a quick and easy part of your getting ready routine before venturing out. If you have been in contact with someone with COVID- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that dayyou test negative. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for  daysyou are a contact of someone with COVID-. Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-, so keep it on. A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year, celebrate safely and let’s make it a good one. ‘It’s vital to ventilate’  Leeds University Professor of Environmental Engineering Catherine Noakes, pictured, said: “As Christmas is coming people will naturally be spending more time indoors – welcoming friends and family into their home and attending social events together – as the weather gets colder.While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it’s important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home even when people are vaccinated.“In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especiallythere is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air.“That’s why it’s so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, evenjust regularly for a short time. This way fresh air can disperse and blow COVID- particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.”  Wish List  Vaccinations  All adults now need to get a booster vaccine, as two doses do not offer enough protection against the fast spreading Omicron iant. Boosters are available  weeks after second jabs. Get Boosted Now at nhs.uk covidvaccination to signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.  Taking tests  Make taking rapid lateral flow tests part of your festive preparations. Use any unused stocks of rapid lateral flow tests that you may have at homeCollect from your School Universityyou already obtain test kits from thereCollect from your local PharmacyCollect from your local Community Test sitesOrder online at gov.uk   Fresh air  Opening doors and windows for ten minutes can help you and your loved ones stay safe.

McGuigan did not concede a single goal until Desertmartins Ulster semi final defeat to eventual champions Denn of Cavan, and his kick outs provided ample opportunity for the young side in front of him to get at the opposition. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Thompsons pace and running ability saw him constantly encouraged to drive forward from his corner back position into the Dolans attack. He was particularly strong as his side regrouped in the semi final to overturn Moneymores lead, streaming forward at the encouragement of his team-mates to cause the opposition defence a number of problems. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Monaghan is another of the new breed of corner back who is equally comfortable joining in his sides attacks, along with numerous other defenders. The corner back is more than adept at the less glamorous nature of the position too, tenacious in the tackle, intense in his press and has the controlled aggression required to unsettle opposition attackers. Pic by Seamus McQuillan Mono Pix.  An old-school, sticky corner back, Walker was superb as Moneymore defeated Drum in the quarter final, and kept tabs on Dolans Kevin Nixon for much of the semi final. Walker was strong too in the quarter final win over Drum, producing some fine blocks and interventions to showcase his technical defending ability. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Hitting - in their semi final win over Craigbane, McElhennon has sickened defenders all year from deep. He also netted in their Ulster win over Donagh, and has shown a knack for attacking from deep with the poise and devastation of a heat-seeking missile. A key cog in Desertmartins running machine and a large part of their success this season. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Prone to a solo burst into the opposition half, he was particularly good against Drum, drawing an early save from their goalkeeper. Adept at sitting deep and playing the pivot as the men in front of him probe for a defensive opening, Moran has the game intelligence to know when to join the attack to create the overload and give the best opportunity for a score. Pic by Mary K Burke.  At the other side, Desertmartin had a mirror image of McElhennon in McEldowney, who was able to apply pressure on the opposite flank as St Martins hit teams with their speedy runners. Thrived in the space afforded to Desertmartin in their Ulster win over Donagh, and was a strong presence in their semi final defeat to Denn as well. Pic by Tom Heaney nwpresspics.  With his midfield partner Oran Kelly popping up in attacking positions, McGovern was the organiser, sitting back into the hole and looking for the opportunity to hurt the opposition. A calm head during the  final in June, he helped pave the way for that breakthrough success, using all his experience to see his side through a tough patch.  McGinleys experience and physical presence around the midfield area was a big boost for Dolans as they made their first JFC final since . An experienced head in the middle, he helped orchestrate their come-from-behind semi final win over Moneymore in Ballinascreen, and was a vocal organiser to have at centre field as he drove his team into the final. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  CDP Team of the Year : Hurling  See who has made our Team of the Year for last years hurling season.    Torturer-in-chief of a weary Moneymore defence in the semi final, McCosker hit two points and was named man of the match. His ball-carrying ability was key to that turnaround against Henry Joy McCrackens, not only resulting in his own scores, but yielding a number of frees for corner forward Odhran McKane to convert. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  McGuckin was a key link man in the St Martins side, choosing the correct option consistently and helping to probe opposition defences. Another experienced head to guide the younger players around him, the half forwards relentless movement helped create openings for the men around him, while he chipped in with crucial score of his own. Pic by Mary K Burke.  A threat all season, there was an excitement among the Moneymore side when Crozier received the ball. Comfortable running at defenders, he was a threat throughout their junior championship campaign, and was key in helping his side open up a lead in the semi final before a determined Sean Dolans side reeled them in. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Bloomer hit - against Sean Dolans in the semi final and - in a man of the match display against Drum in the quarter final. Showing a dogged determination to threaten the goal, he turned down marks on two occasions, opting to put the head down and go for the net. Both decisions resulted in a collective - as Bloomer showed a ruthlessness in front of the posts. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Murrays breakthrough season has seen him torment opposition defences with ceaseless energy and clinical finishing. His free-taking has also been a feature, and the precocious forward has been rewarded for a fine debut season at adult level with a call-up to Rory Gallaghers provisional Derry squad for the upcoming McKenna Cup. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Had a slow start in the semi final win over Moneymore, but was clinical in the pressure of the closing stages, finishing the game with four points. His free-taking, while errant in the early stages, was slick and composed when it mattered, with the game in the proverbial melting pot as his side chased down and overturned the Moneymore lead.

The St Oliver Plunketts stopper went through the entire championship campaign without conceding a single goal, and his efficiency from kick outs helped his side to reach back-to-back intermediate finals. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Quinn organised the Greenlough defence that was narrowly beaten in a low-scoring county final, and was a tough competitor throughout. A consistent performer, he was comfortable bringing the ball out from the back and supporting his team-mates in attack. Quinn has a seemingly indefatigable engine, and a willingness to give everything to his teams cause. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Lindsay had a fine season at the back for the county champions, and presided over a defence that was not only organised, but ready to break at pace. Tasked with curbing some of the countys more lively attackers, Lindsay produced a consistent level of performance that laid the foundations for his sides Derry success, as well as the run to the Ulster final that followed. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Flitting between corner back and half back, the versatile Steelstown man was tasked with picking up Enda Lynn in the latter stages of the county final as Neil Forester pushed on, and did a fine job until the Greenlough man was forced off through injury late on. Energetic and determined, Baker has all the attributes required to be a successful defender. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Rafferty was a lively member of the Drumsurn half back line that was the fulcrum of so many of their attacks during the championship. His input was vital in the deciding league victory over Banagher, and the has had a fine season as St Matthews reasserted themselves as a force to be reckoned with during manager Sean Bradys maiden year at the helm. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Concannons pedigree and ability was crucial to Steelstowns run through the county championship and on to an Ulster final. His pace, anticipation and fitness at the heart of the Brian Oacutegs defence have been consistent over the last few seasons as they fought to make the breakthrough, and proved crucial in finally getting them over the line. Pic by Mary K Burke.  A strong runner, Kearney drove Greenlough on as they attempted to win successive intermediate championship titles. Particularly adept at winning turnovers as the opposition ran out of room in the Greenlough half back line, he was a key part of a defence that did not yield a single goal in championship football all year. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Devine was an attacking threat for Brian Oacutegs from midfield, and showed great leadership throughout their championship campaign. His experience shone through in a side that blended the seasoned and the youtful with fantastic results. Devine drove Steelstown on throughout their Ulster campaign, particularly good in their win over Donaghmoyne. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Following the injury to Niall Bradley, McCallion was asked to take on a lot of the heavy lting in the Greenlough midfield and performed admirably throughout the season. A huge presence physically, McCallions ability to win ball, both first and second, was key to his sides dominance of opposition teams during their championship campaign. Pic by Mary K Burke.  CDP Team of the Year : Junior football  Who has made the cut for the junior football final XV     McCarron has shown all his power and skill throughout the championship, not least in the last two Ulster championship games when defences have opened up. No longer an unknown quantity, McCarron has dealt with the expectation that comes with being on the county , and produced consistent quality performances in the blue of Steelstown. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Not a man in Derry would have begrudged Neil Forester the chance to lt the Bateson Sheridan Lee Cup this season. Led by example and had the experience to organise games at key moments. First shackling Enda Lynn in the final, his versatility in pressing on in the final quarter helped spark the final push that delivered delirium in the Maiden City. Pic by Mary K Burke.  His withdrawal in the final was a blow to Greenlough and gave Steelstown the boost they needed to go on and win the game. As prolic as ever during the  season, Lynn was the perfect foil for the electric Niall Loughlin, sharing the scoring burden and proving creator-in-chief for the St Oliver Plunketts side in both their league and championship campaigns. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Pace, trickery and clinical finishing are all in McMonagles locker. He nailed the pressurised free to take the Derry title and has cut loose in the open spaces of the Ulster intermediate series. The corner forward exudes a real joy in playing the game, and has shown a relish for taking on opposition defenders in one-on-one situations, often leaving them in a flap. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Again the focal point of the Plunketts attack, Loughlin destroyed Slaughtmanus with -, hit a further - against Drumsurn and - in the sticky surroundings of the county final. Followed up a fine early season showing with the county side by shooting his side to within a whisker of back-to-back Derry intermediate titles. Once again a serious threat. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Another man to take advantage of Steelstowns free-scoring plan, Murray has used his pace well. Hit a point in the county final. Murray has produced performances of such consistency throughout the season that he finished the year among the championships top scorers, and made hay in the open fields of the Ulster intermediate championship.

Pic by Ramsey Cardy Sportsfile. googletag.cmd.push Brendan Rogers  “Ive barely trained all week,” said Rogers after his - haul in the Ulster semi final win over Dunloy. The Emmets man had risen from his sick bed to down the Cuacutechullains, producing a superb performance in his relatively new role in midfield. A week later, he repeated the trick, finding the net against Ballycran as Slaughtneil lted their fourth Ulster title. In this form, Rogers is unplayable. He hit scores from distance. He won dirty ball. He linked the play, and at crucial moments, he took off at a canter, beat the defenders and put the ball in the net. That ability has the effect of both unsettling opposition defences and getting maroon and white-clad supporters in the the stands on their feet. In the feedback, one respondent said Rogers was an absolute pleasure to watch and a reliable, classy player. Others said his selection was an easy choice and hailed him as a match winner, while a further response said no words needed. “He is the man that has driven Slaughtneil forward this year in both Derry and Ulster championships, and has been a class act,” suggested a further respondent. One response simply said the man is lethal. The Emmets will certainly hope so, and all of Rogers attributes will be required as they head into an All-Ireland semi final meeting with either Ballygunneror Kilmallock .

Young Hurler of the Year  McLaughlin celebrates his goal against Cootehill. Pic by Seamus McQuillan Mono Pix. Ruaidhriacute McLaughlin  In what has been a breakthrough season for the Na Magha corner forward, Ruaidhriacute McLaughlin has shown plenty of promise. With his side labouring against Cavan champions Cootehill in the Ulster quarter final, it was the young star who rattled the net to calm their nerves. McLaughlin is a lively attacker, whose clever movement has the result of both creating room for himself and freeing up space for his fellow forwards. His ability to appear in the right place at the right time was recognised in the feedback, with one respondent saying he got scores when they were needed at crucial times. Another said he slotted into the team with a quiet confidence, while a further response said he was the most committed young hurler in the county. “Brilliant young player. Fantastic, consistent playing at every match. Shines at every game and is an outstanding team player, always puts the team first,” added another. A fine season in the Antrim league as well as on the Derry and Ulster scene have laid the foundations for the Na Magha man to push forward in .

Pic by Cathal McOscar. googletag.cmd.push Eunan McElhennon  In a year where Desertmartin perfected the attack from deep-lying positions, McElhennon was a key weapon. Whether it was bursting forward with the ball, or getting on the end of a sweeping move, the electric half back was on the score sheet regularly. He found the net with an outstanding inidual effort in the Derry semi final win over Craigbane, and continued his scoring run throughout the Ulster championship campaign. One respondent on the feedback form pointed to McElhennons speed, strength and shooting, while another said you could play him anywhere on the pitch. A further response said he was the best half back in Derry and Ulster for his speed and skill on the ball, while another hailed him as an influential player. “He played some great, entertaining football and was very focused and smart on the field,” added another. One respondent simply nominated Runabout McElhennon, while another said he was easily the best player on the pitch in nearly every game this season. Ending the year with two junior medals to his name, along with his Desertmartin team mates, the half back can be well satisfied with his performances.

Young Junior Footballer of the Year  Murray capped the season with his first start for Derry seniors last night. Pic by Cathal McOscar. Lachlan Murray  Murray wasnt even eligible for Desertmartins first junior success this season, but their full forward was busy anyway, helping secure Ulster and All-Ireland minor titles for Derry. Eager not to miss out, he added the  junior football title to his growing medal collection, and featured strongly in the run to the Ulster junior semi final. With St Martins clearly the team to beat at this level, they faced packed defences wherever they went, with Murray having to work hard to create the space he needed. And he did. Sean Dolans Rory McGurk used his experience to curb Murrays enthusiasm in the early stages of the county final, but he did what talented young players do. The teenager adapted his game and maintained his composure to slot six points from frees as Desertmartin eventually won by ten points. One respondent to the feedback said Murray was the main man in that Desertmartin team, while another said he had a bit of everything in his game. “An exceptional talent. Eight points in the county minor final, performances for Derry minors and made the step to junior football easily,” added another. A part of Rory Gallaghers provisional squad for , there is an exciting future ahead for Lachlan Murray.

Pic by Mary K Burke. googletag.cmd.push Neil Forester  “Is this real ” yelled a delirious Neil Forester at the end of his sides championship final win over Greenlough. Youd forgive him for asking. The Brian Oacutegs captain has seen years of heartache and near misses, and when the crunch arrived in November, he produced a huge performance to finally clamber over the line. Starting the game on Enda Lynn, he pushed forward in the latter stages and marshalled attack and defence, almost omnipresent as Steelstown ended their hurt. It typied the leadership he showed all season, and he was central also as Brian Oacutegs shook off what was historically their bogey team in Castledawson at the quarter final stage. The public feedback reflected the good will towards a man very few would begrudge a county championship medal. “He puts his head where you wouldnt put a sock,” said one respondent, while another simply said he was a brilliant leader. A further respondent said he was a real GAA man. “He does it all for his club, other clubs and schools all around Derry and still puts in big performances when it matters. Heart of a lion and wise beyond his years,” they said. A hugely important player for Hugh McGraths men, Forester will continue the search for silverware this weekend as Steelstown take on Moortown in the Ulster IFC final in Glen.  Young stars join up with Derrys provisional football squad  A number of the All-Ireand winning minor team are training with the seniors.   Young Intermediate Footballer of the Year  The young midfielders aerial prowess was key to the Brian Oacutegs effort. Pic by Mary K Burke. Donncha Gilmore  Its been quite a year for Donncha Gilmore. He picked up Ulster and All-Ireland titles with the Derry minors and ended the year with an intermediate championship medal. The midfielder belied his years with a series of confident, mature performances in a championship where seasoned giants are in plentul supply at centre field. With the county final in the melting pot, he rose to field the ball among a scattering of players, raising a roar from the crowd and lting his team mates. The Steelstown man was a popular choice throughout the public feedback, with his exploits in the Oakleaf jersey no doubt contributing. “He has been brilliant for Derry and Steelstown, an All-Ireland winner and a Derry championship winner, with more to come,” said one respondent. Another said he covered every blade of grass throughout the championship, while another – who was liberal with the blue and yellow heart emojis – said he was pure class. In a nod to the midfielders modesty and work ethic, another response said the young man has no idea just how good he is. Gilmore can look forward to Sundays Ulster IFC final as well, and will feature in manager Rory Gallaghers provisional squad for the upcoming season.

Pic by Philip Fitzpatrick Sportsfile. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McFaul  If great players have everything in their locker, Ciaran McFaul probably needed a second one last season. The Glen talisman was imperious in the number  role into which Malachy ORourke moulded him in . In the biggest game of the year, the county final against Slaughtneil, he hammered over three points and dictated the game in the same manner he had done all season. That Donegal champions St Eunans set out to shut him down in their Ulster SFC clash in Letterkenny is a mark of just how influential McFaul has been. His name also dominated the responses to our online poll, with one respondent in particular waxing lyrical, saying McFall was arguably the greatest talent ever produced in Derry football. “What an absolute work horse he is on the field, any position that man turns the bolts in any match. He can read a game super and his dummies are without a doubt the best in Ulster,” said another. A further respondent said he redefined the number  role, while another quite simply said the centre back was pure class. Able to dictate play from deep, he has arrived on the end of attacks with perfect timing, while also performing his defensive duties with commitment.  Derry manager looking for continuity after stop-start tenure to date  Rory Gallagher said he was delighted to see theof the McKenna Cup.   Young Senior Footballer of the Year  Doherty in action against Kilcoo in the Ulster semi final. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile. Ethan Doherty  Ethan Doherty was still at school when the Covid pandemic started. Less than two years later, he helped Glen lt the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time. Stepping straight into the first team at both club and county level, the rise of the former St Patricks College captain has been meteoric. Every inch the modern wing back, his power, pace and ability to break the line have been a key part of Malachy ORourkes Glen machine. The GAA community in Derry have also been quick to recognise his precocious talent, and he was a hugely popular choice in our public feedback. Amid numerous goat emojis, one respondent suggested he could play anywhere, while another said his selection as Young Player of the Year was merely common sense. “The engine of Glens back line with constant running. He never gave up and always looked to drive the ball forward to create scoring opportunities,” said a further response. One particular respondent kept it simple, nominating him for the award because he roasts everyone. Doherty is a player with a big future, and, already performing at the highest level for both club and county, the possibilities seem almost endless.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Caoimhín Doherty Jan Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Morgan Murray and Steelstown have their focus set on the club’s first ever Ulster intermediate final against Moortown at Glen on Sunday. googletag.cmd.push Steelstown are coming off the back of their first ever championship and they hope their support on the sideline will help them push on again and double their success. Murray admits his side will have to ‘dig deep’ against a strong team in what are likely to be tough conditions. “It’s evident after the county final that our fans played a big part in helping us over the line,” he said. “The support from them throughout the game was unbelievable and once that final whistle went, it was emotional celebrating with huge club figures who have been there so long. “It’s a special feeling having your family there on the day too, and when we got over the line, having them there made the victory that much sweeter.” Winning the county final was special, says Murray. Pic by Mary K Burke. The -year-old also added how he expects another big turnout despite the weather conditions. An All-Ireland semi final is the prize for the winners, but Morgan insists the ‘Oacutegs’ are not looking that far ahead. “We don’t like to get too far ahead of ourselves, we always just take it one game at a time,” he said. “Obviously,the situation comes that we’re in an All-Ireland semi final, we will be more than prepared, but at the minute, Moortown on Sunday is where our focus lies.” This is Morgan’s first year on the senior side after impressing last year with Steelstown’s reserve team. Murray admits it was a dficult campaign for himself last season with injuries and missing out on senior football. “I was training with the seniors but wasn’t getting to play with the seniors, so I was playing reserve football,” he said. “That was disappointing, and injuries didn’t help, but it just motivated me to push myself on to demand my place on the senior squad. “Reserve football gave me the opportunity to enjoy my football again. “And as I said, I was still in around the seniors, seeing how far they had gone having reached the final and seeing that togetherness, it gave me the drive to be part of it.”  CDP Team of the Year : Intermediate Football  We take a look at the players who made the final XV.   The left-footed forward’s drive and determination in last year’s campaign has landed him where he is today in the Steelstown senior squad. “Thankfully this year, my coaches have put a lot of faith in me and that’s pushing me to perform week in week out,” he said. “I’m very grateful to have had a big part in the team this year and winning the club’s first ever Championship is something that will stay with me forever.” The Pennyburn man has scored a championship total of - and earned his place in the County Derry Post’s Intermediate Team of the Year for  – alongside seven of his teammates. Going into the final, Moortown have an average of . points conceded per game while Steelstown sit at . points. The Derry men are typically big scorers in their games, but Morgan played down the signicance of the statistics. “I don’t think they’re relevant, to be honest,” he said. “It’s an Ulster championship final so anything can happen, but I’m confident that come the final whistle, we’ll have done enough to win the game.”  PREVIEW: Tyrone champions will be Ulster final favourites, says McGrath  Steelstown take on Moortown in Sundays intermediate decider.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Steelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!Second half comeback sees Brian Ogs overcome MoortownSteelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Moortown - Steelstown - Steelstown Brian Ogs are the Ulster Intermediate champions after a determined second half showing to overcome Moortown at Owenbeg. googletag.cmd.push Hugh McGraths team looked to be in some trouble as they managed just one single score in the entirety of the first half, and trailed -, - at the break, having struggled to get through Moortowns blanket defence. Peter Devlin hit each of Moortowns scores in that period, while Cahir McMonagle responded with Steelstowns first score on  minutes. But it was a frustrating first half for the Derry side who hit four wides as they struggled to replicate their usual free-scoring game. It required a dferent type of skill in the second half and when McMonagle struck again just nine minutes in, Brian Ogs had hope. Time continued to tick away but  minutes into the second period, McMonagle struck his third point, a real beauty to tie up the game at -, and the travelling Steelstown crowd sensed the title was there for the taking. With just minutes remaining, Emmet Deane first Steelstown into the lead for the first time, and when McMonagle hit his fourth point of the game soon after, the job was almost done. Con Heron fisted the ball over the bar for Moortowns first core of the second half to make it a one-point game again, but in the dying seconds McMonagle struck again, with the final whistle following shortly afterwards to confirm Steelstown Brian Ogs as the Ulster champions for the first time in the clubs history.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Steelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!Second half comeback sees Brian Ogs overcome MoortownSteelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Moortown - Steelstown - Steelstown Brian Ogs are the Ulster Intermediate champions after a determined second half showing to overcome Moortown at Owenbeg. googletag.cmd.push Hugh McGraths team looked to be in some trouble as they managed just one single score in the entirety of the first half, and trailed -, - at the break, having struggled to get through Moortowns blanket defence. Peter Devlin hit each of Moortowns scores in that period, while Cahir McMonagle responded with Steelstowns first score on  minutes. But it was a frustrating first half for the Derry side who hit four wides as they struggled to replicate their usual free-scoring game. It required a dferent type of skill in the second half and when McMonagle struck again just nine minutes in, Brian Ogs had hope. Time continued to tick away but  minutes into the second period, McMonagle struck his third point, a real beauty to tie up the game at -, and the travelling Steelstown crowd sensed the title was there for the taking. With just minutes remaining, Emmet Deane first Steelstown into the lead for the first time, and when McMonagle hit his fourth point of the game soon after, the job was almost done. Con Heron fisted the ball over the bar for Moortowns first core of the second half to make it a one-point game again, but in the dying seconds McMonagle struck again, with the final whistle following shortly afterwards to confirm Steelstown Brian Ogs as the Ulster champions for the first time in the clubs history.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Orlagh Mullan Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Sunday th January  is a day that Steelstown will never forget. The day that they became champions of Ulster for the first time in their history. googletag.cmd.push Just two and a half months after winning their first Derry championship, the men of Brian Oacuteg’s came through their toughest challenge yet to overcome a dogged Moortown by - to - at a packed Owenbeg. Having dispatched of Cloughaneely, Donaghmoyne and Butlersbridge in some style on their way to the provincial showpiece, this was a totally dferent game in which Steelstown where often frustrated and only led for the first time in the th minute but, by the final whistle, they didn’t care one bit.  As manager Hugh McGrath took in the scenes of blue and gold on the field afterwards, he said it was a special and unforgettable day for the people of Steelstown, and also paid tribute to the late Brian Oacuteg McKeever after whom the club is named. “We thought Derry champions sounded good, but Ulster champions certainly has a ring to it! When you put the hard work in that these lads have and you’ve had so many close calls and disappointments, to get over the line in something so close and so tight and so nervy – it just means even more. Steelstown as Ulster champions is one that will live in the memory for a long time,” he said. “All week leading up to it there was an excitement in the group about being in the final but the big thing we were saying was that we were so proud that Brian Oacuteg’s name was being mentioned on a provincial level and in some places on a national level. For us that’s huge. McGrath continued: “We all know in the city what he was about and why we’re named after him, but when you see the way we dug that out today – that’s Brian Oacuteg McKeever. That spirit is exactly what it was. “We’re really proud. Lots of teams say that they’re proud, but we are immensely proud of getting that name on the map and hopefully we can get it on the national stage and make even more people aware of that. Evenit’s just to get them interested and to find out why we’re called Brian Oacuteg’s – great – because that story needs to be told all over.” DREAM COME TRUE As Steelstown captain Neil Forester made his way up the steps of Owenbeg to collect the cup, the only words he could utter were ‘this is the stuff of dreams.’ “It hasn’t sunk in,” admitted Forester afterwards. “There was maybe huge relief and satisfaction after the county final, but this is a dferent level. “Getting out of Derry was such a big thing for us because we just hadn’t done it. I kept saying just get past Cloughaneely in the first round and then you get the ball rolling then you don’t know what can happen with the momentum. We were brilliant that day, but the crossbar still had to save us and maybe that was that little bit of luck we needed. “This team has just grown and grown. To win an Ulster title against a fantastic and dogged Moortown team in conditions that probably suited them and their defensive style is special. The fact that all those habits and the hard work that we put in has paid off. “It’s literally unbelievable. We were talking about getting our monkey off the back in Derry but once we did that we have just kicked on so much. I honestly don’t know what  to say.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

As manager Hugh McGrath took in the scenes of blue and gold on the field afterwards, he said it was a special and unforgettable day for the people of Steelstown, and also paid tribute to the late Brian Oacuteg McKeever after whom the club is named. “We thought Derry champions sounded good, but Ulster champions certainly has a ring to it! When you put the hard work in that these lads have and you’ve had so many close calls and disappointments, to get over the line in something so close and so tight and so nervy – it just means even more. Steelstown as Ulster champions is one that will live in the memory for a long time,” he said. “All week leading up to it there was an excitement in the group about being in the final but the big thing we were saying was that we were so proud that Brian Oacuteg’s name was being mentioned on a provincial level and in some places on a national level. For us that’s huge. McGrath continued: “We all know in the city what he was about and why we’re named after him, but when you see the way we dug that out today – that’s Brian Oacuteg McKeever. That spirit is exactly what it was. “We’re really proud. Lots of teams say that they’re proud, but we are immensely proud of getting that name on the map and hopefully we can get it on the national stage and make even more people aware of that. Evenit’s just to get them interested and to find out why we’re called Brian Oacuteg’s – great – because that story needs to be told all over.” DREAM COME TRUE As Steelstown captain Neil Forester made his way up the steps of Owenbeg to collect the cup, the only words he could utter were ‘this is the stuff of dreams.’ “It hasn’t sunk in,” admitted Forester afterwards. “There was maybe huge relief and satisfaction after the county final, but this is a dferent level. “Getting out of Derry was such a big thing for us because we just hadn’t done it. I kept saying just get past Cloughaneely in the first round and then you get the ball rolling then you don’t know what can happen with the momentum. We were brilliant that day, but the crossbar still had to save us and maybe that was that little bit of luck we needed. “This team has just grown and grown. To win an Ulster title against a fantastic and dogged Moortown team in conditions that probably suited them and their defensive style is special. The fact that all those habits and the hard work that we put in has paid off. “It’s literally unbelievable. We were talking about getting our monkey off the back in Derry but once we did that we have just kicked on so much. I honestly don’t know what  to say.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made. I would expect nothing less from one of the best people I ever knew. Thank you for everything Sean. Until we meet again.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made. I would expect nothing less from one of the best people I ever knew. Thank you for everything Sean. Until we meet again.

Festival organisers plan to give out the honours at an in-person event in the coastal Calornia town on March  . The eight actors singled out for the award also include newcomers, such as Saniyya Sidney, who plays Venus Williams in King Richard, and Coda’s Emilia Jones and Troy Kotsur, as well as more familiar faces, including Simon Rexand Dornan. The event, hosted by TCM’s Dave Karger, will include discussions with the talent – which could for some be a stop on the road to the Oscars on March . Karger said the honorees are “integral parts of the season’s most exciting and emotional films”. Previous recipients have included Zendaya, Riz Ahmed and Awkwafina. The long-running film festival, now in its th year, regularly attracts more than , attendees to the idyllic town for films,  and tributes. The full line-up for the early March gathering will be unveiled in February.

Registration had opened months in advance and entries sold out in record time, a clear indication that this race has become a firm favourite for the elite and the not so elite runner.For most, it is the sense of turning up on the day not knowing what to expect. The race has two unique selling points.Firstly, you have to run with a partner and you are only ever as good as your other half.Many alliances come unstuck on the hills and in the mud and friendships are often lost, regained and lost again as the race unfolds.Secondly, and perhaps more uniquely, only a select few know the course in advance and they are sworn to secrecy.This is unusual in that most of us go to a race knowing what to expect in terms of distance, terrain and elevation: not so with this one.The only information is that it begins and ends in Castlewellan and it is between eight-and-a-half and nine miles .The course this year was a very tightly guarded secret with only those entrusted to assist with the marking on the eve of the race getting any real insight.When asked to describe the course, the Prophet simply stated: lsquoit will stun the legs and play with the headrsquo.These words rang in my head as I ran around fields that I never expected to, climbed hills that I never climbed before and at one point,my eyesight is not failing, saw Sherpa Tenzing throwing down ropes and herding a cabinet of yaks.At the business end of proceeding, there was some real class on parade with Irish mountain running sensation Zak Hannapaired with Andrew Annett , a man in great form as evidenced by his superb win in the Armagh Ten.This international pairing with real climbing pedigree firmly lived up to their billing as odds-on favourites and were almost three minutes ahead of their nearest challengers, the youthful pairing of Jared Martinand Tom Crudgington .With many years of running ahead, both these young men are capable of winning the race in the not-too-distant future.The podium was completed by the last minute pairing of Jonny Scottand Aaron McGrady , who hooked up on the morning of the event due to late withdrawals.The chemistry was clearly good and the partnership worked as they came home in just over  minutes ndash  seconds adrt of Martin and Crudgington.The ladiesrsquo race was a tighter affair with Amanda Perry and Denise Logue from Ballydrain winning by  seconds from Dearbhla Coxand Niamh Donnelly .The podium was completed by Clair Quigley and Fiona McQuillan .The mixed team event is always closely fought and this year was no dferent. With a mile to go to the finish, eventual winners Aidan Brownand Nakita Burkewere still under pressure from Stephen Connolly and Caitlyn Harvey from North Down AC.However, in the final twists and turns the former prevailed and ran out winners by around a minute, finishing eighth and tenth overall respectively.The podium was completed by Neil McGeough, Newcastlersquos rising star, and his partner, Irish Olympian Kerry OrsquoFlaherty, an athlete more at home on the track and over barriers than climbing ditches.Throughout the field there was great camaraderie and the craic was mighty. Social media was buzzing after the race with participants commenting that this was the best course they had ever ran over, despite the numerous challenges that it presented.The race organisers are indebted to everyone, too many to mention inidually, who contributed in any way to the success of the event.It brought great joy to those taking part and spectating at a time when anything that improves our well-being is something to celebrate..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"McCartan hopes for dream start back at the helm  ","story":"DOWN manager James McCartan will be looking for a dream start to hisat the helm this Friday when his Mourne side take on Donegal in the first round of the Dr McKenna Cup.The red and black outfit will travel to MacCumhail Park for a .pm throw-in, in what will be the first piece of action for the county this year.The ing fan favourite will not be under any illusions as to the level of stf competition his footballers will face off against, as they travel to the home of last yearrsquos Ulster semi-finalists.Antrim are the other outfit that make up Section A, with Down welcoming the Saffrons to Newry in their second game next Tuesday.McCartan has already faced adversities in his second stint as boss before his team have even lined out, due to a number of regular Mourne players ruled out of contention.Carryduff duo James Guinness and Owen McCabe, Bryansford shot-stopper Marc Reid and experienced Burren duo Gerard McGovern and Donal OrsquoHare are among those unavailable.The former All-Star man in charge, alongside assistant Aidan OrsquoRourke, have already began drafting in suitable replacements and have recently been given a notable boost in the form of ing former captain Niall McParland.The Glenn clubman has ed following three years teaching in Doha, Qatar, and will be someone who McCartan looks to in order to bring his wealth of experience to the rest of the side ndashespecially those who are up and coming talents.ldquoThe squad has changed but itrsquos good to see some new faces in the , said McParland.ldquoJames and Aidan have a handle on everyone in the county and they have a good squad together so far.ldquoI was happy to get the call to go back because I didnrsquot knowI would get it ndash I donrsquot take anything for granted, he continued.ldquoNow Irsquom fighting for my place in the team.Alongside this encouraging news for the county, current star Barry OrsquoHagan believes Down could benefit even further from an influx of Kilcoo players.However, the current champions of Down are currently hoping to retain their Ulster title when they face off against Derrygonnelly on January , which will see them out of action until things unfold.With this meaning they will not be available for selection for the Dr McKenna Cup, this doesnrsquot necessarily rule out some of the  featuring in the Division Two league campaign.ldquoAt the minute, therersquos probably eight or nine of them you would definitely want in, said OrsquoHagan.ldquoWhether they commit or not I donrsquot know, itrsquos up to those men, but you need the talent and the experience those boys have.ldquoObviously their full focus is on Kilcoo at the minute, as yoursquod expect..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_TableTennis.jpg","title":"Owenbeg are on title march  ","story":"IT was an early Christmas present for Owenbeg with a double win over St Johnrsquos to keep their Division One title hopes on track.The current league champions still have three outstanding matches with league leaders Banbridge, so it is still all to play for in this ision.In Division Two, Drumaness kept their title hopes alive with their win over St Johnrsquos.

He also taught commercial subjects like arithmetic and bookkeeping, for use in commerce and industry.Dr Neilson and his clergymen sons were notable for their warm cross-denominational outlook.Fr Luke Walsh, PP in North Antrim, near Ballycastle, spoke highly of his old Kilmore tutor: ldquoI was educated by a Presbyterian clergyman, a man of as great moral worth and sterling integrity as Ireland could boast of.In , as Bishop of Down and Dromore, William Crolly described Rev James Neilson of Downpatrick as ldquoone of the most liberal and respected clergymen in Co Down.Around  Moses began compiling an Irish grammar, later assisted by his son William. In their pursuit of Irish studies, the two Neilsons collaborated with Patrick Lynch, principal of a distinguished Irish and Classical academy in Loughinisland, six miles away.In March  William Neilson was installed as minister of Dundalk Presbyterian Church. This was a perfect fit for his developing academic interests. Attached to the Dundalk congregation was a colony of Gaelic-speaking Scots Presbyterians living in Ballymascanlon.Originally from Argylle, they had fought for King William in . Hence it was a standing requirement that the congregationrsquos clergy be fluent in Irish.William thrived in Dundalk. In the late s Irish was still the first language with large parts of the population in Down and Louth . He preached widely in Irish. In July  he went on a preaching tour of Ulster, achieving wide popularity.RebellionBack in Co Down, and during the  Rebellion period, his preaching activities on one occasion brought him into collision with the military authorities. His father was actually Moderator in the year of the Rising.Dr Moses needed permission from General Nugent to hold the General Synodin Lurgan that August. One Sunday in  his son William was invited back to his fatherrsquos church, to preach in Irish. The event generated considerable interest, and the church was packed.The authorities were nervous in the wake of the rebellion and news of this unusually large assembly soon reached official ears.Halfway through the sermon a party of yeomen entered the church. With no space left to seat them, they occupied the twin staircases leading up to the pulpit. When William had finished preaching they promptly arrested him, and seized theof his sermon.The soldiers involved were likely from the Kilmore Yeomanry. Their Lieutenant at the time was Charles Hamilton, William Strain of Kilmore was a sergeant, and Patrick Soy of \"Tollinagrew\" a private.They marched William all the way to Down Gaol in Downpatrick, newly opened on the Mall in  . Their arrival likely caused some consternation with the Gaol Governor, because the Neilson clergy were widely known to be loyal to the Crown.Rev William bailed by Rev JamesScrambling to smooth over this military faux pas, the Governor sent across town for James Neilson, brother of the prisoner, and minister of the nearby Stream Street Presbyterian congregation. The Rev William was then bailed into the custody of the Rev James,with instructions to appear in court next day.Next morning the magistrate encountered a dficulty mdash he couldnrsquot understand the manuscript of Williamrsquos sermon, preached in Irish the day before. William helpfully offered to translate. It transpired the contents were innocuous, and the prisoner was promptly released. The details of this intriguing episode were recorded a century later by a Neilson descendant .Academic careerIn Dundalk William ran a Classical and mercantile academy similar to his fatherrsquos. In an astonishing burst of creativity, he continued to develop his skills as a linguist.In  he published Greek exercises in syntax, ellipsis, dialects, prosody and metaphrasis. In recognition of this, Glasgow University awarded him an honorary DD in . In  he was elected Presbyterian Moderator. In  he published Introduction to the Irish language, on the basis of which he was elected MRIA in .There were a number of advantages in learning Irish, William explained. For academics, it gave essential insights into other European languages. And for the wider population, it enabled competent communication with those large sections of the population whose first language was still Irish.In contemporary Ireland, he asserted, clergymen, lawyers and farmers could not conduct their business properly without a knowledge of Irish.Paradoxically, the subjects taught in schools run by the Neilson clergy, and others, eventually undermined the use of Irish nationally. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and employment opportunities in industry and commerce were exploding.For those without a knowledge of English, Irish-only fluency was becoming an overwhelming disadvantage. When the new national school system was instituted in Ireland in , teachers knew that English was now the essential passport to wider employment.The great Daniel OrsquoConnell ruefully acknowledged the new reality. ldquoAlthough the language is associated with many recollections that twine round the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication is so great, that I can witness, without a sigh, the gradual disuse of Irish.At that time there were a number of ieties of Irish, but under the new dispensation the vernacular spoken in East Ulster eventually became extinct. Fortunately William Neilson preserved many Co Down examples in his  Grammar. In the words of his descendant Joseph Nelson, Williamrsquos ldquodialogues and familiar phrases, which form the second part, are a complete guide to the ideas as well as the phrases of the peasantry.Untimely deathIn  William was appointed professor of classical languages and Hebrew at the Belfast Academical Institution. In April  he was elected professor of Classics at Glasgow University. However, he had contracted rheumatic fever, and died on the th of that month, aged only . He was buried in the family vault close to the west gable of his fatherrsquos church in Rademon.A full colour pamphlet based on this article has been produced by Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Group, to accompany Joyce Gibsonrsquos ongoing Irish language classes in Ballynahinch Market House..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5January2022_LinenHall.jpg","title":"Tributes to former chief librarian at Linen Hall Library who was also decorated Gaelic player  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND man who was the custodian of some of Northern Irelandrsquos most precious books and written history will be buried tomorrow.The former chief librarian of Belfastrsquos Linen Hall Library, John Killen was hailed as a ldquogentleman and friend to all after he died peacefully at his home on Sunday.A respected author, historian and former Gaelic footballer, Mr Killen was aged .He had worked at Irelandrsquos oldest and last subion library for  years and became friends with some of its most regular visitors, such as the poet Seamus Heaney, writers Sam Hanna Bell, John Hewitt, Joseph Tomelty and the artist Padraic Woods.Mr Killen retired in January , after taking up his first role as an Irish reference librarian at the Linen Hall in .He was known for continuing the work of a former colleague, Jimmy Vitty, by establishing an extensive political papers section of posters, prisonersrsquo books and records from the Maze Long Kesh.The collection houses more than , separate items and is now used by academics and students from across the world.Among the many books written by Mr Killen was the story of the  year-old library, along with the Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.One of his most recent books was The St Patrickrsquos Treasury, a celebration of the myths, legends and traditions of Irelandrsquos patron saint who is buried in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Mr Killen was also highly regarded as a county hurler and Gaelic footballer who won championship medals, having played for his home club Loughinisland, Downpatrickrsquos RGU and Queenrsquos.Loughinisland GAC said on social media the club was ldquodevastated to learn of Mr Killenrsquos death who had also been a member and secretary in .He won two championship medals with the club in  and .Mr Killen, who was reared in Saul, started as a Gaelic footballer with RGU.He won several Minor championships medals for the Downpatrick side, including leading them to victory over Loughinisland in the SFC final in .Queenrsquos GAA remembered on social media how Mr Killen was a former Sigerson Cup player from - and was also part of the first All-Ireland Freshers winning team in .The Linen Hall Library shared its reaction to the sad news on social media.It said of its former head: ldquoJohn joined the Library in  and dedicated the next  years to this institution.

I have seen on many occasions that there remain equality issues for women in work places.ldquoI have three daughters who all have professional jobs.

Forwe donrsquot work together, then nothing changes.ldquoMy programmes are embracing, not preaching. They aim to break down the dferences we have as a society by promoting better knowledge, tolerance and understanding.ldquoThe laws that govern us all, especially those written in relation to females, do definitely need to change for equality to happen.She continued: ldquoWe, as a society, also have to encourage change from the ground level up. Educating our young people and changing adult preconceived perceptions are also so important.ldquoBoys and girls, men and women. We are all iniduals who should be treated fairly and equally. By law, and by society in general.ldquoIt is therefore important to engage and stand up for change now.

The city centre is separated from surrounding communities.

This would resolve the long-standing sense of regret that there is in parts of west and north Belfast at having been segregated from the heart of the capital by a wide, noisy motorway.This intriguing plan, incidentally, is a reminder of why it is important to proceed with the York Street interchange to seamlessly link the M, M and Westlink M. Far from cutting the York Street and Shore Road area off from the city, as critics allege, it would separate slower and pedestrian north-south traffic from the busy junction and allow it to travel over the highway.Other welcome ideas from Belfast Chamber include connecting the city even more closely to the Lagan, in keeping with its maritime past. The existing regeneration of the Lagan and docks area has been one of Belfast’s success stories. Well done Belfast Chamber for thinking creatively and looking at innovations from cities round the world for inspiration in how to make NI’s much-loved biggest city all the more desirable.Northern IrelandBelfast City CouncilBelfastWestlinkGreat Britain  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularWall of silence: Home Office suggests it is dangerous to tell public details about turning Carrickfergus hotel into base for foreign nationals‘Deep sadness’ as former Church of Ireland Bishop of Clogher, father of singer-songwriter Neil Hannon, diesCash taken by armed gang during burglary in Co DownProtestant churches and schools fail to promote our faith and cultureFuneral of murder victim Aidan Mann who is remembered by brother as “one in a trillion”Most PopularBest gym shoes UK: workout trainers for CrossFit, weightlting and cardio, from Nike, On, Inov-, ReebokBest men’s gym clothes UK: top training gear from Nike DriFit, GymShark, Adidas, Reebok, and Under Armour                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Henry McDonald writes: \"Millions of others in Oz have stoically put up with the emergency health measures in their country for nearly two years. Why should the world’s greatest tennis player be treated any dferent from anyone  \" As someone with a compromised immune system, on eight tablets per day and only ten per cent of my stomach left after le-saving surgeryI was advised by my heart and oncology consultants to avoid any exposure to the pandemic.For nearly two years I swerved Coronavirus by adhering strictly to lockdown rules, wearing a mask when out, isolating, social distancing etc. When the welcome vaccines arrived, I readily embraced them and am now tripled jabbed. Anda fourth vaccine is offered and deemed essential to combat further spread of the disease, I will happily stick out my arm and get jagged.Despite all these precautions and the vaccinations, I finally succumbed to the virus over the New Year albeit of the Omicron iety. After emerging from seven days of pandemic purdah I can report that this strain was not as debilitating as the previous ones that have killed more than a million people around the world while seriously affecting the health of millions of others.The infection began with a burst of chills spreading all over the body leaving my frame shaking slightly for  hours. Then my throat started to scratch and ache while my nose ran repeatedly for under a week. Yet that was it. The worst symptoms of the infection petered out within a couple of days and the whole experience felt like a bad case of a winter cold not even flu. I have no doubt that having the booster jab back in November helped me quickly get over the Omicron virus.It was a mixed picture inside our bubble at home in Belfast: my sister tested negative throughout while her partner also caught the virus. His symptoms were even milder than mine and he too was triple vaccinated ahead of Omicron’s arrival.As for the source of our infections there were a host of potential viral triggers ranging from one friend who is unvaccinated to the disturbingly high number of peopleunmasked on a Glider journey from my partner’s house in Ballyhackamore into the city centre just after Christmas.Meanwhile my eldest daughter was felled by the virus shortly after Boxing Day in Australia her younger sister had been one of the early casualties of the first coronavirus wave which engulfed her Glasgow University student halls of residence back in the autumn of .Regarding the older daughter it is worth pointing out that she and her friends were caught in one of the most stringent lockdowns in the world in Melbourne for months on end. Despite the tight strictures on their lives in that shut down ‘Down Under’ they regarded it as necessary. They endured. They got through.This is why I have no sympathy for Novak Djokovic who is at the time of writing in lockdown in a government run hostel in Australia. He refuses to get vaccinated and is all over social media preaching against the vaccination programmes saving lives across the planet. Millions of others in Oz have stoically put up with the emergency health measures in their country for nearly two years. Why should the world’s greatest tennis player be treated any dferent from anyone  ! The longer the Australian government stand firm on the issue the more I shall admire them.One of the by-products of the pandemic and lockdown has been my own small act of solidarity with Australia, a nation that thousands of us in this part of the world have strong family connections with.During these years of the plague, I fell in love again with Aussie wine. I started searching wine merchants and supermarket shelves for Australian vino not just because I appreciate a decent Shiraz or robust Cabernet from down there. Australian wine makers have been one of the targets of a Chinese boycott after Canberra simply dared to ask for an independent international inquiry into how the virus originated in Wuhan.The dictatorship in Beijing was mfed that Australia even questioned their official narrative about how Covid- was unleashed on the world. China under Mr Xi’s tyrannical rule then imposed sanctions on Aussie exports including wine as a punishment for speaking out of turn. Anyone enraged at the cover up in Wuhan and the bullying behaviour of Beijing should support Australia while out shopping so long as that boycott continues.As I say small acts of solidarity but necessary ones ... a bit like getting vaccinated here in Northern Irelandnot for yourself then for the lives of others.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

As you will have heard in the media, this new Omicron iant of COVID is very infectious. But it does not appear to cause serious illnessyou have been double or triple vaccinated. But frankly I am shocked how badly the biochemistry of this virus has been explained by politicians and so-called experts. As a biochemist with an international reputation please forgive meI try to explain. When you are vaccinated in the arm the main antibody generated is called IgG. This should stop serious illness. But when you get infected in the respiratory tract you also produce another type called IgA. This is secreted into the tract. Also, there is a dferent T-lymphocyte response when you are infected directly there. So, vaccination in the arm will not necessarily stop you getting COVID because your vaccination doesnt activate the IgA production sufficiently. Furthermore, for your immune system to activate against COVID, you have to produce some of the virus and its antigen. This would make you test positive by PCR, which is very sensitive, and probably by lateral flow. Thus, the problem is thatyou get COVID, even mildly, then you would have to isolate for ten days, and this would spoil Christmas again. We can’t risk this. That is why Penarth Bridge Club will close until th January . But here is an interesting hand from last week where the challenge for North South was to bid a slam. But which one – six hearts or seven clubs The AuctionSouth opened the auction with his five-card heart suit. North with fteen points knows game must be on, and maybe a slam. So, he bid two clubs. South felt his hand was strong enough now to reverse, keeping his support for clubs till a later bid. North was tempted to jump to four hearts but this might prevent them reaching a slam. So, he bid three hearts, knowing his partner would bid on after his reverse bid of two spades. Indeed, South now needed to show his support for clubs and so bid four clubs. North now bid four no trumps, Roman key card Blackwood. They were playing   so South’s response of five diamonds must show three key cards with clubs as trumps. North now could see seven clubs must be on, as South’s key cards must be the ace of spades, the ace of hearts and the king of clubs..removeThe playTrick  – East led the queen of diamonds, declarer winning the trick with his ace of diamonds, discarding a spade from dummy. Trick  – North considered the hand. Was he going to take the spade finesse  In fact,the hearts were   or   then he could discard his losing spade on the final heart. But trumps first. He played the ace of clubs from his hand. Trick  – He followed this by winning the next trick with dummy’s king of clubs. Good news. The defenders trumps were  , so he would not have to risk taking the spade finesse. Tricks ,  and  - Declarer then won the next three tricks with his king and queen and dummy’s ace of hearts. Trick  – He then ruffed a heart in his hand, establishing dummy’s last heart as a winner. Trick  – Declarer then ed to dummy by ruffing a diamond. Trick  – He then played dummy’s winning last heart, discarding the two of spades from his hand. Tricks  and  – He then played the ace of spades, followed by a small spade which he ruffed in hand. Trick – Declarer then ruffed his last losing diamond with dummy’s last trump. Tricks  – Declarer then claimed the last trick with his remaining club, the grand slam making with thirteen tricks for score of  - one spade, four hearts, one diamond, two diamond ruffs in dummy, and five clubs in hand. Well bid and well played. Six hearts makes but not seven, because East held four trumps.What have we learnt . It is often a good idea to show your partner a strong hand by reversing, as here, before showing support for his suit.. Once again Roman key card Blackwood.is an essential part of your armoury to reach a slam.. Always checkyou can establish small cards in a suit by ruffing before considering a finesse.Penarth club resultsFriday  December . Trish Tracey and Tony Campbell. Jim Elder and Meryl Skipper.

Wouldn’t you just love to open up on all them Orangemen.”He was suspended by Inverness after that tweet appeared about the TV actor and documentary maker Ross Kemp who was in Belfast at an Orange Parade which had been blocked by police on the Woodvale Road.Gorman also played at Airdrie and Inverness Caledonian Thistle as well as Bray Wanderers and Drogheda United in the League of Ireland.The announcment to sign Mr Gorman produced a backlash with one person saying: “Portadown have now sunk to a new low, I for one will not be going to support any team this inidual is playing in.”Joe Gorman who has been signed by Portadown FC.Another said: “Joe Gormanyou’re a real man we’ll stand up and apologise to the orange men, plus to the people of Portadown who will be paying you wages which I’m sure isn’t cheap.”Supporting Mr Gorman, another person stated: “I’m sure there is not one man woman on here who have commented that have never been in a position of regret and have needed someone to hold out a hand and offer them a nd chance“If you can introduce me to someone who has never made a mistake then I’ll happily shake their hand.

She was the light of our lives, who made an impression on everyone she met. We as a family will never be able to put into words the impact of that morning’s events.\"Whilst we are under no illusion about the pressures and strains on the ambulance service, it is surely unacceptable that we had to wait one hour and ten minutes for an ambulance to arrive when our five-year-old daughter’s le was at stake. Fortunately, we contacted a family member, a local firefighter, to come to the scene he then dispatched the fire crew.\"We are truly grateful for the medical expertise, professionalism and kindness demonstrated by the fire service. As first responders with lesaving equipment we know that Maggie was given the best available support, this is the greatest comfort to us at this time.\"Dference between le and death\"We as a family and our community are truly shocked, worried and saddened that the dispatch of the fire service is not an automatic response in these situations. Sadly, not everyone in our community will get access to this emergency medical assistance during the crucial golden hour. This can ultimately mean the dference between le and death.\"The family went on to call for support from the wider community to guarantee \"the mandatory dispatch of the fire service in emergency situations to support our vulnerable rural families and ultimately give us all the best chance of le.\"Commenting on the petition, a spokesperson for the Department of Healthsaid: \"The DoH, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service , and the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Serviceextend their sincere condolences to the Black family and fully support any initiative to improve emergency medical cover in rural communities.\"As part of the emergency medical response to rural communities, a number of community responder schemes are in place across Northern Ireland which can be dispatched by NIAS alongside paramedics as required however, there are currently none covering the Glenarm area.\"Whilst these community volunteers generally do not attend incidents involving children under the age of , due to the specialist training and equipment required, NIAS would welcome approaches from any group of volunteers who express an interest in creating new local groups, including in the Glens of Antrim region.\"The NIAS and NIFRS are currently working together to progress the development of a regional joint response model, the spokesperson added: \"With regard to potential collaboration with NIFRS, NIAS previously ran a promising co-responder pilot in which NIFRS crews were dispatched to suspected cardiac emergency calls in the local catchment area of fire stations in addition to the normal emergency ambulance response.\"NIAS and NIFRS met in November  to consider how this model might be rolled out across Northern Ireland, and both organisations are working closely together to progress the development of a regional joint response model.\"Read More Read MoreTributes to Maggie: Five-year-old was full of fun and loved leNorthern Ireland Fire and Rescue ServicePetitionNorthern
